1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,799
um thanks everybody for for being here

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,799
and thanks for having us um we're going

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,720
to present in the next 30 minutes a

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,400
project that has been we've been working

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,559
on moritz and i for the last year and a

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,360
half

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,599
um and i was building a firing range for

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,440
industrial control systems

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,760
and we did that in our kitchen because

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,080
of corona so there was no way to do it

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,080
in the office and that's why that's

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,279
that's why

13
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,039
we're going to you can see we didn't

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,960
bring so we actually created a model we

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,400
didn't bring that but we're going to

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,760
show some um some videos of it later and

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,360
then for everybody to take away as well

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,800
the lessons that we learned so if you're

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
planning to build something similar in

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,040
your kitchen then you know what to

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,440
do and not just to do hopefully

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,680
um so roughly that's the the agenda for

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,320
the next 30 minutes um we

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600
try to get everybody on the same page

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,360
what we understand is firing ranges what

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,160
we understand as ot or operational uh

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,320
technology then mort will talk us

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,079
through how the building of the ics

29
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,840
firing is actually

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,760
unfolded we're going to demonstrate it

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,120
and then the lessons learned and then at

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,360
the end the questions

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,119
about us i'm niko i'm the red team lead

34
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,640
for nvizo

35
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,960
i've had my fair share in i.t security

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,360
and i focus on rt security as well in

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,280
the past two years

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,720
and most of you

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,600
sure my name is summers i'm part of the

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,520
software and security team and r d team

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,560
at enviso

42
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,680
and i'm an iot and ics enthusiast and i

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,520
try and get a hold of as many devices as

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,759
i can try and break them

45
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,159
um a few words about that viso um it's

46
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,759
it's a company that's roughly nine years

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,720
old originally founded in in brussels a

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,920
noun office in frankfurt in munich

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,320
we have 150 colleagues at the moment so

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,040
it's um it was just a very small subset

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,799
obviously um but what's interesting is

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,280
that inviso is dedicated to invest 10 of

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,600
the revenue into r d and that is how we

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,360
can fund this project and the time that

55
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
went into it um so that's um that's how

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,920
good that that happens

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
now firing ranges um what do we

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
understand as fine range of course it's

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,680
it's somewhat a controlled interactive

60
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,920
environment um it's an abstraction of a

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,520
real environment think of a toy train

62
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,440
for example instead of having the real

63
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
train of course to play with it should

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,120
be as realistic as possible and that's

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,959
what we try to do as well so you will

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,280
see that we built a a model of a basket

67
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
bridge so which that has leaves the

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,520
liftings we try to move letters as

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,239
closely to the real thing as possible it

70
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,400
should be reusable so we want to use it

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,800
for trying out stuff um in our context

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,560
it's i.t security so we want to try out

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,000
attacks for example or defense

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,360
mechanisms

75
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,440
and of course if we run an attack we

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,599
should be able to do it again and again

77
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,120
and it should have that playground

78
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,480
factor so it should be something where

79
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,840
we can approach things from different

80
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,440
angles and just see what happens if we

81
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,480
try that way and so on

82
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,440
why

83
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,280
do we need a fire range

84
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,040
so the first that comes to mind and that

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,480
was our motivation as well at the

86
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
beginning is for training purposes

87
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,200
so we we've done a lot of id security ot

88
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,360
security was fairly new to us back then

89
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,120
so what we wanted to do is to train our

90
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
people as well and ourselves on how to

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,200
approach ot next networks and how to do

92
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
security assessments on those

93
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,440
the the lab itself the way it turned out

94
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
is very suitable for awareness training

95
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
as well because it's very visual so if

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,959
you run an attack for example then you

97
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,959
can make some some lights stop blinking

98
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,560
or the bridge leaves are not moving

99
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
anymore something else is happening

100
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,519
there's a buzzer going off so for

101
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,920
awareness trainings for example um very

102
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,640
useful for testing if you had neo2

103
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,239
components for example pll plc's that

104
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,080
you want to try out that you've never

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
played with before you just plug it into

106
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,480
the lab or the firing range configured

107
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,640
and then make it work and then last but

108
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,000
not least for further development of

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,480
tools for example for forensics so we

110
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,239
actually used that lab for forensic

111
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,239
training as well um which

112
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,080
you'll see then at the end as well very

113
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,519
briefly

114
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,799
now um ot and ics operational technology

115
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,319
are computing systems that are used to

116
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,879
manage industrial operations for example

117
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,480
the manufacturing process

118
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
and the subset of that uh industrial

119
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,640
control system so the integration of

120
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,480
hardware and software components to

121
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,239
control processes for automation and

122
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,360
humanitarian institute mentalization

123
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,439
we do see two candidates here on the

124
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,360
slides on the right hand side you see a

125
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,839
programmer programmable logic control

126
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,519
it's very difficult for me to say that

127
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,400
plcs which is essentially the core unit

128
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,160
if you will of some automation process

129
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,440
so it's it's

130
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,199
the cpu that that runs was connected to

131
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,120
two sensors and actuators that drives

132
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,280
for example conveyor belts and so on and

133
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,120
then on the other side that's an hmi

134
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,560
human machine interface where the

135
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,120
operators normally oversee the process

136
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,520
they can start stop processes or react

137
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,360
on errors and and so on so it's just the

138
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,800
interaction with the machinery behind it

139
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,639
now um i bet you're all familiar with it

140
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,960
the what many might not be familiar with

141
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
is that there's a difference between

142
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,880
security requirements for operational

143
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
technology and i.t

144
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
whereas in iit normally you would

145
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
probably argue that confidentiality is

146
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,039
has high priority so you don't want a

147
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,039
customer database for example to leak to

148
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,199
the internet that would be very severe

149
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,520
of course if you shut down that database

150
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,360
i.e um

151
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,280
in regard to availability then that can

152
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,479
have some impact but it's probably not

153
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,039
on that same level whereas in ot it's

154
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,039
very different confidentiality usually

155
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,639
doesn't play a big factor but

156
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,400
availability does so

157
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
if you think about power plants for

158
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,039
example if they just switch off or steal

159
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,039
a steel mill and that

160
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,560
is corrupted somehow the process then

161
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,039
you need to restart that might take days

162
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,800
so there's a financial impact obviously

163
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,280
but also the the production behind just

164
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,520
the delay it takes to get every

165
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,600
everything back up and starting so

166
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
availability is key

167
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
now attacks against ics this is the

168
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
sun's ics cyberkill chain

169
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
it usually comes in what

170
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,560
as far as we know it comes in two stages

171
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,240
the first stage usually goes against the

172
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,639
it network so the way we know it there's

173
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,000
a resource development phase at the

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,680
beginning then delivery where for

175
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
example phishing emails are sent to

176
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,360
somebody working in the office

177
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,039
they click the attachment

178
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,319
um the the payload installs um on the

179
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,479
workstation ensures persistence and

180
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
establish c2 communication and then the

181
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,680
the adversary can act through the c2

182
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,440
channel and

183
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,720
yeah their objectives whatever maybe now

184
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,880
if the attack goes against ot then this

185
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,199
is also true so we are that that stage

186
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,520
where we have a foothold on the the

187
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,639
enterprise

188
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,759
um we then recon where is ot located we

189
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
identifying possible jump servers or dmz

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
that we need to pass through in order to

191
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,520
get there once we're there we locate the

192
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,759
targets we develop capabilities testing

193
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,280
them so that might be payloads that we

194
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,440
want to download on plc's for example

195
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,600
then we download them install and

196
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,280
execute the attack which could be the

197
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,680
disruption of some manufacturing process

198
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,080
for example

199
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
the objectives

200
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,639
of those attackers are commonly either

201
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,160
the the permanent loss of view of

202
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,599
control for the operator so that they

203
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,199
can't see the process they can't

204
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,880
interact with it anymore it could be

205
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,280
temporary only for vm control again but

206
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
also safety which is a very important

207
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,240
factor and the same of course for

208
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,479
manipulation and the safety aspect is

209
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,479
also very different to what we have in

210
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,479
i.t there's rarely at least i don't know

211
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
of any attacks against i.t

212
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,599
infrastructure where you would say

213
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,759
safety was a concern safety of people

214
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,599
specifically and we had a case in 2017

215
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,160
um which hadn't happened in saudi arabia

216
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,720
against a power plant where they found a

217
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,039
malware that targeted safety equipment

218
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,440
it didn't succeed but the assumption is

219
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,280
that if it would have compromised those

220
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
safety systems um it would have then

221
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
disabled some of the procedures that

222
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,160
would have triggered in cause of

223
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,680
emergencies for example if gas is

224
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
leaking um into the outside then those

225
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,080
safety systems would prevent this now if

226
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,319
you modify or manipulate that then you

227
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,080
couldn't or you wouldn't prevent it so

228
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,400
this would not only be then of course

229
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,759
um an issue for the um the provider here

230
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,280
but also for everybody that lives around

231
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,199
the power plant if hazardous gases are

232
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,080
leaked to the outside

233
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,199
now moses is going to talk us through

234
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,160
our ics-5 range please right

235
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,360
thanks

236
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,440
so how did we actually go about building

237
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,400
this ics firing range well let me maybe

238
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
first start with uh what we had in mind

239
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,319
what were our driving motivation uh

240
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,479
behind building this so as niko pointed

241
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,400
out we have a difference in security

242
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,319
requirements in ot

243
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,400
comparing to i.t right

244
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
and we then have to adapt those

245
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
differences obviously into our

246
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,599
approaches to performing security

247
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,958
assessments right

248
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,760
so

249
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,000
most importantly what we have to do to

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,159
pay attention to is of course the safety

251
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,559
aspect we can never know really what is

252
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,600
the safety impact of of hacking a ot

253
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,320
device if we don't have accurate

254
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,839
depictions of the documentation of what

255
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,920
actually those devices do

256
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
so what we want to do and what we then

257
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,320
succeeded to do is to build a

258
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
playground where we can

259
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,160
perform internal training

260
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
to then perform research and development

261
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,560
on this

262
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,839
so

263
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,720
we

264
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
developed the concept of a water

265
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,399
treatment plant which was comprised of

266
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,000
three

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,800
water filtration units and then

268
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,920
as

269
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
actuators pumping stations which pumped

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,080
water from one filtration unit to the

271
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,200
next one

272
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
and to back this up and to

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,160
represent a more or less realistic

274
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,320
environment that drives this we had also

275
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,800
scada and an enterprise network behind

276
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,040
this fully virtualized

277
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,519
so when we worked on this we were then

278
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,360
contacted by clients who said well we

279
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,880
really like what you're doing we would

280
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,279
like to have this for us as well

281
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,000
because we are actually operating

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
critical infrastructure and as part of

283
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,839
this they operated bridges escort

284
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,040
bridges

285
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,640
and they wanted to have this such a

286
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,399
playground for their own digital

287
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,360
forensics and incident response teams

288
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,959
to find out okay what happened

289
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,399
post-compromise

290
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,920
and this should be also a mobile

291
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,760
solution so they can

292
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,360
then do those trainings at different

293
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,800
sites

294
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,760
so we adapted our concept to

295
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
to do basketball bridges

296
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,399
and this was our very first concept

297
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,240
so here you can see it's basically an

298
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,399
aluminum frame on wheels

299
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,240
in the very top there you have a scale

300
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,640
model of basical bridges

301
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
then in the lower half there's a front

302
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,839
and a back side in the front side you

303
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,040
see rt equipment such as plc's power

304
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,279
distribution power supplies and the back

305
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,399
there the

306
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,000
the area that you can't really look into

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
because there are black panels there

308
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,320
should be the virtualization server

309
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,279
so

310
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,959
we were familiar with building virtual

311
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,160
environments

312
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,079
we were somewhat familiar with

313
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,399
assembling stuff but not very much with

314
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,480
3d printing and

315
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,720
they're just designing this this bridge

316
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,240
for example so that's what we started

317
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,600
with

318
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,920
you can see in the center there's our um

319
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,959
our c80 model of the bridge um you saw

320
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,880
there were two bridges right so the

321
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
other side is just a flip version

322
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,440
and we 3d printed those so

323
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
what i would like to point out here in

324
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,519
particular are the most prominent parts

325
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,240
so here you can see the bridge leaves

326
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,160
which are lower and grays there are

327
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
switches that are our sensors which

328
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,240
detect whether our bridge is now in a

329
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,320
fully opened or fully closed state and

330
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,079
of course we also have traffic lights

331
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,079
and a road barrier that goes up and down

332
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,160
and when all of this works it's synced

333
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,680
so that there's a process where the

334
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,519
bridge opens and then the traffic

335
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,279
barriers are down and the lights

336
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,720
indicate that no traffic should happen

337
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,519
here

338
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,200
and it should all hold and then they go

339
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,360
back down again the road barriers go up

340
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,959
again and then traffic should commands

341
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,160
there

342
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,720
as we said as part of our title we built

343
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,480
this in our kitchen this is my kitchen

344
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,640
and that's my oven actually much to the

345
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,800
dismay of my wife we did this in my

346
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,959
kitchen just to keep those prototyping

347
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,800
intervals very very short

348
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
so typically i would design a model in

349
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,399
the evening kick off the print this

350
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,560
would take hours and hours and hours and

351
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,920
sometime in the afternoon it would be

352
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,760
done on the next day and i could take it

353
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
out of the printer and try and assemble

354
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
it and see if it works or if i have to

355
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,480
adapt

356
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,160
anything about it

357
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,279
so

358
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,440
at that point we got a model but it

359
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,760
couldn't really do anything on its own

360
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,720
so we needed to do more to it we first

361
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,920
assembled it

362
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,480
then we got a hold of those aluminum

363
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,880
profile beams and built the frame and

364
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,959
the back plate for the electrocabinet

365
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,399
inside

366
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,240
we put all the ot equipment in there

367
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,560
wired everything together

368
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
installed the bridges and wired them

369
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,720
those are roughly 50 individual

370
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,839
connections

371
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,079
that we then put down to the to the ot

372
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,519
equipment

373
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,560
we put

374
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,800
panels to it because they look nice and

375
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,959
they of course

376
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,480
hinder you from actually reaching into

377
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,760
it while it's operating you shouldn't do

378
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,880
that

379
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,800
uh some sweet backlighting we put in

380
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,000
there so you could actually see

381
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,240
something because it was getting dark

382
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,480
and we did a lot of testing an awful lot

383
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
of testing many hours were put into

384
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,079
debugging all of this

385
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,760
and we at some point even had to recite

386
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,200
using an oscilloscope as you can see

387
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,000
here

388
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,760
to debug the motor control signals

389
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,519
because they were not really in sync and

390
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,000
they were off

391
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
so we had the physical build but this

392
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,920
only gets you so far what we were really

393
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,320
interested in was actually powering it

394
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,839
with a fully virtual environment in the

395
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,160
back right so let's get to the network

396
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,240
infrastructure that was then used for

397
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,160
example for kill chains

398
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
this should again be somewhat realistic

399
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,079
and should be extendable

400
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,760
so here's our network infrastructure

401
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,600
those are four networks

402
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
the networks in the dotted rectangle

403
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,760
they're mostly virtual while the ot

404
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,279
network down there is

405
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,800
mostly physical

406
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,880
let's go through all of those

407
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,839
they were implemented in an e6i server

408
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,000
and they all use opn sensors for

409
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,160
segmentation and segregation so just for

410
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,800
routing and for the firewalls

411
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,120
now let's let's see so in the enterprise

412
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,880
we had an enterprise network we had a

413
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,320
domain controller and a domain joint

414
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
office workstation which we heavily

415
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,839
abused for initial foothold in our kill

416
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:58,720
chains

417
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
so there would be for example the case

418
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,320
where we had a phishing mail and this

419
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,760
attachment of the phishing mail got

420
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,000
opened and then it was compromised

421
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
there was also a web ui that would allow

422
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,320
office workers to then have a look at

423
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,480
what the process is currently

424
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,079
like in the

425
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:14,839
at the

426
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,360
bridge uh then in the skydive network we

427
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,279
had an operator workstation which would

428
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,800
allow you to

429
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
more closely

430
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,000
monitor what's actually going on in the

431
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,519
process taking place

432
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,040
like what are the individual pieces of

433
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,399
the bridge doing

434
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,839
there was an historian which actually

435
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,519
grabbed production data and stored it in

436
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,519
a time series database and a jump post

437
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,839
to which we will get back later

438
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,480
the dmz honestly states uh very empty

439
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,160
for most of the time and still is we

440
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
plan to put a

441
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,040
windows update server maybe there but we

442
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,680
didn't and then in the ot

443
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,000
network we have of course all our rot

444
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,680
equipment so there are four plc's one

445
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,240
rather new model so there was an s7 1500

446
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,800
they were all siemens plc's

447
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,399
that was the area supervision that one

448
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,160
would orchestrate the other ones then

449
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,399
there are two more or less budget models

450
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,000
s7 1200s

451
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,920
they were the lifting substations and

452
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,839
they drove the leaves and the barriers

453
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,519
and then lastly we got a legency model

454
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,600
the s7 300

455
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,480
which is if i recall correctly close to

456
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,000
30 years old

457
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,959
and that drives actually the lights

458
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,399
and of course we have the manual

459
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,639
override hmi so where you can actually

460
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,760
tap and change stuff around physically

461
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,120
we also built in a cctv system using

462
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,839
raspberry pi's and pin pen tilt cameras

463
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
and here's one last uh virtualized

464
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,759
station so that's the engineering

465
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,199
workstation that will be used to

466
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,680
actually program the controllers and

467
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
that would also be

468
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,120
more or less the last step in our kill

469
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,279
chain where which we could compromise to

470
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,160
then

471
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,199
um if it effectively compromise the plcs

472
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,880
because this one could program those

473
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,560
right

474
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,519
so uh knowing about this let me show you

475
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,040
what it really looks like when we all

476
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,959
assembled it

477
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,160
let's see if the video works

478
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,240
ah nice okay

479
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,399
so uh here you see the model on top and

480
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,560
it will just start its cycle of lowering

481
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,959
the the barriers and here we can see in

482
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,800
the hmi that what you see on screen is

483
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,399
actually sync to what's going on in the

484
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,800
ridge model

485
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,240
so now for example they are raising

486
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
again

487
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,959
taking a look inside we can see a whole

488
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,600
bunch of wiring stepper motors

489
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,199
and actually

490
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,959
also active cooling

491
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,800
we had to do this a whole bunch

492
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,160
over the whole firing range because it

493
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,480
got really really hot

494
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,120
then there on the back you can see a

495
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,759
desktop case so that's our e6i server

496
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,759
there's a big switch and an ap for

497
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,560
wireless and easier debugging

498
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,000
and that's pretty much it and that's

499
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,440
what it does all the time and now at

500
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,519
that point we can go there and try and

501
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,160
compromise it

502
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,759
then we have some backup slides in case

503
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,360
the video wouldn't work you can skip

504
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,720
those

505
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,560
now for the lessons learned what did we

506
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,320
learn we learned a whole bunch

507
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,639
first of all regarding the ics lab setup

508
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,480
we learned that especially with the

509
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,079
hardware compatibilities and

510
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,760
dependencies that you've got

511
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,359
assembling such a fire range can get

512
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,799
somewhat complicated when you're not a

513
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,359
main expert we are not

514
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,199
ics engineers we are not mechanical

515
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,199
engineers so those were things that were

516
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,359
rather new to us

517
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,640
you have to take several things into

518
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
account right so power supply what kind

519
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,799
of power source do you need what kind of

520
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,439
protocols do those uh devices support

521
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,959
what kind of protocols are relevant to

522
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,440
your cases to your scenarios maybe

523
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,520
so this can get

524
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,320
this can be quite a bit uh then the the

525
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
software licenses are quite pricey we'll

526
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,000
get into this later

527
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,919
and a practical thing that we figured

528
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,919
out was that the stepper motors they

529
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,679
tended to overheat and that was actually

530
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,039
very bad

531
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,400
for 3d printing

532
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,320
again we didn't really do this prior to

533
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,240
this project so this was all new to us

534
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,480
we are not mechanical engineers so

535
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,160
especially the part with the bridge

536
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,600
leaves opening and closing this was

537
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
quite challenging for us to develop

538
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
to design and then to implement and to

539
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,880
make sure that it doesn't break because

540
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,559
it broke a whole lot

541
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,799
and then factor in the fact that

542
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,720
printing is very time consuming as i

543
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
said i would kick off a print um at

544
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,400
night and it would maybe be done in the

545
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
afternoon next day we had prints we had

546
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,640
individual parts that took up to three

547
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,559
days to print so 72 hours and if

548
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,280
anything goes wrong you're done it's bad

549
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,799
and also if you're not an expert in 3d

550
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,880
printing you will run into a whole lot

551
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,559
of problems

552
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,480
ranging from from a to z so we had for

553
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,840
example problems

554
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,039
with the prints not sticking to the

555
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,880
print bed so the print would just go and

556
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,559
the filament would go all over the place

557
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,919
but it wouldn't be there where you

558
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,760
actually needed it

559
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,200
and then to have

560
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,640
models that you can actually adapt to

561
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,280
your needs and to to modify further you

562
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,120
would do this in cad

563
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,520
again we didn't know cads prior to this

564
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,760
so this was also required a whole bunch

565
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,880
to learn

566
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,760
but also there were practical challenges

567
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,720
so

568
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,960
this is this is the firing range it was

569
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,760
80 centimeters by 120 centimeters in

570
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,240
size uh only the frame was in meter in

571
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,520
in in height

572
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,120
and if you factor in the wheels and the

573
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,880
models it's one it's more like one and a

574
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,039
half meters so every time we wanted to

575
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,280
move it anywhere we needed to get a very

576
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,640
very big van

577
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,320
which was mostly empty but we needed it

578
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,559
to put it there upright so we needed the

579
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,480
vertical space

580
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,160
and then also we had problems with the

581
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,559
models right so here you would see that

582
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,480
the road barrier would collide with the

583
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,160
lights up there

584
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,000
wasn't very nice the stepper motors were

585
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,160
heating up there was the wiring which

586
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
was all over the place

587
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,280
and there was very little clearance for

588
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,039
the moving parts

589
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,520
this was iteration one so we it one more

590
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,840
time and there iteration two we

591
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,000
addressed all of those problems here you

592
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,919
can see those lights are set back so

593
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,600
they don't collide anymore there are

594
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,360
actually fans that we built into it so

595
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,200
there's active cooling and you can just

596
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,880
let it run for hours now it won't every

597
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,559
heat which is nice

598
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,160
if you want to do maintenance or if you

599
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,840
have to do it there's a central back

600
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,080
plane where all the wiring is just going

601
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
which is nice and of course the

602
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,440
clearance we have way more clearance

603
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,480
here and then no more parts scraping on

604
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,440
other parts so that's great

605
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,440
what's the bottom line though uh we

606
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
started this in january 2021 we put more

607
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,760
than a thousand hours of manual work

608
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,720
into it

609
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,520
more than 900 hours additional to the

610
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,760
first 1000 hours which is net 3d

611
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,440
printing time and a whole lot of this

612
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
time was overnight

613
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,039
and over the course of the whole project

614
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,400
we burned through more than eight

615
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
kilograms of filament

616
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,559
we spent roughly eighteen hundred

617
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,280
eighteen thousand us dollars

618
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,799
on the whole project most of this for

619
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,720
hardware but as you can see three and a

620
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,039
half thousand euros are use dollars just

621
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,720
for licenses

622
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,880
which i hadn't expected

623
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,799
in the beginning but here we go

624
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,320
and we actually destroyed some stuff

625
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,520
over the course of the project so there

626
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,880
were two stepper motors that we actually

627
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,679
burned through one plc that died

628
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,240
presumably from 40 wiring

629
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,640
and one motor driver that also died due

630
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,520
to 40 wiring and at times we lost parts

631
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,240
of our sanity to be honest

632
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,840
at that point i would like to hand over

633
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,039
to nico again about what's next

634
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,640
what's next

635
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
thanks for it

636
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,039
okay um so you

637
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,880
if you paid attention i'm sure everybody

638
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,840
did

639
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,600
the video deferred the video that we

640
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,159
showed deferred from the 3d model for

641
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,240
example um so if it wasn't clear we we

642
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,679
actually created two iterations the

643
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,919
first one where the problems the rules

644
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,840
that that most mentioned and then to

645
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
make it better we created a second model

646
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,120
so that's actually two models what we

647
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,960
should be doing is creating a third

648
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,440
iteration um to address some of those

649
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,799
points that

650
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,640
are still not

651
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
not that great so for example mobility

652
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,120
is an issue you need still to rent a van

653
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,640
to transport it and it was supposed to

654
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,039
be very mobile it really isn't at this

655
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,039
moment um so it could be for example

656
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,080
that the disassembling of the entire um

657
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,120
firing range is somewhat easier um maybe

658
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,559
um yeah that parts could be taken out

659
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,799
of it um also the modularization is

660
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,400
something that we we had in mind for

661
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,840
example so we we talk about basket

662
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,360
bridges now but maybe we want to have a

663
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,960
small town or toy train or something

664
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,720
running on top without changing the

665
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,640
hardware underneath because it's most

666
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,320
likely going to be very similar so we

667
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,520
just um

668
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
would replace the the top on the model

669
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
i.e the bridges with something else and

670
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,360
then download new software on the plcs

671
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,640
and then it should be done so this is

672
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,320
something that that could be done in a

673
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,000
third iteration whether or not we're

674
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,799
doing this we have to see um

675
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,720
it's not clear at this moment what we

676
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,080
certainly will be doing is developing

677
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,240
scenarios so this the intention of this

678
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
firing range was to use it for training

679
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
and we've used it for forensics training

680
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
in ot for example so we had a two today

681
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
workshop on this which were quite great

682
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,159
um but we currently don't have scenarios

683
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,600
for example for penetration testing or

684
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
red teaming in ot so this is something

685
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,280
we want to to work on as well um

686
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,600
similarly uh monitoring and detection ot

687
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,799
i think is a topic that's very

688
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,240
interesting and

689
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,400
when many people are interested in

690
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,720
looking that as well even in our company

691
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
so for for this developing a scenario

692
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,120
would be very worthwhile

693
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,320
um now if if you're interested in ot or

694
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
want to know more about this project um

695
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,919
we're here to answer questions of course

696
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,440
we're going to be outside you know after

697
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,520
this talk you can reach us

698
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,760
via these email addresses um if you want

699
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,400
to know what nviso does for ics there's

700
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,880
a page for that as well and otherwise we

701
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
have two twitter handles and a blog that

702
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,679
you can look up on the block there is a

703
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,640
series um about this fire range as well

704
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,440
so

705
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
parts of what we presented a bit more

706
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,320
detail as well in some

707
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,200
in some areas and just check it out and

708
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,280
see for yourself

709
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,879
good any questions

710
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,840
thank you

711
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,360
thank you thank you

712
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,840
so do we have questions i'm sure for the

713
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,760
audience the front microphone if you

714
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,039
want to

715
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,440
take any questions

716
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,640
so

717
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,320
okay i see chen

718
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,960
please come up

719
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,480
it's hella cool so thank you very much

720
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,120
for this um i was wondering

721
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
what other materials did you consider

722
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,919
when putting this model together like

723
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,760
did you did you think about legos or

724
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,360
something like this or did you go

725
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,240
directly to printing

726
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,400
i think we lego was in talks there was

727
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,320
some talks about using a bit more wood

728
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,480
as well to to get some parts done i'm

729
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,640
not sure what we did not decide on lego

730
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,760
in the end

731
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,760
to be honest

732
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,039
not sure

733
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,279
i think it just looks cooler if it's 3d

734
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,600
printed maybe it was occupied by

735
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,520
children or something yeah as well yeah

736
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,799
i think the the probably the

737
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,960
possibilities are it's just a lot more

738
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
possibilities to

739
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,159
create stuff if we have a 3d printer

740
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,840
then we we're fully in control of how it

741
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,600
should look like and

742
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
especially the smaller parts than they

743
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,360
are needed

744
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,960
and i'm a long time no lego player but

745
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
i remember there were no real bridges

746
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,200
moving bridges so you only had trains

747
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,679
and stuff okay um do you have any um

748
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,240
similar projects like um

749
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
other companies doing similar test

750
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,960
ranges firing ranges that you exchanged

751
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,559
ideas with

752
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,400
honestly we no we didn't we know that um

753
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,159
not for bridges but but of course

754
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,760
siemens for example they they have

755
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,279
developed

756
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,000
um also test environments for

757
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,880
for traffic controls for example um but

758
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,640
but it's a different price range as well

759
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,240
and i'm not sure if they

760
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,679
they would disclose too much about their

761
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,440
projects towards us

762
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,880
um but no

763
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,600
actually don't know maybe over you find

764
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,360
somebody from siemens over a coffee yeah

765
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,960
um so do we have any other questions

766
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,919
right one coming up

767
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,960
uh so uh most of the ics or the ot

768
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,559
environment will have some physical

769
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,960
control uh over the process not only

770
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,799
that some malware can shut down the

771
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,880
process while building your fire range

772
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,039
did you also consider physical controls

773
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,120
like you detect some attack or something

774
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,799
and then there is

775
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,799
somebody who is putting out switch or

776
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,520
like why triton did not succeed and also

777
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,279
scenarios like that

778
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,919
so that's the hmi if you meant that so

779
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,840
that's the hmi for the control so for

780
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,400
example uh if you

781
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,120
consider the titan thing it tried to

782
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,559
shut down the safety system but of

783
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,480
course it did not succeed there were

784
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,559
also physical controls on site and all

785
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,919
to avoid this

786
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,159
were you considering this to build in

787
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,840
the firing range because that would be

788
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,480
more realistic in an ot or ics

789
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,120
environment right yeah

790
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,400
so

791
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,080
we can't put everything in that model

792
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
that's i think um probably that's

793
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,880
difficult um so we we um restrict

794
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,559
ourselves to the couple of plcs that we

795
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,840
have in the hmi um to and and with the

796
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,400
stars around that so additional hardware

797
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
equipment we did not plan for at least

798
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,520
in in these situations so far

799
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,360
yeah yeah this is why because it would

800
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,159
not be practical to imagine that okay

801
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,320
only through an enterprise network you

802
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,919
get into the ot network because there

803
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,240
would always be some physical control

804
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,640
over the processes as well sure so you

805
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,720
think that the the attacker like they so

806
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,159
they skip the it part and they go

807
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,320
straight to ot and and

808
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,520
uh

809
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,960
carry out the attack from this is that

810
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,480
no i meant like there would be some uh

811
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,640
physical control that

812
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,039
cannot be reached by attackers yeah

813
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,679
avoid such scenarios and maybe in these

814
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,360
kind of projects we can also consider

815
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,279
this it could be it could be implemented

816
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,120
in this show yeah i mean it's also

817
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,440
extendable if this is a project for the

818
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,039
future i think it's a good idea to

819
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,360
include thank you thanks

820
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,120
and are you going to put this on the

821
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,799
internet for us to test as well

822
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,279
i guess you need data

823
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,200
for forensic analysis

824
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,760
so you just just put it on the internet

825
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,000
and wait for us to test it maybe we

826
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,240
think about it

827
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,279
okay

828
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,480
okay thank you very much
