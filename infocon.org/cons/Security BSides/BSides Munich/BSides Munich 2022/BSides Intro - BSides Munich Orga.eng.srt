and thank you so much

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,360
for helping us and supporting us with

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,800
this community for security so here i

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
sneha your humble

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,160
uh host for today welcome you to besides

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,560
munich 2022

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,519
and i wish you all have a great day

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,000
today it's going to be fantastic and we

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,238
are going to make it super awesome

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,880
we have some ground rules today and the

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,960
very first ground rule is

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,440
you have to wear mask all the time this

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,239
is not just for your safety but it's for

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,640
everybody else's safety as well

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,600
so masks should be on because we are a

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,399
community and our idea our

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,399
responsibility is to make sure that

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,960
everybody in our community is safe and

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,399
sound

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,239
when we are talking about this community

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,199
we actually derive this entire meaning

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,960
and this actually goes with our

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,199
principles at b sites

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,920
besides security this is a group of

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,080
community of engineers security

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,880
researchers hackers individuals just

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,439
like you all

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,920
almost around 13 years ago

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,400
these individual ingenious people they

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,479
somehow couldn't make it to the

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,640
mainstream conferences

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,880
and they thought that no their voices

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,320
needs to be heard

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,479
and that's when they started a new

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,200
community called besides security and

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,840
today they are present all over the

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,360
world and we

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,720
are humbled to be a part of it besides

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,000

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,440
we are a small set of organizers we like

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,000
to call ourselves as the besides munich

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,440
team

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,040
we have incredible 20 sponsors who are

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,680
the backbone for the conference this

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120
year

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,599
and especially thanks to their support

62
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,000
we are all present here and we do have

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,319
some great stuff lined up throughout the

64
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,519
day

65
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,640
apart from that sorry we had this year

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,760
57 cfp proposals call for papers that

67
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,720
was like super amazing 57 papers well

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,319
there's one thing that i definitely need

69
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,920
to tell you there were actually 58

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,640
papers but there was this one paper

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,200
which was so super genius

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,680
none of us like i'm telling you very

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,239
frankly whoever is present in this room

74
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,720
no one of us was qualified to judge that

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,760
paper the title of the paper was

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,319
laura ipsum

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,959
that was fantastic and it was the huge

78
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,400
paragraph

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,120
so

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,040
unfortunately we did not select that

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,760
paper and hence we have 57 papers this

82
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,560
year

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,480
out of which we have 31 awesome speakers

ideas and some of them are also going to

89
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,159
share how they perform the research but

90
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,400
they failed but we'll let you know what

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,239

you should say something

206
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
if you find that there is something

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,599

ask something how do i progress in my

240
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,600
life in my career there was always this

241
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,240
question whom should i ask i've always

242
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,480
dreamt of having a community a group of

243
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,880
individual people who think alike like

244
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,000
me who support my ideas and there has

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,880
always been this question with me that

246
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
how do i get this information from

247
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,240
but to be true to tell you the truth i

248
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,959
was also intimidated like oh my god that

249
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,120
person's like super awesome

250
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,959
he or she they are at a great level how

251
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,120
do i go and ask them

252
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,760
i always took a step back from asking

253
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,200
that question and always in my mind i

254
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,320
thought that would there be someone who

255
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
would be willing to answer these

256
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,079
questions who would not laugh at my

257
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,800
silly questions and say that's okay i

258
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,720
have an answer for you

259
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,040
