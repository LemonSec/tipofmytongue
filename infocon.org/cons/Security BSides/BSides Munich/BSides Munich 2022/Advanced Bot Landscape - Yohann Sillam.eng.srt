1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,680
so hello everybody nice to meet you

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,480
my name is johann cinema as

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,080
jane said

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,280
i'm working for an improv company

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,279
uh and this talk is going to talk uh to

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,560
be about uh

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,039
advanced bot landscape

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,960
so before we start i give you a short

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,880
introduction about myself

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,000
so

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
secret researcher with four years of

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,720
experience in cyber security

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,399
i spent the major part of my time

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,960
analyzing malwares but more recently i

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,840
spent time on web application security i

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,440
try to understand the advanced particle

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,680
system try to see their behavior if

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,440
there are ways to detect them or even

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,760
block them

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,280
so this is the agenda of the session

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,680
today

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,360
first we will see together the advanced

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,199
bar ecosystem

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,280
then i will show you the internal

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,680
structure of an advanced bot

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,680
and lastly we'll see together a few

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,440
different techniques and the detection

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,319
that we can provide

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,799
so let's go

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,080
but before we start sorry

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
short definition of bots

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,960
bots are softwares that automate action

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,400
on the internet

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,560
um there could be good bots for example

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,640
the google googlebot that's cooling the

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,320
web in order to improve its search

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,600
engine result

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,000
and you have bad bots for example the

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,920
ones that are scanning

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,759
all in the internet in search of

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,759
vulnerable websites

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,119
the difference between the two is the

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,920
content of the server being reached by

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,640
the by those bots for example a bot

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
that's not respecting the robots.txt

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,200
file at the root of the website will

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,880
definitely not be a good bot

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,040
okay so the market of bad bots is huge

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,840
the market just talking about ticket

50
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
it was estimated to be roughly eight

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,320
billion dollars in 2017 and we can see

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,079
that the market of bots is growing

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,719
general uh web scrapper uh software

54
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,640
market was valuated to half a billion

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,119
dollar uh and this was like almost this

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,560
year

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,800
you have communities gathering uh

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
hundreds of thousands of people

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,760
exchanging advices about bots selling

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,840
bots buying bots

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,120
and there are many ones that i'm going

62
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,160
to show you

63
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,879
in this presentation so this is such a

64
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,560
huge market

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,480
that very efficient bots can be very

66
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,879
expensive here is the example of a bot

67
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,519
called the wrath aio

68
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,760
out of stock in its own website

69
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,640
and on the recent market you can find it

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
for no less than one thousand seven

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,480
hundred dollar

72
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,879
here aiok means all in one

73
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,760
that is this bot is able to uh to scalp

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,080
actually it's an advanced scoping bot to

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,120
all to two targets all sites

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,120
uh develop with the shopify framework

77
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
uh okay so now let's talk about about

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
traffic in term of numbers so i've been

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,239
spoiled a bit but it's completely okay

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,480
so

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,360
bad bot traffic was measured to be

82
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
roughly a quarter of all internet

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,159
traffic in 2020 where a good bot is only

84
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,040
representing 15 percent of it

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,599
and when we drill down into this

86
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,120
we can see that

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,680
more than half of it is the fact of

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,920
advanced bots so

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,440
what do we mean exactly by advanced bots

90
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
so have a few things in mind

91
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
the first one is a usage of headless

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,239
brother browser technology

93
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,400
this is a technology that enables the

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,200
rendering of web content almost the same

95
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,599
way as real browser will do an example

96
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,519
of such technology is selenium for

97
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,200
example

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,879
we have invented the rotation between

99
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,959
anonymous proxies most of the time there

100
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,400
will be a residential one because they

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,879
are harder to detect

102
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,640
and also advanced anti-detection

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
mechanisms for example the ability to

104
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,360
mimic

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,560
human behavior

106
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,200
during the solving of captcha

107
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,720
we'll see an example of that later

108
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,120
okay so what's the purpose of advanced

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,080
bots so they can be used for many things

110
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,959
including carding the fact of creating

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,279
checking uh stolen credit card numbers

112
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,279
found for example in dark web and test

113
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,358
it against e-commerce websites

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,120
credential stuffing

115
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,199
the fact of taking combo list of

116
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,360
username and passwords from the dark web

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,759
and check it against a large range of

118
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,759
websites in order to find at least one

119
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,360
match

120
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,880
scalping

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,960
the fact of purchasing automatically a

122
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,600
large amount of premium items from

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,919
websites in order to resell it later at

124
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,240
a higher price on result markets

125
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,080
so this damages the reputation of the

126
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,320
commerce website and also generate a

127
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,040
loss in the long term for the company

128
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,320
because

129
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,080
it destroys the strategy of premium

130
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,600
items and generate frustration for the

131
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
customer

132
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,040
denial of inventory

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,880
the fact of

134
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,880
for example making a website unusable

135
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,400
via the massive usage of dummy cards

136
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
and so on

137
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,400
so among all of those types of um about

138
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,240
activities scalping has become so

139
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,160
popular that noit has become a kind of a

140
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,120
sport

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
so this is a video taken from a youtube

142
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,919
channel called butting with burger

143
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,280
showing one guy

144
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
using two different bots advanced bots

145
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,479
actually in order to scalp

146
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,080
the premium release of one specific

147
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,840
company

148
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,680
so he's using on the left side about

149
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,080
called cyber io and on the right one red

150
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,759
set uh robot

151
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,039
so each of the land that you can see

152
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,080
it's pretty difficult to see i'm not

153
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,880
sure if you see it well uh is a

154
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,080
scalping task operation

155
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,360
and the their status is evolving

156
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,840
initially it's connecting to the website

157
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,280
then filling the form and

158
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,360
eventually solving the captcha and do

159
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,199
the purchase operation so what you can

160
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,600
see in the left at some point the lines

161
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,000
turn green which means that the full

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,240
flow from the connecting to the page

163
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
monitoring of the price and the solving

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,720
of the captcha was entirely successful

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,120
and on the right side you can see that

166
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,960
it stays black

167
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,800
at the last stage it's not possible to

168
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
read because it's too small but it says

169
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
px banner

170
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,039
this tells that the security vendor of

171
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,800
the website was able to detect this

172
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,600
traffic as uh non-legitimate and was

173
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
able to block it

174
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,720
so this video is roughly a year old

175
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,280
and this shows that

176
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,039
in real time the bypass of the security

177
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,199
vendor by advanced scalper actually

178
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,240
called cyberario

179
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,360
so i showed you this this uh gif in

180
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,680
order to show you that this is an actual

181
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
concern to be able to block this kind of

182
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,599
traffic plus this kind of advanced

183
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
softwares

184
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,199
okay

185
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,080
so

186
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,720
one of the challenges of this research

187
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,479
was to get access to the files of the

188
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,520
bots

189
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,639
because

190
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
very often bots were out of stock in

191
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,160
their own websites

192
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
and even sometimes on the recent market

193
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,840
they were not available

194
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,479
so at least for you

195
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,720
set sources that were very useful to me

196
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,039
in this investigation

197
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,199
so first you have general hacking forms

198
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,319
for example uh hack forums crack.io

199
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,520
node.2

200
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
fraudster cruise install.live all of

201
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,720
those

202
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,599
are hacking forms in general and

203
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,280
when you so you can search for a

204
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,440
specific tool or you can see a new tools

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,759
that are coming out you'll have one post

206
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,000
describing the tool and most of the time

207
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
eventually you'll have a link to an

208
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,680
archive that's stored either to unknown

209
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,639
files or make a file upload

210
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,919
you'll have of course to be careful

211
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,039
because those may give you a small gift

212
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,599
uh they may be also infected by malwares

213
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,759
so you should analyze it in a specific

214
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,240
environment

215
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,440
okay

216
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,039
so here

217
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,879
other kind of marketplaces that were

218
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,560
very useful

219
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,080
so as i said scalping has become

220
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,919
extremely popular now you have even

221
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,080
marketplaces that are dedicated for a

222
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,720
type of scalping oh okay for

223
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,919
example

224
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,400
ticket bots so ticket scalping or

225
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,520
sneaker scalping here

226
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,479
okay

227
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,840
sometimes

228
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
we were able to get access to the source

229
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,080
of a bot

230
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,560
in github it was the case of cyber io

231
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,400
for example or

232
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,560
behind misconfigured server we were able

233
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,719
to get access to the file of

234
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,640
one advanced bot called the kegel

235
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,360
okay so once using all of those

236
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,200
techniques we were able to gather

237
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,279
something like 40 advanced spots so only

238
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,360
advanced

239
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,440
we try to answer a few questions

240
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,920
what are the statistics

241
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,120
in terms of programming language the

242
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,920
term of headless brother technology

243
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,440
what's the internal structure of these

244
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,200
bots

245
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,640
and what are the efficient techniques

246
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,519
that they are using

247
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,120
so i'm going to show you this now

248
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,200
so

249
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,160
uh

250
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
the great majority of them were

251
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,800
developed either with electron framework

252
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,080
or even sometimes with a dot net

253
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,560
written with dot net framework

254
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,720
and when we uh drill down and see uh

255
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,080
what's the headless browser technology

256
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
behind

257
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,640
we can see that puppeteer is the most

258
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,480
common headless browser technology used

259
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
here

260
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,560
but we can see also other ones selenium

261
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
is very popular.net browser but we have

262
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,560
also other ones like essential objects

263
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,880
jigs browser which is uh for java

264
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,920
playwright etc

265
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,720
now let's look at the internet structure

266
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,800
of an advanced bots so of course there

267
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,080
are many different bots so it's not

268
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
possible to do it for all of them but

269
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,839
the idea is to take the ones that are

270
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,080
the most successful so we go on discord

271
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,760
channel we try to see which bot are the

272
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,480
most expensive the most recommended and

273
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,080
because

274
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,959
often attackers

275
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,240
break uh their outcome um on those

276
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,519
challenges say that they were able to

277
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,200
escape this and this prominent release

278
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
so i decided to pick a bot called the

279
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
project destroyer

280
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,399
so a bit more than a year ago it was

281
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,760
worth one thousand dollar

282
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,440
it has the ability to scalp all of those

283
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
kind of websites that you can see here

284
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,320
and the reason i pick it is because it

285
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,399
has many functionalities so most of the

286
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,000
evision tricks that i will show at the

287
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
last part of the presentation are part

288
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,480
of

289
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
this bot

290
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,760
but in general the idea of bots are the

291
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,440
same be able to connect to website

292
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,959
without being fingerprinted be able to

293
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,800
perform automated actions in a

294
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,640
simultaneous way

295
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,760
at a very fast pace

296
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,160
so um we could split this is a very

297
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
simple version of this uh of this bot so

298
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
we could split uh in the left side

299
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,440
what's

300
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
the input what to provide with this bot

301
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
and on the right side what is inside of

302
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,760
the bot

303
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,880
so

304
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
to be provided to the bot a list of

305
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,600
proxies so usually ipport username and

306
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,839
password

307
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,440
a valid key for a captcha solving

308
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,640
service

309
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,880
for example capmanster a list of

310
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
profiles so including billing

311
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,600
information names addresses etc the

312
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,560
attacker may have several ones

313
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,480
and then inside of the bots

314
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,640
you have the headless browser so in this

315
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,880
case it was a puppeteer

316
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,120
um

317
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,480
usually you'll have also additional

318
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,200
modules that will improve its uh

319
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,880
ability not to be detected for example

320
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,399
in this case the puppeteer extra plug-in

321
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,560
staff

322
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,560
then you have an evasion module

323
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,240
that would be responsible for all of the

324
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,399
tricks to

325
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,519
uh to to make the bot hard to detect

326
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,320
you have a profile management module

327
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,079
that's responsible for storing the

328
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,160
profile provided by the attacker proxy

329
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,000
management module that will be

330
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,399
responsible to store the proxies check

331
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,560
if they are valid measure the speed and

332
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,399
solve them according to according to it

333
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,240
you have a cookie jar so it's an

334
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
interface provided to the

335
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
to the attacker

336
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,839
to generate valid cookies for the target

337
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,839
website so most of the time

338
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,040
uh 24 hours up to 48 hours before the

339
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
release of primary items the attacker

340
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
will have to generate a batch of cookies

341
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
and then they will be consumed during

342
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,079
the scalping operations

343
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,760
you have a capture management module

344
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,839
that will be responsible for extracting

345
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,000
the captcha from the page

346
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,800
send it to the third-party service

347
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,120
and then retrieve the answer and solve

348
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,760
it in the client side

349
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,560
and you have the operation module

350
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
so in the operation module most of the

351
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,880
time you have one folder for each target

352
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,720
victim that you have for example in the

353
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,959
case of project destroyer you have 37

354
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,839
folders

355
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,000
so it will contain the script in order

356
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,720
to click on specific button to

357
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,560
to fill a form etc

358
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
and then to call the other

359
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,040
components

360
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,800
okay so let's zoom in and see what

361
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,440
happens in uh one specific task so the

362
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,880
headless browser

363
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,000
here puppeteer is started

364
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
with with as i said a feature in order

365
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,680
to make it harder to detect for example

366
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,480
set

367
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,200
the webdriver to false

368
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,160
then

369
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,399
the bot will craft plausible device

370
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,880
attributes for the bot to look like

371
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
a real device i will show

372
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,519
some examples just later

373
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,920
then the bot will pick projected cookies

374
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,680
and proxy for the

375
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
specific target

376
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
then the bot will monitor the price uh

377
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,279
of the premium item that it wants to

378
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,600
purchase in a loop if at some point the

379
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
price is below the threshold that is set

380
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,760
by the attacker in the task then the

381
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,839
purchase operation will happen

382
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,000
when the captcha is provided to the to

383
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,519
the bot it will be sent to the third

384
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,760
party and the captcha will be solved

385
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,399
okay

386
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,920
so now let's look at a few efficient

387
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,279
techniques and some detections that we

388
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,839
can provide

389
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,399
first of all uh it's not actually uh

390
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,880
evasion it's a code protection so the

391
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,720
code of this bot was quite strongly

392
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,199
affiscated

393
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,680
when you try to expand it this way and

394
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
execute it you will crash with this

395
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,360
specific error

396
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,639
so

397
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,880
what actually the code does it checks

398
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,720
the difference of string representation

399
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,399
of functions when the code

400
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,839
is

401
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,440
not non-touch and when the code is being

402
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,920
debugged

403
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,279
so i had to understand which part of the

404
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,959
code was responsible for this check

405
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,560
disable it

406
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,800
and then i was able to detect the other

407
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,320
tricks used by the bot that i'm going to

408
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,079
show you now

409
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:48,880
so

410
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,120
one of the tricks that they used was to

411
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,000
add non-mandatory http address to the

412
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
fields of the requests

413
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,639
so here for example you have a list of

414
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,160
uh

415
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,680
seven different fields that are

416
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,279
non-mandatory http header fields

417
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
and uh there are

418
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,279
randomly a certain number of those

419
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,519
fields are added to the request that

420
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,600
will be sent for one specific scalping

421
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,639
task

422
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,279
so this is done in order to make uh the

423
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,880
bot looks like a slightly different

424
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
device each time it's performing a

425
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,959
scalping operation

426
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,199
so this is not actually javascript code

427
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,199
i geofascial data and show it in like

428
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,839
pseudocode

429
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,880
okay

430
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,959
another small trick that's worth

431
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,000
mentioning

432
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,399
it's called the address jigging

433
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,920
so

434
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,079
the bot is extracting the addresses

435
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,920
provided by the attacker

436
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,199
and then it's parsing it and uh finding

437
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,560
the keywords associated to roads avenues

438
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,959
lanes streets etc and then slightly

439
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,959
modifying it in order for all of the

440
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,320
scoping tasks even though they are

441
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,480
directing to the same address eventually

442
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,440
to look

443
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,279
different

444
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,160
for any uh security device that we try

445
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,720
to find scalping operations

446
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,160
for example there is another function

447
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,120
that will

448
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,079
add a leading zero before the numbers of

449
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,719
the addresses

450
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,199
okay

451
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,720
another important

452
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,680
topic that can be discussed related to

453
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,399
advanced bots is the ability to to stack

454
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,800
capture solving services for example

455
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
there is a tool a new tool called aycd

456
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
autosol

457
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
that can be integrated with some

458
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,199
advanced bot including cyberio for

459
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,399
example

460
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,600
that any

461
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,399
uh the attacker to uh to prioritize

462
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,920
different uh

463
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,000
skeptics solving service for example

464
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,759
first the capture will be sent to a cap

465
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,680
monster and if the captcha cannot be

466
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
sold by this specific service it will

467
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,680
jump to the next one and so on this

468
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,920
maximize the probability that eventually

469
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,959
the

470
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,719
scalping operation will be successful

471
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,399
okay so now let's look at a few

472
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,680
detections

473
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,560
that we can provide for this bot

474
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,720
so instead of the code i was able to

475
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,559
spot this specific section that's

476
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,079
responsible for

477
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,199
crafting

478
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,599
device attributes plausible

479
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,919
for for the bots so here you see the

480
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,319
available hath

481
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,799
so this is supposed to uh represent the

482
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,720
size of the screen of the device not the

483
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,640
size of the window and it's said to be

484
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,919
random number between 1000 and 1600

485
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,119
pixels

486
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,160
uh but it's like uniformly randomized so

487
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,440
there are values here that don't

488
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,280
correspond to any device on the planet

489
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,400
most likely

490
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,080
uh because it's uh

491
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
really precise so if someone really is

492
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
really paying attention to what happens

493
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
on the specific device uh he will be

494
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,240
able to detect that this is probably not

495
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,760
a real device but

496
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,039
about

497
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,200
so this is a flow in the in the code of

498
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,919
the of the bot

499
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,240
as i say here in the documentation this

500
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,039
is the size of the of the screen

501
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,240
okay another thing that we can do is

502
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,640
extract the snippet of code responsible

503
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,520
for

504
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,679
the solving of captcha in the client

505
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,559
side

506
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,679
so

507
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,160
eventually the bot is using a function

508
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,640
that will generate a busy curve in order

509
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,960
to solve the captcha so this is more or

510
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,440
less how it will look look like

511
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,559
so

512
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,240
you can see the curvature is pretty

513
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,679
smartly done you can see the

514
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,840
acceleration the deceleration so a

515
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,160
simple device will not be able to detect

516
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,799
this as illegitimate but if you pay more

517
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,320
attention you can see that a real human

518
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,000
will not draw curves like this it will

519
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,039
be more irregular so we try to just to

520
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,799
to to check if it was actually true if

521
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,039
we were able to to see a difference

522
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,039
between

523
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,679
uh real traffic can fake traffic

524
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,280
so to do so

525
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,640
uh we decided to measure the

526
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,440
acceleration of the curve

527
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,240
so

528
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,320
this is the graph that we obtained we

529
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,440
can see that the average is set to open

530
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,480
one pixel per millimeter square

531
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,720
with a maximum value to roughly open 15.

532
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,160
so we try to do the same with a human

533
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,120
curves

534
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,400
and this is more or less the graph that

535
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,160
we obtained with the average higher up

536
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,280
to open 15 and a maximum to open five so

537
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
the question here is not if we can

538
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,280
detect bots using this kind of technique

539
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,640
this bot actually using this kind of

540
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,880
tething is how much time do we need in

541
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,039
order to be accurate enough to be sure

542
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,039
that this is indeed

543
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,360
a bot

544
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,640
okay so as a conclusion

545
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,880
the managers of market bots

546
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,120
is a large and

547
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,360
expanding today

548
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,799
then there is a predominance of electron

549
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,120
framework for about development and the

550
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,559
puppeteer as a headless browser

551
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,360
technology and lastly it's a cat and

552
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,799
mouse game which means that um knowing

553
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,720
the code of the opponent being able to

554
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,400
understand the tricks that he's using is

555
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,640
a great advantage in order to help the

556
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,600
detection

557
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
for the detection of those of those

558
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,919
tools

559
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,060
uh that's it are there any questions

560
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:16,000
[Applause]

561
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,480
so do we have any questions for johan

562
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,840
and the bad bots

563
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,320
silence

564
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,039
um i actually have a question about

565
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,960
the one of your slides could you go back

566
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,000
to the slide where you had the

567
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,280
captcha

568
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,760
services the captcha beating services or

569
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,320
whatever they were there was a list

570
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,360
list

571
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,360
yeah

572
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
uh

573
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,679
this okay yeah this this one

574
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,240
so um i'm looking at them and there are

575
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,840
three there and on the right hand side

576
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,679
there is balance

577
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,200
0 49 984 do

578
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,679
what is the balance for

579
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,120
so

580
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,120
the attacker has to register for each of

581
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,280
the services that we he will integrate

582
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,120
with aosdio to solve

583
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,360
so

584
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,039
he'll have to pay for each of those

585
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,640
services and then each time they are

586
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,280
requested then the balance will

587
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,960
will decrease

588
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,799
so when the balance is set to zero so

589
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,240
you cannot use this service so probably

590
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
it will skip automatically to the next

591
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,360
one

592
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,080
uh-huh okay so then do these services

593
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,400
cost different like per time of use is

594
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,080
there a different price between the

595
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,760
different services or are they roughly

596
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,039
the same

597
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,440
um so the prices um

598
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,880
uh uh

599
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,240
um

600
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,000
roughly the same they can like they can

601
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,720
vary uh a bit but more or less it's uh

602
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,200
it's uh something like open one dollar

603
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,440
for uh for each request something like

604
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,159
that

605
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,039
okay

606
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,280
interesting

607
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,039
and then

608
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,919
you talked a lot about scalping um in

609
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,480
your presentation and

610
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,120
to me uh i'm very old-fashioned scalping

611
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,559
to me is where i go to a concert and

612
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,320
there's somebody standing outside

613
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,799
holding tickets up and saying please buy

614
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,039
my tickets and the concert is sold out

615
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,280
and i pay a bunch of money for that

616
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,240
what does scalping mean in sort of this

617
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,919
realm in the in the bot world

618
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,640
so

619
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,799
i said that scalping is uh

620
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,679
um okay it damages the so first it's

621
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,360
something that's uh

622
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,440
uh almost everywhere in the market of

623
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
bots and actually this is where the most

624
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,400
advanced but we can find the most

625
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,960
advanced bots because um

626
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,799
they need to have a very strong

627
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,480
interaction with the website it's not

628
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,720
only about like sending one request it

629
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,320
needs to keep a communication be able to

630
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,240
move from page to page without being

631
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,480
spotted as a malicious bots

632
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,120
so as i said uh scalping damages the

633
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,760
reputation of uh companies when they're

634
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,840
successfully uh

635
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,919
and that's why companies really try to

636
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:56,960
invest

637
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,400
in order to be able to protect again

638
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,600
those threats

639
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,280
so this is why

640
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,440
this presentation is

641
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,200
like slightly oriented with a scalping

642
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,840
but let's say

643
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,240
okay and then what is the target then of

644
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,400
a bot that's in that is engaging in

645
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,679
sculpting

646
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,600
what's the target yeah what what is that

647
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,240
um so there are many targets so i show a

648
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
few of them so for example uh website

649
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,080
developed with shopify from works but

650
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
there are amazon of course ebay

651
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,799
walmart

652
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,000
adidas also i mean

653
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
if you go to any of the markets that was

654
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,640
listed above you can see the list for

655
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,679
each of the birds that you want to

656
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,559
purchase

657
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,280
you will see the list of targets that it

658
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,200
has the ability to um

659
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,440
to to attack okay

660
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,520
i think we have another question up here

661
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,840
yeah um

662
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,360
yeah thanks for your

663
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,320
talk and i got a question about bot

664
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,240
protection i work on a software as a

665
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,919
service product which is very very

666
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,760
attractive for

667
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,679
people who are trying

668
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,960
logins from

669
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,400
database leaks

670
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
and um for us the invisible recapture

671
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,279
from google was the only solution

672
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,000
to protect our hololog in

673
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,720
against bots

674
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,320
and automated attacks

675
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,039
do you know how safe they are

676
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,000
like a recapture i think it's a top of

677
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
the notch or one of the top of the knot

678
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,120
solutions

679
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,000
but

680
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,559
do you have any experience

681
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,679
um so recaptcha is relatively strong but

682
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,240
of course i mean they are always the the

683
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,760
machine learning tools that are

684
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,039
currently used

685
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,159
by uh third-party capture services are

686
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,559
stronger and stronger even at some point

687
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,960
what they do is they just automatically

688
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,799
send it to a specific person that will

689
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,640
solve it manually so this is i think the

690
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,320
case you have like a tool called death

691
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,640
capture that's doing both of it it's uh

692
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,320
so if the captcha is simple it solve it

693
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
with machine learning if not it sends it

694
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,720
sends it to uh to someone usually in

695
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,039
india that will uh

696
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,880
that will solve it so it's a it's an

697
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,440
ongoing challenge to be able to um to uh

698
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,720
to

699
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,279
improve uh uh capture strength

700
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,520
um

701
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,600
but there are many different ways to try

702
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,120
to detect but not only about like

703
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,640
capture this is like the the end

704
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,760
solution that

705
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,440
actually companies now are trying to

706
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
avoid because it's time consuming also

707
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,320
for the consumer it's bad user

708
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,760
experience

709
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,760
thanks

710
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,640
hi uh you talked about uh randomizing or

711
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,080
pseudo uh

712
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,279
minimizing the shipping address for

713
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,200
some scalpel that is trying to buy all

714
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,760
the sneakers on the market or whatever

715
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,640
um

716
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,240
has anyone tried

717
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,760
talking to the shipping guys of ups and

718
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,159
stuff like that because it sounds like

719
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,840
an integration with those guys can

720
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,279
provide a feedback loop to actually

721
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,039
detect them

722
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,039
um so this is an

723
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,559
interesting topic

724
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,760
i don't think that's okay so it's

725
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,080
probably below i don't think that uh

726
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,799
this is something that we did

727
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,720
indeed this is uh this is something that

728
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,880
can be done but i mean i assume that

729
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,360
people are uh sometimes

730
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,600
writing shortcuts for also addresses so

731
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,080
uh it may lead to false positive um

732
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,600
uh one option probably would be in the

733
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,840
logs of the um so propose a service for

734
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,000
the website to to aggregate the logs and

735
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,559
check if there are any uh

736
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,159
um aggregation that can lead to

737
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,159
detection of scalping operations this is

738
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,520
can something that can be done

739
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,919
eventually more at the level of the

740
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:36,840
log

741
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,000
analysis okay thanks

742
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,399
do we have any other questions for johan

743
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,640
all right we're okay go for it

744
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,080
uh hi so um

745
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
with this technique let's say uh

746
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,400
professional sculptors are to say

747
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,880
what quantity of product might this

748
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,480
person be looking at and then how

749
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,360
this person actually gets then

750
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,320
things

751
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,440
um

752
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,039
what's the quantity sometimes it can go

753
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,600
up to 50 different box of

754
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
let's say sneakers that cost each of

755
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,399
them 100 or even i don't know a bit more

756
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,120
so it can be sold at much higher price

757
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,279
so you can see in mark wrestle markets

758
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,200
for specific brands

759
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,880
the prices of items can go up to a

760
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,799
thousand dollar so when you have 50

761
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,039
bucks so you multiply the two numbers

762
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,520
you can you can make like um

763
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,840
a very large amount of money so

764
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,600
this also explains the price of the bot

765
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,520
that i showed you brady io uh two

766
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
thousand dollar this is an investment

767
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,080
but eventually um sometime it pays off

768
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
all right we are getting to the end of

769
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,679
our time so please give johan a round of

770
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,880
applause for bad boss
