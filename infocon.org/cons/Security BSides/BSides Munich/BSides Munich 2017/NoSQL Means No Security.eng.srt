1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:09,120
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started um yeah I I think</font>

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,969
besides Vienna and that is always<font color="#E5E5E5"> an end</font>

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,518
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> year like last two editions already</font>

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,810
um and yeah I'm from Vienna I always

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:28,310
describes Vienna like the city of come

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:28,310
on no no yes to be armed Teddy foods

7
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:46,709
know what is up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you ethical</font>

8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:48,630
architecture and classical<font color="#CCCCCC"> music yeah</font>

9
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,220
but it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only way how we can win</font>

10
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:55,620
anything around dizzy anymore so I work

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:59,220
for elastic the company behind left

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,890
research classic stack and I'm part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,260
the infrastructure team so internal

14
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:06,090
cooling AWS docker containers all these

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,130
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I always say and this is</font>

16
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,619
a unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> type I kind of pipe that into</font>

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,719
developer advocacy so I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

18
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,060
conferences if you have any questions

19
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,119
articles on come to me quickly because I

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,159
need to head to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russia in the afternoon</font>

21
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and yeah and I was running so meters in</font>

22
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,579
Vienna what about databases and what

23
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,100
about the various inside of soft light

24
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:33,538
papers do you have a papist<font color="#E5E5E5"> Munich</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> group</font>

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,359
there between the Munich it's kind of a

26
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:38,189
worldwide thing you you read an academic

27
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:39,509
paper each month and then you just

28
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,839
discussed it like the new study group

29
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,799
and what you hated<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at university you</font>

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,539
kind of do it voluntarily now and yeah

31
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:54,299
so I guess everybody knows that one

32
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:56,609
little Bobby tables so no sequence not

33
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,959
on the SQL where you generally don't

34
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:04,679
have as you can without SQL no SQL

35
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,240
injections right problem solved who

36
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:08,130
thinks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of true like there</font>

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,440
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way square I obviously know SQL</font>

38
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:16,109
injections<font color="#CCCCCC"> with no injections energy</font>

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:19,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">people is anybody ok I will see arm</font>

40
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,590
so let's talk about manga<font color="#CCCCCC"> DB because its</font>

41
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,470
most widely used one and because those

42
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,630
are web scale maybe if people still

43
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,250
remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in the heydays of no</font>

44
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,140
sequel like there was this comic we're

45
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,810
making fun of mommy to be like oh you

46
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,570
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it because its web scale and</font>

47
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,340
throw away<font color="#CCCCCC"> your SQL database yeah stuff</font>

48
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,620
has changed since then but still most

49
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,070
widely used and let's see how it goes

50
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">there so X K injections are probably not</font>

51
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,630
since there is no SQL but you can do

52
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,280
stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody still</font>

53
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:55,049
remembers diaspora that was the sex lots

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,670
of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago that the Facebook killer or</font>

55
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,440
whatever the decentralized social

56
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">network stuffed with garlic billion</font>

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,150
dollars venture capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think and then</font>

58
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,760
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever got out of it but if you're</font>

59
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,880
interesting to fuji articles for example

60
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,329
is they I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was Ruby and they had</font>

61
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,609
stuff like that so they have defined

62
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,320
dollar where where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of define a</font>

63
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,070
condition for<font color="#E5E5E5"> more gdb and then they</font>

64
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,720
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> throw a string against it and while</font>

65
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,170
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an Afghan injection obviously</font>

66
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,930
that is a script injection whatever you

67
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,488
put in there you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just yeah close</font>

68
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,830
whatever you're doing and run some other

69
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,350
arbitrary script there so don't do that

70
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,350
that was found<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Astro script they</font>

71
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,230
got rid of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that eventually but it didn't</font>

72
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them they didn't really make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

73
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff you should watch out for if you</font>

74
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:49,019
rise mommy-to-be queries for example is

75
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,180
these a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BB evil kind of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious one</font>

76
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,310
but the others as well like if you run

77
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,230
any of these and you pop in some strings

78
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,230
you just do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the string</font>

79
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,510
concatenation we promptly have injection

80
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,250
problems or you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have them because</font>

81
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:07,048
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's just running some random script</font>

82
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:09,360
don't just take that and sanitized you

83
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,890
can turn off scripting and I don't

84
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,510
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why it's an able because</font>

85
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,720
it's normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad performance</font>

86
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,159
wise and security wise not great either

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,440
but yeah you can either pass it as a

88
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,200
parameter to the momma Dee process or

89
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,690
you can just a blip in the script in the

90
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,450
conflict or you can if they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

91
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,940
weird code w scope<font color="#CCCCCC"> blocks like you can</font>

92
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,159
put script into that and

93
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,930
we properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> escaped I've never tried</font>

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but normally it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seems</font>

95
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,900
scripting any database like why would

96
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:42,740
you even have stripping images and and

97
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:45,049
then we had something<font color="#E5E5E5"> from solid 2015</font>

98
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,180
when they just can't the internet for

99
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,970
open MongoDB database simply followed

100
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,360
quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them and as it often</font>

101
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:56,210
happens like academia is first and then

102
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,630
it takes some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to actually get out</font>

103
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the real world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in probably</font>

104
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">January this year it was pretty much</font>

105
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:08,150
that's far when people's<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarded</font>

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:11,240
ransomware attacks of business doors so

107
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,450
they would hopefully backup the data

108
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,300
somewhere then heat it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and leave a note</font>

109
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,940
on page pairs that amount of money and

110
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,680
you will get your data back so from<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

111
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">i heard sometimes they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

112
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,550
take the backups and they will just

113
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">delete your data and leave the message</font>

114
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:31,400
and yeah if you pay your you're not

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting your database um but that's just</font>

116
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:39,830
accidental so that is not what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

117
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:44,289
um quick show of hands who thinks that

118
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">mom will be only binds to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> localhost</font>

119
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:51,140
nobody but they do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can recent</font>

120
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,810
versions like I think they changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

121
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,490
two or three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahsoka</font>

122
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">demek was learning experience before</font>

123
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,750
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> bounced going interfaces just be</font>

124
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,210
easy to get started<font color="#E5E5E5"> but for two or three</font>

125
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,760
years they have been binding just

126
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,140
localhost by default so anybody who can

127
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,820
be attacked over the internet actually

128
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:12,229
change that setting sun at some point

129
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:15,830
who thinks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> authentication</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbors</font>

130
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:19,730
by default unfortunately that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the</font>

131
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:22,280
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there are the protection is they</font>

132
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,750
will find just to read localhost and if

133
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,309
you change that you're supposed to

134
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,810
change the authentication as well and

135
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,790
and obviously nobody does it so let's

136
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,110
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do they even have to even have</font>

137
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,500
something like authentication

138
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,900
authorization um yes but you need to

139
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,840
enable it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all true witches love</font>

140
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,568
that hard they had one implementation

141
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">preview</font>

142
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:48,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">p which was the challenge sports movie</font>

143
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:51,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">thingy and in more recent versions they</font>

144
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:54,419
have a new implementation called Graham

145
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,749
shell<font color="#E5E5E5"> one which seems like just from</font>

146
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:00,419
looking at it very solid using an

147
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:03,089
official standard and they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> added some</font>

148
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:06,599
nice features so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have stuff like you</font>

149
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:10,649
can define the iteration count for

150
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:13,438
hashing you have a salt per user now and

151
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:18,059
not only per server anymore they had

152
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:20,009
finally gotten rid of md5 and also the

153
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:22,080
server authenticate against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clients</font>

154
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:25,229
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look only the other way around so</font>

155
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,419
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> promising you just need</font>

156
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:29,580
to use it and just to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

157
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:32,729
unfortunately it's a bit of it and dance

158
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,258
around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system to get it started so</font>

159
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,110
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the predefined both there are</font>

160
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:40,409
lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> of roles you can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use them you</font>

161
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,809
can create your own this maybe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

162
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:45,300
many because it's a bit confusing ah but

163
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:47,610
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you enable them so normally what</font>

164
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,459
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do is you start your process</font>

165
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,319
with the north / so you can log in for

166
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,169
the first time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of pretty much</font>

167
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,439
as people<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameters and then you can</font>

168
00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:00,959
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm creating a user fill your</font>

169
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">passwords and I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the role route on</font>

170
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,069
the MU database and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you exit it so</font>

171
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,599
first you create user and you exit it

172
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,519
then we started a tab it again that's

173
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,529
the first line and instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> North</font>

174
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,019
we're just saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> all so we're all Senta</font>

175
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:18,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">cating against it now if I then just do</font>

176
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:20,399
the Mongoose or Moody's always the

177
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:22,499
server process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mongo is the client</font>

178
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,259
process so if i use mumbles local admin

179
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:27,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm trying to collect i connect us to</font>

180
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:31,259
the moment be processed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> local o</font>

181
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:34,438
people caught us yet in database if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

182
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,339
run any man live show db's it will throw

183
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:36,809
me an error because you're not

184
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,729
authenticated now you really need

185
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,098
authentication so we're trying again

186
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,439
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm actually providing my</font>

187
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:47,310
user it will ask interactively from a

188
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:48,689
password<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then i can create another</font>

189
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,500
non admin user

190
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,750
who can repurpose it and write every to

191
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,130
therapy and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can leave that again</font>

192
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,230
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

193
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,120
real admin user for anything because as

194
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:06,950
soon as somebody gets that you're done

195
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,950
again so then L is authenticated and

196
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:20,190
with this line work here what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have in</font>

197
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:25,500
here any guesses so we have said read on

198
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:27,630
pet a and<font color="#E5E5E5"> reprise on Pepe so that is so</font>

199
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:32,520
we're connecting to test a you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

200
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try something that we fail then we're</font>

201
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,860
switching<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device here will work then</font>

202
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,620
we're switching to the database in an

203
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,780
example yes we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> write we can read</font>

204
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,340
then we're switching to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seagate can</font>

205
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:49,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">I even switch you to see database do you</font>

206
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:52,920
think yes but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can unfortunately</font>

207
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,810
replacement that makes scripting pretty

208
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,800
difficult because you can't switch to a

209
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,079
database but you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

210
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,949
permissions on it and so here will only

211
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,320
happen here if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> define so yeah but</font>

212
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,530
that is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dance you need to do</font>

213
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,970
to create the root user and to create

214
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,430
dedicate user for whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

215
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:16,110
do and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a secure</font>

216
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:19,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">fashion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ssl as far as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know it's silly</font>

217
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,420
commercial but the commercial part is

218
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,950
only like the binaries don't contain in

219
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,990
it but the source code does so if you

220
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,400
compile this device other source code

221
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,840
yourself you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a self support</font>

222
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,720
yeah everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to make money</font>

223
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:37,680
somewhere I fight it with decision but

224
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:41,670
yeah anyway continuing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> readies</font>

225
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,300
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> using ready it's so simple and</font>

226
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:47,969
nice right and it has some very unique

227
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,839
security features do you think defines

228
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:57,270
to all interfaces who thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet who</font>

229
00:10:51,839 --> 00:11:01,380
thinks no so it does but with a little

230
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,910
trick um since a pretty recent version

231
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,410
like yes

232
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,350
year ago they added something called

233
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:09,079
protected mode so it will bind to all

234
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,690
interfaces but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will only respond to</font>

235
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,480
queries are unlocking doors with the

236
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,820
actual result and for remote viewers it

237
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,410
will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw a message like oh you're</font>

238
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,990
not properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> authenticated and your</font>

239
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,850
remote system<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fix that so it's not</font>

240
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,470
not working but it's not working

241
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,120
correctly either it's just showing you

242
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,490
what you need to do which I find

243
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,440
actually in can kind of a user friendly

244
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,120
approach is not just blocking you but it

245
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,600
will tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you need to change</font>

246
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:39,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work but by default if we bind</font>

247
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,690
to all interfaces and yet they have

248
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,510
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like authentication but there</font>

249
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:48,860
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no authorization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or like pretty</font>

250
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:50,689
binary yes-or-no<font color="#E5E5E5"> X's and even in their</font>

251
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,320
documentation they call it a tiny layer

252
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:58,070
of authentication which I find very nice

253
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,340
coat like so tiny because nearly doesn't

254
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:04,310
exist so what you can do is you can say

255
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:08,300
all password if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have set a password</font>

256
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:12,739
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready configuration file</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

257
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:14,900
you can run your command problem is the

258
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,630
password is stored in plain text in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

259
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,069
reddit com I think it's also transmitted

260
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">plain text</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there is no ssl</font>

261
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:24,200
encryption or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> by people and</font>

262
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:27,230
there's also no<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate-limiting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

263
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,420
read it is very fast so you can also run

264
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,810
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> off command very fast so you can</font>

265
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:37,339
pretty much just start from forcing that

266
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:40,369
one password there is yeah but that's

267
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:43,100
the authentication they have and the

268
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:46,790
other feature i find very nice is hiding

269
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">commands so they have you set it in the</font>

270
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,589
configuration again and you need to

271
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:55,550
restart the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server to change that it's a</font>

272
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:57,290
bit security through obscurity so what

273
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,560
they have is if you have to come on

274
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">cough it you can say rename the command</font>

275
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,709
post it to my secret config name so it's

276
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,640
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the commander still there you</font>

277
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:15,240
just don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what it's called and one</font>

278
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,569
common approach is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

279
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,550
the parameter<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the commands name add</font>

280
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,050
some salt and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then just md5 hashes and</font>

281
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,729
then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that is the hatch and</font>

282
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:28,620
if I use that ash i'm using actually

283
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:30,630
decimal yeah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> since the networking is</font>

284
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,890
not encrypted like anybody listening on

285
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just see what you can</font>

286
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:36,959
answer call but yet it can rename

287
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:39,480
commands which is an interesting

288
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach what might make more sense is</font>

289
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,940
that you can kind of remove commands you

290
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">can just say they have an empty name and</font>

291
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,130
then they're gone then you cannot access

292
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:52,439
them anymore so that is kind of their

293
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,270
approach of removing features or

294
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,920
limiting the use of specific features

295
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,949
and have some some commands they

296
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,779
normally advise you to remove so they

297
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">have commands which make sense for test</font>

298
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:06,120
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you just drop all the keys</font>

299
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,320
you have in your key value store but

300
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,570
probably that's not what you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

301
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">your production system and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this poor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lua</font>

302
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,940
scripting and obviously don't pass in

303
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,239
random doing scripts otherwise that

304
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:25,230
stuff would happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and electric</font>

305
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:28,730
search well what do we are um we have

306
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:32,010
some security<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues over the years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

307
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:35,339
yeah they are on our website so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we try</font>

308
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:37,800
to document them as yeah publicly as

309
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:41,940
possible and if you take a closer look

310
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:45,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">um these are the most severe ones and</font>

311
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,339
they were related to scripting that

312
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:50,310
somebody could break out of the search

313
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:52,500
box so in the beginning we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had groovy</font>

314
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,849
scripting because it was since epic

315
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,589
search<font color="#E5E5E5"> is written in Java that was very</font>

316
00:14:53,850 --> 00:15:00,540
easy to add abuse and you have just

317
00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:01,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">scripts is very hard to contain improve</font>

318
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,170
escape to the general-purpose

319
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:07,979
programming language you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do lots of</font>

320
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,870
interesting stuff and that turned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

321
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,610
be very hard to contain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sandbox and</font>

322
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,800
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ex</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work colleague of mine</font>

323
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,930
he once had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> electric server so</font>

324
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,589
electric search server running somewhere

325
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:21,540
and yeah somebody I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know which one</font>

326
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:24,120
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle one the groovy</font>

327
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,459
sample is escape and somebody took over

328
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,040
his box and started spamming the world I

329
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,810
think it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> sending so many mates</font>

330
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,949
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sage into the box anymore be</font>

331
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,459
closing that the connection was so

332
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:38,189
unstable yeah so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

333
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:40,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem and elastic what kind of like</font>

334
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:43,889
maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should do something it's not</font>

335
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:46,860
the way we want this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go so we added</font>

336
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:50,430
something called payment to literally

337
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:56,009
take the pain away so pain that is our

338
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:58,829
own scripting language and yeah so we

339
00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:00,870
hired a developer and we put him into

340
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:03,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">exalted for a year and he developed</font>

341
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,430
painless there because there's not in

342
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:09,000
enough scripting languages you can only

343
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:12,300
hear always have n plus 1 and painless

344
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,759
is our n plus 1 and even wrote a blog

345
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,109
post afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that why we the</font>

346
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,699
brand new language shooing they're

347
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:22,709
always so many out there we still<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

348
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:25,050
because we kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thought it worth it</font>

349
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:27,660
or because we thought that there are no

350
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,180
really good alternatives for that so

351
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:34,800
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> two goals and security and</font>

352
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:37,229
performance security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and no more dvds on</font>

353
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,769
sandbox escapes and scripting is

354
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:42,089
possible and performance problem the

355
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:44,339
brewery scripting is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

356
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:47,970
interpreted every time it runs so there

357
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:49,649
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an overhead to that which we want to</font>

358
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">get rid of and so those were the two</font>

359
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:54,360
main goals of writing custom scripting

360
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:56,099
language so just to give you very

361
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,149
quickly sample of what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

362
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:03,770
the top line is a document and I have

363
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:06,780
played and some I don't know what it is

364
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:09,720
ok no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I scored like I</font>

365
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:12,480
played three games<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I score some</font>

366
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,829
goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I am about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many cities and now</font>

367
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,230
in our scripting language you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

368
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:19,918
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many goals did I score in total</font>

369
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:21,780
so since it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty familiar and</font>

370
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,089
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing that must be weird is</font>

371
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,740
that you take inputs document that

372
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:29,100
targets the documents we have set up

373
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:31,650
there yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goals yeah and then we</font>

374
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,020
operate from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add all</font>

375
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,559
the goals we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that is our final</font>

376
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:40,530
result so this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just have a</font>

377
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,600
general purpose is a language which

378
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:46,070
cannot escape sandbox and

379
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:49,199
forward so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has some features which</font>

380
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,418
don't really make much or too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much if</font>

381
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,450
internet security concepts unless unless

382
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:56,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">every value so we have methods and feet</font>

383
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,890
level whitelisting so only it's certain

384
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:01,140
stuff that we think makes sense is

385
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,059
allowed because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that much</font>

386
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,570
business in the past so you cannot say

387
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:08,129
class full name to just load any random

388
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:12,178
class you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have on the glass pass and</font>

389
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:14,220
then do with stuff with it so only kind

390
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:18,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sensible stuff is allowed and</font>

391
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:20,370
everything else is like visit so you

392
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:22,260
should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> escape that and</font>

393
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,139
that was kind of the main point of

394
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,940
creating that programming language by

395
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,679
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a default in the</font>

396
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,120
current version we still have scripting

397
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,940
language the other scripting languages

398
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,309
most people use groovy but we support

399
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,260
Python and JavaScript as well so they

400
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,990
are deprecated and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will definitely go</font>

401
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:43,260
away in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next major version so</font>

402
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:46,650
anybody doing scripting there we try to

403
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,530
force you into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right car</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

404
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,809
works and yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we have this</font>

405
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,340
authentication authorization and

406
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:58,678
encryption thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it's called SL</font>

407
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:02,520
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> refactored on all the encryption</font>

408
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:04,320
stuff in the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> major release and I</font>

409
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,150
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know why but unfortunately</font>

410
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,090
we caught the premise and now everywhere

411
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:12,840
ssl because before we had TLS and ssl

412
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:15,539
mix and obviously it is TLS but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

413
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,000
call it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cell so don't be confused</font>

414
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:19,590
by that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's still apps that we just</font>

415
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">call it into self for whatever reason</font>

416
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:25,189
but it's the same everywhere and so how

417
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,510
does it work out with elastic search

418
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:30,330
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is how my seller is</font>

419
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:33,629
being paid so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the commercial</font>

420
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:41,789
features we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you</font>

421
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:46,590
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came out end up let's do we do</font>

422
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:50,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">something live so should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

423
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:52,168
everybody knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay sorry I'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

424
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:55,510
touch anything I guess everybody knows

425
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:57,340
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> back right you can't just find</font>

426
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:59,800
stuff on the internet is just scanning

427
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:03,970
what is out there and then you can try

428
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:10,110
using that so we can do can just put in

429
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:16,990
elasticsearch here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope my wife I</font>

430
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:18,969
my yeah so we have some stuff called

431
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">elastic search but it's mostly for a one</font>

432
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,470
so they have a reverse proxy in front of

433
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:27,340
that so that is not going to help us so

434
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:29,620
we can just start searching for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 and</font>

435
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,689
we should get some more results and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

436
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:35,739
actually tells less than 600 results now

437
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:39,430
and I early this morning I try to login

438
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:41,650
into those and most of them I don't know

439
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,630
our either more<font color="#E5E5E5"> text or are probably a</font>

440
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,190
honey pot anyway like I'm pretty sure

441
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,960
any pretty much everything of that this

442
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,580
is a honey pot anymore so I didn't find

443
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,090
anything that was too revealing there

444
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,919
anymore but what I guess all the script

445
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:56,530
kiddies<font color="#CCCCCC"> has used those up already so you</font>

446
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,020
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just switch to port 9000 planet</font>

447
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:01,360
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the default elasticsearch port</font>

448
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:04,389
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going forward to hundreds now</font>

449
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:12,520
and that leaders should lead us to more

450
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:26,230
results the demo birds are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not with me</font>

451
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:28,840
oh come<font color="#CCCCCC"> on no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showdown is broken yeah</font>

452
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,940
probably too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> results okay since i</font>

453
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,209
since i have tried it i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have one</font>

454
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:37,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">working IP in my cash in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my command</font>

455
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:40,690
history so assume the site is up and you

456
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:43,990
get like with that search<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got i think</font>

457
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:46,390
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred thousand results you</font>

458
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:52,020
get an IPS and now you just were just

459
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:57,220
looking no touching just looking weird

460
00:21:52,020 --> 00:22:00,340
let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we have so on since</font>

461
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,930
elasticsearch is just providing a red

462
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,220
space interface is very easy to just

463
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,160
interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with curl you don't</font>

464
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:09,240
need any fancy tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just found the IP</font>

465
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:12,180
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> 54 blah blah blah</font>

466
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,340
hold 9200 and then i'm using the API

467
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,710
underscore kept it slides kept the

468
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:20,100
command line tool just show you stuff in

469
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:22,590
mep consumable session and images I'm

470
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">just interested in which indicates does</font>

471
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,879
this elasticsearch register have and the

472
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,530
question might be is just turn me the

473
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:34,020
header information for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well and</font>

474
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:35,820
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I run that it will tail tell me we</font>

475
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,639

486
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:14,610
it's nicely formatted as well and we

487
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:36,060
should close there and if I didn't miss

496
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,570
don't know what is it today 600 600

497
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">Europe so the problem is there is no</font>

498
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,689
reason aren t that

499
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:30,169
Rebecca<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've already seen instances</font>

500
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:32,210
like they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a few weeks ago there</font>

501
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:34,400
were there was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one team or</font>

502
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,700
person doing that for multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones and</font>

503
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,559
they left different messages and so kind

504
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,950
of somebody deleted you later and left

505
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:45,410
that message like please pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

506
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:50,540
and then somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else left another</font>

507
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:52,669
message so they didn't remove the the

508
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,220
one message which which like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

509
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:56,990
original ransom message but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

510
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,429
would add another ransom message and

511
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,679
then you probably would end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

512
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:02,179
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> three random messages and then you</font>

513
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:05,990
will need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide like who was there</font>

514
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:08,809
first like who probably has your data or

515
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:10,280
maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really know and</font>

516
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:14,418
then you can just start paying a loss

517
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:20,770
and hope for the best yeah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's not</font>

518
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:24,110
let it get that far so we've seen those

519
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:26,720
so the first thing you should do is so

520
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:29,149
by default like everybody else by now

521
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,280
but that also changed like one or two

522
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:32,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago only our electric search is</font>

523
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,280
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> found two local</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hood you will</font>

524
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">explicitly need to change the</font>

525
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,020
configuration if you want to bind<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

526
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,820
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> else just put it on a private</font>

527
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,679
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> only like with any data store</font>

528
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,860
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no real point in having it on a</font>

529
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,740
public IP put a firewall in front of it

530
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,740
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though I've like people think me on</font>

531
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter and said Oh our firewall kind of</font>

532
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,340
like we had some bad rules and the

533
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,280
firewall was just down for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour and</font>

534
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,860
somebody still took download data during

535
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,620
that one hour so firewalls are also not

536
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,969
not helping you all the time and what

537
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,559
you can always do is you can add a

538
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,169
random force but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is more like</font>

539
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,450
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> through obscurity which might</font>

540
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:14,390
help your like give you a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chance</font>

541
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:18,290
to avoid problems but yeah it's no real

542
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:20,030
solution and what you can do what you

543
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,799
can do for fries you can just use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

544
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">breasts proxy so since it's all</font>

545
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:26,780
http-based then everybody has lots of

546
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:30,139
experience with HTTP you can use engine

547
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:35,120
X H a proxy whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> just put a sender</font>

548
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:36,060
and and basic off and run that or we

549
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,370
have

550
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:40,020
ex extension for that as well and the

551
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,699
commercial extension can also do stuff

552
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,260
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifth level security or document</font>

553
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:48,090
level security which you cannot easily

554
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:50,460
deal with reverse proxy so and that is

555
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,260
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the cluster already because one</font>

556
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,260
other common scenario where people<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

557
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,420
problems if they had their nice little

558
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:59,610
proxy somewhere but then there has some

559
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,040
some other way around that to access the

560
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:06,419
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> store and yeah the proxy didn't</font>

561
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:09,300
really have them and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> something bad</font>

562
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,680
happens and please<font color="#CCCCCC"> make backups like if</font>

563
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,129
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have backups you shouldn't be</font>

564
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,600
in charge of anybody stay there anyway

565
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you can always read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from another</font>

566
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,760
source or just restore its nature if

567
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,560
you've taken and and it's the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

568
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,390
to guarantee to get your data back like

569
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,450
from what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought the chances if</font>

570
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:30,120
somebody will remove the data it might

571
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">not be dead great even though from the</font>

572
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">things instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find my now most</font>

573
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,200
of them are just forgotten testing

574
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">sentences or honey pots anyway so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

575
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,430
guess there is no point in starting a

576
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,280
new resume tech now if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels</font>

577
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:46,670
very motivated I guess like these feeds

578
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:50,940
has been harvested pretty well by now

579
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay to conclude um yes injections are</font>

580
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,500
still a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though no sequel</font>

581
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,790
doesn't have SQL or some have added kind

582
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,680
of SQL Lite interfaces by now as well

583
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:05,129
but injections are still a thing don't

584
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:09,120
pass in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> I escape stuff that just</font>

585
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:11,610
executing the datastore that is more

586
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,669
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the providers or vendors</font>

587
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:15,719
like please enable security but I guess

588
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,440
this is pretty much a learning

589
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,160
experience my secret didn't have

590
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,480
authentication authorization in the

591
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,360
beginning then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

592
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,040
enabled by default and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the notes</font>

593
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:29,100
equal world is kind of going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the</font>

594
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,320
same cycle as well we're at first you

595
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,540
don't have much then then you just find

596
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,500
to localhost and at some later point you

597
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:41,990
decide okay maybe we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enable this</font>

598
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,990
security security just slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

599
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">creativity can be interesting or not</font>

600
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,720
like reddit is always I'm always a bit

601
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,920
torn like hiding the commands<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

602
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">cruise</font>

603
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,870
another cool feature on the other hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

604
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:57,480
find that just answering queries are on

605
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:01,169
localhost and for remote series just

606
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,990
show you know fix that and configure

607
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:08,310
that that is final an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

608
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:11,400
approach yeah elastic we think that

609
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:13,260
custom scripting can make sense so far

610
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">we didn't have any security issues yet</font>

611
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:19,590
we'll see what time brings in the long

612
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,020
run yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's just I guess</font>

613
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,340
development thing like most of the

614
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,020
relational database has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

615
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,720
since the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s and had lots of security</font>

616
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">issues over the years and no sequel is</font>

617
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,980
kind of going through the same growing

618
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:35,250
pains i would say just learning

619
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,600
experience ah which you unfortunately

620
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,770
cannot really fast forward with

621
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere you need to pay that price</font>

622
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:46,770
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have lots of</font>

623
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,870
stickers here if you want secret there's

624
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:51,629
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my main obligations at tested</font>

625
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:59,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">student tickets are throughout Europe I</font>

626
00:29:51,630 --> 00:30:06,090
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by the way who</font>

627
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:10,620
is using MongoDB who admitted okay ready

628
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:13,800
okay that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more elastic search</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> source</font>

629
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:19,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">or more ok very nice um hey has anybody</font>

630
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:26,270
been renting no I'm always interested in

631
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:31,020
stories from the beach any questions

632
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:33,990
well well okay then<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I have a few</font>

633
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,450
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

634
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:39,660
how a single database or database

635
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,850
systems have sort of a hardened can meet

636
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,160
a security model that's grown over time

637
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:46,409
naturally and so my question for you is

638
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,650
this you talk about authentication

639
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:53,370
schemes and for you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lost over</font>

640
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:54,720
though the elastic search authentication

641
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:59,090
scheme what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the features of</font>

642
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,950
the authentication scheme there so

643
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,529
things

644
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:07,970
this is a basic off basically so yeah

645
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:10,370
you have to baby if you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> paper</font>

646
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:13,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">news you get TLS encryption but most</font>

647
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:16,639
basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and then you can limit that</font>

648
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:20,178
down to G Nixon like d mix was the

649
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:21,889
please read thing we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen and or in</font>

650
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:24,679
the highest<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan you could even limit</font>

651
00:31:21,889 --> 00:31:26,029
this down to fees so you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

652
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,360
everybody can see all the feeds of

653
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:31,789
employees but only the management can

654
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,459
see the speed salary so you could limit

655
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:36,408
that or just document where you could

656
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,809
say stuff like everybody can see all the

657
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:43,279
documents but if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> B was over ten</font>

658
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:45,200
thousand euro on this is 50 FPS and then

659
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,820
it passed example is not in reverse

660
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,860
proxy from the fish that is really part

661
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,019
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the culture and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no easy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

662
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:54,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to circumvent this so we have stuff like</font>

663
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:57,380
a year scism to target multiply<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

664
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:00,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">a remain soft but there is estimated</font>

665
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:03,830
time up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> course you can work</font>

666
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,830
around that in any way and then my next

667
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:09,529
question would be as a pen tester I

668
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,970
would be interested in paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

669
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:12,830
you have an authentication scheme that I

670
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:17,330
can't quite find pounder so do you have

671
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:22,399
the fruit horse protection oh nothing

672
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:25,220
I'm aware okay then my next question

673
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,379
would be you have a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as a pen</font>

674
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">tetra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have the next question do you</font>

675
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,429
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to set up a password policy</font>

676
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,240
such that people actually create<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

677
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Fergus for basic authentication yes</font>

678
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:41,409
let's think about it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> suit so must be</font>

679
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,919
13 characters long at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least a mixed case</font>

680
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:48,289
numbers special characters when I don't

681
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,789
think so buddy it's only a REST API so

682
00:32:48,289 --> 00:32:52,940
depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you interact with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

683
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:55,460
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up your own like we can hook</font>

684
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,230
into a supply as FX directory like we

685
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:02,630
can reuse that so if you have a purse

686
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:05,870
apology i will just reuse that actually

687
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:08,090
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't have eggs and yeah it would</font>

688
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">take two minutes to start off Jesus we</font>

00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:21,679
just like whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had</font>

application I mean that's yeah that's up

703
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,319
to your application then I mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

704
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:26,629
a it's not a porosity you cannot use a

710
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,810
of your client application right that

711
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:49,879
would need to be implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font>

kind application<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me today</font>
