actually kind of curious how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:14,739
because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not at all familiar with the</font>

audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> here how many of you would</font>

I don't like we could you<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever seen a website good we've got</font>

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,820
some common ground objective I work on

16
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,580
the chrome security and what I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

17
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,110
talk to you about today is the way that

18
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,580
we're approaching the web platform and

19
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way that we're approaching the API</font>

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,720
is that we give to developers and the

21
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:54,820
way the platform is designed in general

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,980
the platform has kind of organically

23
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,390
grown over time some pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

24
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,890
platform make a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sense and</font>

25
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,390
other pieces of the platform make no

26
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,860
sense whatsoever but they're kind of

27
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,229
these are black semantics that are stuck

28
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">with when I talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a platform I'm</font>

29
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:09,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">really talking about the AP is that we</font>

30
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,679
give to developments on the surface area

31
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's AP is present not only the</font>

33
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,210
note by the way that this link for

34
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:20,499
slides is up and available right now so

35
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,329
none of you have laptops which is great

36
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:24,759
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did have a laptop I would</font>

37
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:27,100
suggest that following along here would

<font color="#CCCCCC">be helpful just because there are a lot</font>

a brain dump of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a variety of projects</font>

42
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:37,420
important and if you're at all

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,039
interested in developing things for the

44
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,600
web these things are going to be paying

00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,219
are these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> api's</font>

46

that are available to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in the near</font>

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,298
her out of it so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider myself a web</font>

49
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:50,949
developer at heart I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of moved on</font>

50
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:53,139
from web development<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm starting i'm</font>

51
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,999
working in chrome itself so about five

52
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:57,069
or six<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago i started on the chrome</font>

team started programming in<font color="#E5E5E5"> c++ but</font>

54
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:01,810
before that I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the web and I</font>

55
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:04,270
did HTML CSS and JavaScript peloton was

56
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,920
a prime web developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very first</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> mrs. yes mosaic in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CS a mosaic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

59
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:14,950
think I got this and like my parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,959
internet in a box<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so it's a box</font>

61
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,879
delivered to our house it was great he

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">hooked up our modem we dialed in and use</font>

63
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,268
mosaic to get to various websites and

64
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,769
the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> websites at this</font>

65
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:30,190
point was like 94 95 and for me it was

66
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:32,019
absolutely transformative to see a few

67
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,849
source option here because I would

68
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:37,269
browse around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web and I did all this</font>

69
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:39,040
great information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I realized</font>

70
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:40,810
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only was there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information out</font>

71
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,459
there but I could create it myself and

72
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,739
this is factory today<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were coding</font>

73
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:46,540
everything by hand uphill both ways in

74
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,430
the snow so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually look at the</font>

75
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">source of a page and map it mentally</font>

76
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,450
pretty easily to what was rendered on

77
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,329
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wage so there was a one-to-one</font>

78
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,319
relationship here and it was really just

79
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">transformative for me to see that I</font>

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,780
myself could build these kinds of

81
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,220
websites about five years ago when I

82
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,200
started working on Chrome I realized

83
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,230
there was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of another layer of view</font>

84
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,750
source because all of that HTML CSS and

85
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,790
JavaScript is actually rendered to

86
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,410
receive electronic or through<font color="#CCCCCC"> rusts or</font>

87
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,920
threw out some other lower level

88
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:20,799
language and building those those

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,108
browsers is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> massive projects chrome</font>

90
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,569
chromium itself is hundreds of thousands

91
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:27,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">of lines of code we have lots of</font>

92
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,410
dependencies that bring the numbers up

93
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,900
significantly higher it's a large

94
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">project and anyone who's ever worked on</font>

95
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,859
a large<font color="#CCCCCC"> project will tell you that large</font>

96
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,690
projects are never finished and in fact

97
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:40,450
large projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> are always broken in</font>

98
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,220
various ways though it continually

99
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,380
surprises me that chrome works at all

100
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,180
because we keep walking through these

101
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">things you look at code you say this</font>

102
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,239
code is crap how could this ever have

103
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,870
worked and then you realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

104
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:55,239
yourself wrote it three years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

105
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,859
now you get to fix it so I've written a

106
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,880
number of to do's myself I looked

107
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:00,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the carrier-based last night</font>

108
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,019
there about 14,000 two dudes in the

109
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,790
topics there<font color="#E5E5E5"> another two or three</font>

110
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,920
thousand fix me comments in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

111
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing so there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of problems</font>

112
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we know about and we knew about</font>

113
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">them when we were writing the code</font>

114
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:12,310
because otherwise the comments wouldn't

115
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,690
be there<font color="#E5E5E5"> right if you look at the bug</font>

116
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,358
tracker than we have so if you go to see

117
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,728
our bug<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm you'll see another several</font>

118
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred thousand bugs that are open so</font>

119
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,409
people are reporting bugs to us it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

120
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,400
just bugs are you

121
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,960
and that we knew about when we were

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">writing but people are also telling us</font>

123
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,000
about things we didn't know about them

124
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:31,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're writing so the project itself is</font>

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,080
very physical it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large and we're</font>

human we're following<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

127
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,919
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistakes so there are bugs in the</font>

128
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:38,390
project that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know about their bugs in</font>

129
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,250
the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't know about and</font>

130
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:44,630
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these together mean that the</font>

131
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:46,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">project itself is broken but imagine</font>

132
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">magic promotes imagine that a team of</font>

133
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,800
elves came in overnight and fix every

134
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,170
bug<font color="#CCCCCC"> incur may be absolutely perfect it</font>

135
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,570
would implement every standard perfectly

136
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,490
so every line of every standard is done

137
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,590
the elders even at tests so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

138
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,900
won't drastic screams so we have a

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,210
well-tested perfect implementation of

140
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,859
every standard out there for the web my

141
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,510
contention is that it would still be

142
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,070
broken and it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> broken not</font>

143
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,599
because the code didn't do what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

144
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,640

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,410
implications of those expectations are

146
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,820
actually different than what we thought

147
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,310
they were we were designing things in

148
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,770
the personals the platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,840

<font color="#E5E5E5">especially true for really old things so</font>

152
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,500
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the original HTML spec</font>

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,900

design that make it difficult for us to

157
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,919
really lock things out there are just

158
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,870
some things that we made some really

159
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,700
good decisions way back when so maybe

160
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,370
same origin policy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> website so that</font>

161
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:52,640
you know your example<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm cannot access</font>

bank conferences that wasn't a given so

163
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,490
way back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the day they were really</font>

164
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,720
there were actual questions about

165
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,030
whether it should be possible for you to

166
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,620
load data from anywhere and to make

167
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,950
requests anywhere and to just treat

168
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,240
everything is one big<font color="#CCCCCC"> homogenous pool of</font>

169
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,099
data and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes a lot of sense when</font>

170
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,810
it's used for science<font color="#E5E5E5"> and literature it</font>

171
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,669
makes significantly less sense to infuse

172
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,960
for baking baking applications so we

173
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,880
made some good decisions way back line

174
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,950
but we also made<font color="#E5E5E5"> some bad decisions and</font>

175
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,030
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way that</font>

176
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,349
the chrome team is approaching this

177
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,090
position so<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the way that the current</font>

178
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,490
team is those looking backwards to try

00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,799
to fix old 80<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but also looking</font>

180
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,870
forwards to design new<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP is in ways</font>

181
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,450
that actually make sense so the chrome

182
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,150
team is really concerned with<font color="#E5E5E5"> regard to</font>

183
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,380
the web platform with<font color="#CCCCCC"> too well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

184
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">really concerned with two main classes</font>

185
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,469
of attacks

186
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,090
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assume that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser is perfect</font>

187
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,410
I assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the elves came in at some</font>

188
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,419
point and fixed all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

189
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,860
implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> bugs and what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am trying</font>

190
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,780
to do and my team is trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

191
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,690
actually build on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,219
Kwazii perfect system and leave the

193
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,140
imperfections to the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

security<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about finding</font>

195
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,760
all those bugs in six mo so from my

196
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,910
perspective but browser itself by design

197
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,760
is a confused deputy so this describes a

198
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:04,460
class of attack that uses the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser's</font>

199
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,190
privileged position as your agent on the

200
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,469
web so we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a user agent the</font>

201
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,270
browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you represented to the web</font>

202
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the browser makes requests on your</font>

203
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,960
behalf the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser's stores data on your</font>

204
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">behalf and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> browser</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shares data on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

205
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,280
behalf and it can very easily be tricked

206
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,230
into doing things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> neither the</font>

207
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,840
server nor the client actually wants it

208
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,270
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> so two broad classes of attacks</font>

209
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,739
are things that I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to fix no</font>

210
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,330
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really important the first</font>

211
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,070
is called cross-site scripting who's

212
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,240
heard of cross-site scripting everyone

213
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,640
as I said you said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

214
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,280
developers what's going on cross-site

215
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,650
scripting is as you all know a mechanism

216
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,450
of tricking a server into delivering

217
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,270
code that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server doesn't actually</font>

218
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,770
expect to be delivering so I talked

219
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,950
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same origin policy earth and</font>

220
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,409
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably know any code that</font>

221
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,570
executes in the context of an origin has

222
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,860
all the power of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> origin so if I can</font>

223
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,310
trick a server into delivering

224
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,810
JavaScript then the server will send

225
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,610
that JavaScript down to the client the

226
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:05,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">crime will execute if you know anything</font>

227
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,650
about v8 in grown you know that VA loans

228
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript and wants to execute</font>

229
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,219
absolutely as quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

230
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,780
this is a great thing when it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

231
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">too did you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attend it's kind of a</font>

232
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">terrible thing if the code isnt what you</font>

233
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:17,500
actually wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone so</font>

234
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,729
cross-site scripting is a big problem

235
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,350
almost every website is going to have an

236
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:23,210
injection attack of one sort or another

237
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google husband Jeff Kent attacks even</font>

238
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,330
though we have an internal security team

239
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,280
whose entire job is dedicated to

240
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,810
preventing these kinds of attacks it's

241
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,940
quite possible that<font color="#E5E5E5"> besides that you're</font>

242
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsible parasites that teams your</font>

243
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,240
companies are responsible for has

244
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,890
similar kinds of holes if you look at

245
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,620
the vulnerability reward program at

246
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,380
Google where we take researchers to tell

247
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,820
us about bugs instead of exploiting them

248
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,830
we see that cross-site scripting is

249
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,200
easily the largest category

250
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have at people again even though we</font>

251
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,260
invest a ton in stimulating systems and

252
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">even though we invested time into</font>

253
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,450
education internally so the second kind

254
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,859
of attack that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is pretty</font>

255
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called site request</font>

256
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,180
forgery so again the browser doesn't

257
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,100
really understand what's going chrome

258
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,959
firefox whoever it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

259
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,760
requests on your behalf<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when it</font>

260
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,400
makes those requests it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

261
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,439
them with your sword with you as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

262
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,610
user initiating the request or at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

263
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like to the server</font>

264
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,620
so is evil<font color="#E5E5E5"> com makes a request to bang</font>

265
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">com it's going to send your cookies</font>

266
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,920
along with its going to send the token

267
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,050
of the bound tokens along with it and

268
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,670
the channel ID and whatever else so all

269
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,160
of the authentication information is

270
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,500
being sent along with leezar advice so

271
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,209
if the server is not defending itself

272
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,820
against this kind of attack that it's

273
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,710
quite possible for evil<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm to change</font>

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">safe on bank calm perhaps by</font>

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,250
another and I'll talk a little bit about

280
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:52,040
the strategies<font color="#CCCCCC"> really different don't</font>

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:55,130
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mario Heinrich Mario is a</font>

282
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,740
great job he's incredibly smart last

283
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,870
year he suggested that web security has

284
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">become a paradox that web apps both</font>

285
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,030
complex and secure cannot be built that

286
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:08,570
the web staff has grown beyond that

287
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:10,040
being possible yay so he's happy I think

288
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,290
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy because it's a pen tester so</font>

289
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,969
he really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants these holes to continue</font>

290
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,680
to exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that you can keep hacking</font>

291
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,160
into websites and educating developers

292
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,050
but i find this sentiment somewhat

293
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,550
nihilistic and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it's</font>

294
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,439
unfortunate when we look at the platform

295
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say well the platform is large and</font>

296
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's powerful so therefore it's</font>

297
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,500
indefensible I think instead what we

298
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,350
should do is actually examine the

299
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,360
platform and figure out what changes we

300
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,220
can reasonably make so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> current</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

301
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,110
at least the web platform side of the

302
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,600
chrome team is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interested in</font>

303
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:43,490
measuring the usage of various things on

304
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,160
the web so we have a metric system

305
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,930
internally where if a user ups into

306
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,780
sharing usage data we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind of figure</font>

307
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:52,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">out how often certain api's are used so</font>

308
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,439
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not really complicated</font>

309
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,630
counters it's really just if a thing

310
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,070
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> and increment something and then</font>

311
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,130
we look at those<font color="#E5E5E5"> counters and say well</font>

312
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,100
on expert

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:04,200
pageviews<font color="#E5E5E5"> wife and using this kind of</font>

314
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,060
information we can look at the old<font color="#CCCCCC"> API</font>

315
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that we don't like and we can look at</font>

316
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,810
the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those api's are actually</font>

317
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,640
used and try to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what changes</font>

318
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,109
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can reasonably make in order to make</font>

319
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,790
those api's better so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like</font>

320
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything else is Google we try to be</font>

321
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,780
data-driven and we try to understand the

322
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,910
impact on users but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean</font>

323
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the platform is immutable so we</font>

324
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,780
definitely want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look back at these</font>

325
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,910
old api's and figure out what kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

326
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:29,819
changes we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> really make at the same</font>

327
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:32,459
time we want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward and we want</font>

328
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,230
to give developers<font color="#E5E5E5"> API so something we</font>

329
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about internally in the chrome team</font>

330
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:40,530
a lot is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea of giving developers</font>

331
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,180
sharp tools so if you've ever cooked or

332
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,490
cut anything with a knife you'll

333
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,650
recognize that a sharp knife is

334
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:49,170
significantly easier to use and

335
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,970
therefore significantly safer than a

336
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,979
dull knife if you have a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> sharp</font>

337
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:54,750
knife it'll cut right through things you

338
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,850
don't have to exert much pressure which

339
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a great degree of control</font>

340
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,660
over where the blade is going if you

341
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:03,120
have a dull knife and you can't really

342
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,040
cut anything unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> exert a lot of</font>

343
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,690
pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you exert a lot of</font>

344
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,520
pressure do you use control over where

345
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:11,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the knife is going so if you're cutting</font>

346
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,689
some food it's quite likely that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

347
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,830
have to press really really hard to deny

348
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,380
it will slip and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up cutting</font>

349
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:19,170
yourself so we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give developers</font>

350
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,000
sharp tools because we see when we don't

351
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,069
give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> sharp tools that we end up</font>

352
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,250
with things like flash areas that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we say</font>

353
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,440
exactly if we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give them the tools</font>

354
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,240
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> platform they will route around</font>

355
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,040
the platform in whatever ways they can

356
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,660
they will see the platform is damaged

357
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,430
and they'll route around it so you'll

358
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">get things like flash that end up</font>

359
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,870
causing significantly more problems over

360
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,940
a longer period of time than a

361
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,320
well-designed API<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually gave</font>

362
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,330
them the power to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things they</font>

363
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,320
wanted to do in the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> place so the</font>

364
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">current team is really interested in</font>

365
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving people sharp tools and if you</font>

366
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,500
look at sharp tools you recognize a

367
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,720
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think are really</font>

368
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,690
good metaphors for security on the web

369
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,670
so you'll see that the tool has a sharp

370
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,250
piece I mean not so sharp piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

371
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:04,620
relatively obvious in between those two

372
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:07,440
pieces however you'll see a little brass

373
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,750
bar and at the guard so the guard serves

374
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,190
a couple of important purposes first it

375
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,810
stops the knife from sliding down your

376
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,450
hand cutting yourself

377
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,619
on the sharp blade so it gives you

378
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,690
context in which you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

379
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,430
this tool makes the tool easier to use

380
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,190
and give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> some guidance as to how it</font>

381
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:26,310
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you hold the hills you don't</font>

382
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,529
hold the blade second it stops sharp

383
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,560
objects from sliding down the blade to

384
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:33,089
cut your hand so if you're a fight if

385
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,040
don't my type but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

386
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,660
fighting then you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a knife</font>

387
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,279
that has a guard because it will

388
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,839
actually stop the opponent's knife from

389
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,910
sliding down your<font color="#E5E5E5"> blade</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and cutting year</font>

390
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,740
and a half so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it protects you from</font>

391
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,029
things on the web and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

392
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,339

393
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:50,100
opt-in protection its structure it's

394
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:53,310
built into the tool itself so you are

395
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,500
protected in some way from attackers on

396
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,849
the web just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by having this tool because</font>

397
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,860
the tool is designed in such a way to

398
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,740
perfection the second thing you'll

399
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,600
notice is that knives and swords<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

400
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">other bladed instruments usually have a</font>

401
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,400
sheet or a scabbard or some mechanism by

402
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,200
which you can put the knives away and

403
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,610
make it blunt so if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> pigs at</font>

404
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">home you probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to leave a</font>

405
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:16,470
sharp knife lying around you once said

406
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,209
put it away into a knife block or into a

407
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,490
sheath or a scabbard or something and

408
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:22,200
that will actually build a knife<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

409
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,460
the outside of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sheet is not going to</font>

410
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,370
cut anybody you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can hit them on the head</font>

413
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,350
you know that you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use</font>

414
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,240
it's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good metaphor for the</font>

kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Austin protection so we can</font>

sites down more more securely than we

419

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,820
putting various api's into she's so

430
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,130
let's start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea of a guard</font>

431
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,290
what are the structural changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

432
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,000
can make the web to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> better to</font>

433
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">make the api's on the platform that we</font>

434
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,790
provide the developers more sensical and

435
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:20,310
more sensible the very first thing we

436
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,560
need to do is improve TLS that's

437
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,420
absolutely critical this structural

438
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,400
change is something that's been ongoing

439
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,849
over time so the chrome team has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

440
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,220
very

441
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,410
just over time at getting folks to start

442
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,139
using encryption and start using<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS</font>

443
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,459
as opposed to http I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Firefox is</font>

444
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,250
published their telemetry that shows

445
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:40,018
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they finally gone over the fifty</font>

446
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:43,620
percent mark so people's people in

447
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Firefox use more pls than non TLS and</font>

448
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,730
police in terms of time they're browsing

449
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,430
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chrome has similar numbers</font>

450
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,839
published on Google's HTTPS transparency

451
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,359
you haven't seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think it's</font>

452
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,880
pretty interesting it shows you excuse

453
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,259
me it shows you how much rules traffic

454
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,319
is encrypted and I think it's something

455
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:02,880
like EV nine percent at the moment the

456
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,790
outdoor incoming traffic and it also

457
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,550
gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an overview of kind of where</font>

458
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,649
websites are and what large websites

459
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,180
have transferred over and what and

460
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:13,529
whether they have good TLS

461
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,359
configurations and then what websites

462
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:16,620
have in trans terminators there's a

463
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">really great website in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> state's</font>

464
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,209
called secure the news and this actually

465
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:23,160
do through a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of news websites and</font>

466
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:26,189
will tell you whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're</font>

467
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,959
using HTTPS now news websites in the

468
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,670
states are not great there are a lot of

469
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,920
these websites that are using TLS and

470
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,569
actually some large websites have just

471
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,979
made the jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in New York Times for</font>

472
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:36,870
instance just transferred over I think

473
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,870
last month which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

474
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,329
exciting news sites in Germany are not

475
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,639
quite with the game or at least I

476
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:47,370
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen them be that way so to go</font>

477
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">outside Eagles Stan these are all not</font>

478
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,779
available over TLS and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

479
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,930
them some of them will actually redirect

480
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:57,000
you to http if you do to https others

481
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:00,060
will not even load the page at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all so if</font>

482
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,769
you go to build<font color="#CCCCCC"> https do that ze it will</font>

483
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,359
give you a 410 error that says this page

486
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,000
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you any data it just gives you an</font>

error<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just kind of said regardless</font>

488
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:17,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">new sites and these kinds of non login</font>

489
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:19,949
sites are things that some people think

490
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:22,079
don't really need TLS because you know

491
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,360
why do you really care TLS gives you a

492
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,860
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of important benefit it gives you</font>

493
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,658
a modicum of integrity that is you know

494
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bits that are being delivered over</font>

495
00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:33,539
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire or actually intact when they</font>

496
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,520
get to you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modified by</font>

497
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:36,590
someone in between so if folks aren't

498
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,389
injecting as

499
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,039
your websites and they're not changing

500
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,779
your website so that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

501
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:43,490
there's an article on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deutsche that</font>

502
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:46,190
is actually süddeutsche I writing it

503
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:48,770
and not Vodafone injecting an article

504
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,659
that's really positive about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vodafone so</font>

505
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,580
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrity you also get</font>

506
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:54,590
authentication that is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

507
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,449
server that you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

508
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,580
server that's justifiably using that

509
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:01,010
name so it's not any signal to the it's

510
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,840
actually be supposed to be you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

511
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,029
gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measure of confidentiality</font>

512
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,439
so no one knows what articles you're

513
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:07,850
reading so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you're really</font>

514
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,500
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new Power Rangers</font>

515
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,330
movie no one's going to judge you for it

516
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,740
because no one knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're really</font>

517
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,668
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our interest movie</font>

518
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:18,470
probably a good movie<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you know one</font>

519
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:21,799
of the things that's changed recently is

520
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduction of lesson</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grants anyone</font>

521
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:26,029
heard that let's encrypt excellent

522
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,490
wonderful lesson grip is really exciting

523
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:30,980
because it is a certificate<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority</font>

524
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,390
that has significantly better properties

525
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,460
and a lot of certificate authorities had

526
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,980
in the past a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people have really</font>

527
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,840
focused on the free notion let's encrypt

528
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,130
that is it gives you a certificate you

529
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,168
don't have to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> them for it and that's</font>

530
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,480
great because it really opens the doors

531
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:46,610
to a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that weren't going to</font>

532
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,130
pay for certs but should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> circus</font>

533
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:52,158
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think actually the more important</font>

534
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:54,380
change is not free but automated that is

535
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a protocol called Acme which</font>

536
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,270
allows you to obtain a certificate for a

537
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:01,010
server without manually going through

538
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:03,230
the process of going out grabbing a

539
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,390
surge installing on your on your server

540
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,740
and then setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up your server such as</font>

541
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:10,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's actually using the cert to deliver</font>

542
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:12,320
to deliver an encrypted connection the

543
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,970
automation portion of this is incredibly

544
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,158
important it's important for a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

545
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,899
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> saving status quo you'll</font>

546
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,640
generally go to Samantha you'll buy a

547
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:22,908
search it'll be good for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

548
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,399
years and after three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one day</font>

549
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:27,110
you'll run a fire drill because<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

550
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:28,549
wonder the company has<font color="#E5E5E5"> any idea how to</font>

551
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,139
deploy a cert because the last time you

552
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:31,490
did it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> three years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and the three</font>

553
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">people responsible for it have all left</font>

554
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">the company so each I'm sorry or they</font>

555
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,080
don't remember right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did no one</font>

556
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,059
documents thing so when there is a fire

557
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,590
drill and when your cert has expired you

558
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,480
need to go out and figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to do</font>

559
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,678
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff and it just it never</font>

560
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,649
works out the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's supposed to</font>

561
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,909
let's encrypt I think by default right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

562
00:19:48,649 --> 00:19:51,039
think

563
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:53,109
right now only serves<font color="#E5E5E5"> our only gives you</font>

564
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,359
a certain from 90 days and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

565
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:58,389
goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reduce that so that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

566
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,789
three years but 60 days or 30 days or

567
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:02,769
three days these kinds of short-lived

568
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:04,359
certificates I would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to see</font>

569
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,799
that be the norm for a variety of

570
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:09,340
reasons first of all because it's

571
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:10,539
automated looks thank you because it's

572
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,580
automated and because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

573
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:14,289
protocol behind it and there's a program

<font color="#E5E5E5">running on your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> theater it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

something that you do on a regular basis

00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:19,690
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> become part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your normal</font>

one-off thing that you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> three times a</font>

579

decade it also gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> us the opportunity</font>

to change the civic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ecosystem more</font>

deprecate sha-1 as a signature algorithm

587
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,019
for certificates because it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> these days it has taken an</font>

590
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:52,840

591
00:20:51,009 --> 00:20:54,999
reticence on the part of ca's to make

592

absolutely going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Perdido system that</font>

605
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:21,849
said deploying a certificate is still

00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:23,379
more difficult than it ought to be there

607
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:25,809
are a couple of servers coming out these

608
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:27,668
days that actually build TLS into the

core infrastructure of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server so</font>

610
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:31,539
caddy is one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> County is</font>

611
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:33,220
incredibly simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set up and all you</font>

00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:35,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to do is point a dns name at it and</font>

613
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,970
then you will get a cert it'll get a

614
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:39,249
certain on your behalf it will renew the

615
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,169
cert on your behalf and it continually

616
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:42,639
updates the configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

617
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:45,460
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about things</font>

619

anything you all you have to do is

00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:51,189
deploy caddy and then like magic your

keep getting better over time wire is an

that has migrated over to

JLS and what they did is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think is</font>

626
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:07,090
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice it has put together a series</font>

627
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,159
of articles talking about the way they

628
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,049
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the migration and the problems that</font>

629
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,059
they ran into overtime and this was

630
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,460
incredibly useful to us as browser

631
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:17,289
vendors and also as API designers to

632
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,509
kind of figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the holes were</font>

633
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:20,950
and where people were running in pain so

634
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:22,149
these are really good articles if you're

635
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,159
at all interested in migrating your

their website or tails<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay actually so</font>

639
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,179
those folks I would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend</font>

640
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,979
that you take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at these articles</font>

641
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:37,269
and the rest of you they didn't want to

642
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">admit the fact that your site is not a</font>

644
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:41,349
these articles because they really go

645
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,479
through a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the struggles that</font>

said like an hour it's relatively

650
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:53,468
straightforward I knew all the content

651
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:56,799
just five months this don't

652
00:22:53,469 --> 00:22:58,929
significantly longer and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

653
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,519
what what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these</font>

654
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:02,139
kinds of larger sites is that they run

655
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:04,779
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> very different problems than you</font>

656
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:07,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">see on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> smallest one of those problems is</font>

657
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:09,580
mixed content so mixed content is

658
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:13,178
basically a guarantee that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we give to</font>

659
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,859
users we say if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see TLS that is if</font>

660
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:16,570
you see an encrypted connection we want

661
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:17,918
to verify to you that everything on this

662
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:19,389
page is encrypted because otherwise

663
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,940
we're lying to you if we tell you that

664
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:25,449
it's secure so we block<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

665
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,399
script loaded from AC or from<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTP on an</font>

666
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,659
HTTPS side because there's no integrity

667
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:31,928
for that script it could be anyone

668
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:33,070
delivering script at this page and this

669
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:35,710
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we think that</font>

670
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,629
certainly wired saw and other folks have

671
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,269
seen as a real blocker towards us how to

672
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:43,418
migration there are large news

673
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:44,979
organizations that have run websites for

674

long enough that they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost the</font>

through those database entries and

684
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,258
modify them because you know they might

685
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:07,379
break things and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

of recovering from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that breakage so</font>

687
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:11,949
we've talked a little bit with these

688
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,870
folks and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tried to design a P is</font>

for them that enable<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to</font>

continue serving their websites but do

it in a secure way so one of those is

00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,880
the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that you deliver this</font>

HTTP header along with the page and you

721
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,809
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know that i spelled things HTTP on</font>

this page but please browser help me<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

723
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:27,250
here and we'll do that upgraded security

working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but they're not quite there</font>

733
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,139
and this gives you a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

734
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,809
coverage with regard to upgrade it to

request and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this library</font>

736
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:56,440
will to see that they found this to be

737
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,900
an absolutely critical portion of their

738
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,510
upgrade backers so allowing them to do

739
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">this allowing them to up great things</font>

740
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:06,250
about actually changing things on disk

741
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,170
was incredibly valuable to go so the

742
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,970
inverse of it you'll recognize it

743
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:12,670
upgraded secure requests is basically

744
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,660
the site asserting to the browser that

745
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,910
it's supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be loading phase</font>

746
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,980
generation guess so asserting the

<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party resources should actually be</font>

issued yes the inverse of this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

749
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,020
those third parties asserting if they

should always be loaded<font color="#E5E5E5"> their accts</font>

751
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,950
even if you sell them as HTTP so a good

752
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,690
example of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be youtube com</font>

that's what they were when the person

originally copy and pasted it and no

those requests to unblock those websites

772
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,730
from actually upgrading to TLS without

773
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:13,580
forcing them to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all their</font>

774
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,570
code and make changes unfortunately this

775
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,030
introduces a little bit of

776
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,460
non-determinism because you as a

777
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:21,800
developer have been to every resource

778
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,290
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you require you've been to your CDN</font>

779
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,090
you have the hfcs pin for that website

780
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,399
so you know that you're always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

781
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">load a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> diverse CBS but your users have</font>

be to your cpa or never will go to your

784
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:36,830
TV a which means they will see breakage

785
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,720
they will file bugs you will close the

786
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,889
bugs because it works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and then</font>

787
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,080
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be sad when you actually</font>

788
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:45,350
figure out what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what we'd</font>

789
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">like to do is reverse the order of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hsps</font>

790
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:51,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">admix content so that hsps happens first</font>

791
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,670
does the upgrade but<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it in such a</font>

792
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,980
way as to not introduce this non

793
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:57,050
deterministic behavior so one approach

794
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,550
to this that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox is implemented and</font>

795
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,720
is in the process of applying or at

796
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,090
least as a mountain i'm experimenting

797
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,950
with it's something called hspf priming

798
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:06,620
and the idea here is that if we're going

799
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:09,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to load a non-secure resource we will</font>

800
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:12,050
first make an HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> x request to that</font>

801
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:14,000
origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say hey do you have HS yes</font>

802
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,409
and if you do great we'll keep will

803
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,570
store that pen and then we'll upgrade

804
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:19,400
the request and this removes the this

805
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,439
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a deterministic process that is</font>

806
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,240
we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> always get the pin if there is</font>

807
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,650
append to be gotten and because of that

808
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,770
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to invert these and</font>

809
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,610
allow those third parties to actually

810
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,400
assert something about their own

811
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">resources which I think I'll be pretty</font>

812
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,470
I would know however that this isn't

813
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,300
just for websites it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

814
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:40,690
important to encrypt communications

815
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:43,300
likes email forensics start TLS has been

816
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:45,690
around for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it isn't is</font>

817
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,800
an opportunistic encryption bag where a

818
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:50,470
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wants to send us an email</font>

819
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:54,310
will ask permission to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send some email</font>

820
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:55,810
from an SMTP server and it will along

821
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,700
with that you'll say hey I can totally

822
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,830
encrypt this if you wanted me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

823
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,360
get the right response back then the

824
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,610
transmission<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be upgraded to an</font>

825
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,379
encrypted pls connection and then you'll

826
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:06,550
send the email over an encrypted

827
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,960
connection which is great because that

828
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,370
means people can read your email<font color="#E5E5E5"> or at</font>

829
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,550
least no one but those two parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

830
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:15,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">agree unfortunately because it's</font>

831
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:16,510
opportunistic is trivially blocked so an

832
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,860
active network attacker only has to

833
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">block a single header in the response</font>

834
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,449
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trivia it happens all</font>

835
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,940
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because people want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

836
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,440
to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> email any virus does it's a lot</font>

837
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,780
where it says oh I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can't read</font>

838
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,980
TLS but I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just stop that TLS stuff so</font>

839
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can parse all these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> messages and</font>

840
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:36,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">then stop it from getting the server any</font>

841
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:39,430
virus so it's a thing MTA<font color="#CCCCCC"> FPS is</font>

842
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:42,940
basically applying the notion of HTTP or

843
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:44,920
a chest es tu email so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a DNS</font>

844
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,990
entry or you have a file sitting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">server somewhere that expresses a policy</font>

846
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:52,660
about your email sir by doing so you can

847
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:54,310
actually in an out-of-band way assert

848
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:57,100
that you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have a TLS</font>

849
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,570
connection to me when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> Latino so</font>

850
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,030
this gives you similar properties they

851
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,740
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> es on the web if you have an email</font>

yeah encrypted communication is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:16,510
I'd also note that again looking back at

857
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:18,430
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of old api's it's it been</font>

858
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,440
the case we have launched a lot of AP is

859
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking back we kind of wish we</font>

860
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,430
hadn't launched in that way in

00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:26,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular there are a lot of AP is that</font>

865
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:34,300
kind of canonical example it shouldn't

866
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,590
be the case that by giving a origin to

867
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,000
your location permissions you're giving

868
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,250
anyone on the network between you and

869
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,840
that origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> glf inspiration because it</font>

870
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,800
is a non-secure origin there is no

871
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,209
authenticity which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

872
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,770
four words that content to my heart's

00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">content so I can grab</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your location</font>

874
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:50,120
just by being an active network backer

875
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,800
that's kind of unfortunate what we're

876
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:56,600
trying to do now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is looking forward only</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">launched new colorful AP is that are</font>

878
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,159
using TL their locks through a secure

879
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,170
contacts so you can have geolocation on

880
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:06,230
18 yes but you can't have geo location

881
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:08,710
of HTTP there are a variety of API doing

882
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:12,050
so geolocation is a canonical example

883
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:14,870
web crypto getusermedia so your camera

884
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:17,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and your microphone credential Iseman</font>

API service workers payment<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests and</font>

886
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:22,730
many many more the idea is these kinds

887
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,960
of AP is especially if you guys that

888
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,930
have permissions associated with them

889
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:29,900
are only it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a meaningful granted</font>

890
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:31,670
permission if it's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> to in a context</font>

891
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,740
you can assert something about you can't

892
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,420
discern anything about HTTP so giving

893
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,820
access to these api is a very should be

894
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,440
is simply about idea again looking at

895
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data that we have we've been able to</font>

896
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,270
deprecate a number of these api is over

897
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:47,300
HTTP so geolocation was turned off last

898
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:49,700
year at the early last year over HTTP so

899
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,139
you can only<font color="#CCCCCC"> access reservation yeah my</font>

900
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,720
hope is and will become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggressive</font>

901
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,370
of others<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like to live in a</font>

902
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,490
world where we only launched new API

903
00:31:55,370 --> 00:32:00,110
over HTTPS that's been a difficult sell

904
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,910
both internally and externally but i

905
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:03,050
think that browser vendors in general or

906
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,870
started to get on board with the idea

907
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:09,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shipping new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP is simply</font>

908
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:11,209
that idea the last kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of structure</font>

909
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,580
will change<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll quantum at is a</font>

910
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:16,160
distinction between internet and

911
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,570
Internet so again your browser is a

912
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,670
privilege is in a privileged<font color="#CCCCCC"> position</font>

913
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,070
and is acting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your behalf with your</font>

915
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,550
actually the network that you're

916
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,080
connected to if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to be in an</font>

access to different kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

919
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,179
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would have access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you from</font>

920
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,190
outside that office because you're in

00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:36,680
trusted internal network you're running

922

<font color="#CCCCCC">on a trusted machine and you're able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

923
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,130
make requests to things like your

00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,060
people's routers because routers are

generally at known location so one that

so that you're using the tuckers dns

very different than the web that

give a website a little bit more access

00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:04,099
so Dropbox for instance wants to know

that defines and a couple of other

1001
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,810
resource sharing and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a</font>

1002
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:20,640
system by which origin one can ask

1006
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,800
I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do is extend that to</font>

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> force a course pre-flight for</font>

any request that crosses<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these</font>

1009
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,830

1010
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,390
web to localhost the browser will first

00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,860
send an option to request the local is

1012
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,080
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay do you understand the course</font>

1013
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,340

1016
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:52,020
have to set up if if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the software is</font>

1017
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,460
written in such a way that is acceptance

<font color="#CCCCCC">requests and sends a reasonable response</font>

1019
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,570
back then it will allow the request if

1020
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:59,100
the software doesn't respond because

1021
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,810
doesn't understand options or doesn't

1022
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,910
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> this protocol it will lock it</font>

1023
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:05,400
down and we'll make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web is</font>

1024
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,420
incapable talking to things like hold

1025
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,950
routers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> never going to be</font>

1026
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,210
updated I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

1027
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,100
interesting it turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be really</font>

1028
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,750
difficult to implement because figuring

1029
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,940
out what IP address are going to be

1030
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,520
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to is actually pitiable</font>

1031
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:19,680
especially when ipv4 ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> world there's</font>

1032
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,750
the the best named algorithm that I've

1033
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever heard is called happy idle and no</font>

1034
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,290
idea what's called happy august so the

1035
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:28,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is that you race life easy for an</font>

1036
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:29,310
ipv6 connection and whichever responds

1037
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,960
first is the ones you're actually going

1038
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,310
to talk to you so its way down deep in

1039
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,540
the network stack and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1040
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,920
difficult to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the point that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1041
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,210
know what connection i'm going to talk

1042
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you at a point where i can actually</font>

1043
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,690
make this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of creeped record class</font>

1044
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,580
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have like half an implementation of</font>

1045
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,160
this and blink and it turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

1046
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have to do a little anyway</font>

1047
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,600
let's move<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the notion pass these</font>

1048
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,980
structural changes to opt-in changes

1049
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,810
that developers that building websites

1050
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,910
can use make their own websites more

1051
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,100
secure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first and foremost of these</font>

1052
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,379
is called content<font color="#E5E5E5"> security policy common</font>

1053
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,940
security policy is a policy mechanism

1054
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:03,210
that allows you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> determine what</font>

1055
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:06,060
resources load on your page the basic

1056
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:08,220
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you have resource and</font>

1057
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:10,049
various types and you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay script</font>

1058
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,080
can load from these origins it can load

1059
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:15,150
for my CDN it can load from me myself

1060
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,828
but it can't load from you belong and

1061
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,049
they can't load from

1062
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:21,479
and this actually gives you the ability

1063
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:22,829
to lock down your site to prevent

1064
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:24,359
cross-site scripting attacks or at least

1065
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:26,249
mitigate the risks associated with

1066
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:28,380
cross-site scripting<font color="#E5E5E5"> common security</font>

1068
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,459
years now we're kind of just now getting

1069
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:35,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where it's useful we've</font>

job<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their common security quality</font>

1072
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,950
they've actually put a ton of work into

1073
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:44,369
locking down the origins from our stated

1074
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:47,519
resources and they have probably the

1075
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:49,170
best list based on security policies

1076
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've seen where they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually know</font>

a much more difficult i'm deploying one

of these lists based policies because as

1083
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:04,650
it turns out there's a lot of stuff on

1084

1093
00:38:20,489 --> 00:38:24,180

these if you're responsible for a

website at all and you want to defend

1113
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:06,420
start kind of running out of space on a

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google acog it seems pretty simple</font>

00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:28,979
a mechanism called announced that allows

1123
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:30,279
you to whitelist a specific script not

1124
00:39:28,979 --> 00:39:31,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">by origin but by</font>

saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I meant for the script to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be on</font>

1126
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,190
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> page so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a token that you</font>

1127

1128
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,840
ABC and then that token is reflective in

1129
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,640
your page as part of the script tag so

1130
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,770
if the tutor things match and you're

1131
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing a good job of rotating the tokens</font>

1132
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:49,120
and generating a new token every time a

1133
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,980
number used once then you can actually

1134
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">verify that this script is the script</font>

1135
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,150
that you wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run because you knew</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok an attacker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are trying to inject</font>

open is therefore not able to execute

1139
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,580
scripts the smart folks on the Google

1140
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,350
security team<font color="#E5E5E5"> has put together a set of</font>

1141
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,509
guidelines for what they're calling a

1142
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:10,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">strict CSP and it's a certain on Stacy</font>

1143
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:13,090
SD the idea here is that you use these

1144
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:15,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">noises in or it's a whitelist and or to</font>

1145
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:17,050
allow specific script elements on your

1146
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,790
age<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then you grant those script</font>

1147
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,410
elements the authority to load<font color="#E5E5E5"> news</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fair</font>

1148
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:22,870
so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called strip</font>

1149
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:27,430
dynamic and CSP three that allows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1150
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:29,770
kind of give give power to the scripts

1151
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,540
that you load to load more scripts and

1152
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,680
this actually is pretty interesting

1153
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,480
because it gives you kind of a loader

1154
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,770
mechanism where you verify the loader

1155
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,570
script and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say well my loader</font>

1156
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:40,450
script can load stop say let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it load</font>

1157
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:42,640
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> this turns out to be a really</font>

1158
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:44,109
good way of employing CSP<font color="#E5E5E5"> and making it</font>

1159
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,990
much less fragile than these kind of

1160
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,760
origin based lists because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you are</font>

1163
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:55,120

maps is going to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just say max</font>

1165
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,200
please do your thing you trust the

1166
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,270
script and you allow that script to to

1167
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,350
load the various resource abilities so

1168
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,420
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're at all interested in deploying</font>

1176
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,259
actually I get up I also know that

1177
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,540
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called sub resource</font>

1178
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,700
integrity and as you notice the moment

00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,040
ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> comment security policy is generally</font>

origin origin please give me script it

1182
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:35,800
is the case however that CD and get

00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">hacked jquery CDN was hacked a number of</font>

times<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

1186
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,720
integrity which i think is interesting

1187
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:44,270
the idea here is that it gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font>

1188
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,589
content-based mechanism of saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

1189
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,330
to load the script I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> load a</font>

1190
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,190
script<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this origin but I also want</font>

1191
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:51,440
the script to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be exactly the script that</font>

1192
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,480
I think it is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sent the script up to</font>

1193
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,970
my CDN I take a hash of that script

1194
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,430
shots will shop 256 or buds ball or

1195
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:00,620
whatever and I reflect that hash in an

1196
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,990
integrity attribute within the script

1197
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,460
element on the page and this allows the

1198
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:07,459
browser to say okay I'm gonna download

1199
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,470
and then I'll verify it will make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

1200
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,480
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this content actually matches the</font>

1201
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:13,100
content you subscribe the integrity and

1202
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you do this then you get a</font>

1203
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,569
content-based check to verify not only

1204
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you're executing scripts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in Georgia</font>

1205
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:22,540
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually the scripted you want</font>

1206
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:25,160
in CSP three we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to layer</font>

1207
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,380
hatches on top of some resources a group

1208
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,560
so kind of security policy will verify

1209
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,840
the hashes that you that you list first

1210
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,490
specific script and then some resource

1211
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,770
integrity will verify that those hatchet

1212
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:40,520
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> match the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> content this gives</font>

1213
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:42,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you a content-based mechanism allowing a</font>

1214
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,490
specific strip to execute on your page

1215
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,810
which i think is gonna be really

1216
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,129
powerful especially for these kind of

1217
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:48,230
loader mechanism but we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1218
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,870
where you say I trust this script and

1219
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:54,470
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only trust this script not just</font>

1220
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:56,240
any script of this order we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a</font>

1221
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:59,149
number of changes to cookies over time

1222
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,549
it cookies are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one of the large</font>

1223
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:04,610
mistakes that we made with designing the

1224
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:06,020
web it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really unfortunate that cookies</font>

1225
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:07,910
have a completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different security</font>

1226
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,620
model than everything else so generally

1227
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">speaking we have an origin base security</font>

1228
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,549
model let me say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this origin is</font>

1229
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:15,080
responsible for itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not for</font>

1230
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,400
anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it should have access</font>

1231
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">to anything else that should have to</font>

1232
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,970
request things from other origins it

1233
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:23,480
should just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gain access my cookies</font>

1234
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:27,259
however kind of brutal origins down to

1235
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,670
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective TLD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> +1 so you have comm</font>

1236
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:31,280
with the TLD he and then you buy

1237

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm so something calm is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1239
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,680
like appspot com and appspot com in

1240
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,570
itself is kind of a TLD so we treated

1241
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">differently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than we treat something like</font>

1242
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:46,910
exam tomorrow so cookies have power up

1243
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the effective top-level domain so you</font>

is kind of all lumped into the same pile

1249
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:03,390
there are a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we'd</font>

1250
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:05,460
like to do to to change cookies to make

1251
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,750
them slightly less terrible at least in

1252
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,600
terms of its security properties a

1253
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:11,610
couple of those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are here so same</font>

1254
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:14,069
side cookies is the thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm most</font>

1257
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,090
another folks are interested the idea is

1258
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,950
that instead of allowing the user agent

1259
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:25,800
to make authenticated requests on your

1260
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,000
behalf anywhere that website wants which

1261
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,700
enables things like cross-site request

1262
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,100
forgery of X you can specify that a

1263
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:34,799
specific cookie is same site that is I

1264
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,450
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send myself this cookie but if</font>

1265
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,160
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else initiates the request the</font>

1266
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,350
cookie<font color="#CCCCCC"> shouldn't be set so you can</font>

1267
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,440
imagine a session serving for instance

1268
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:46,920
that is set to be a same site group that

1269
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,930
is if example calm sets the cookie great

1270
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,320
if example<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm makes a request to</font>

1271
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:54,839
example like hi great but if example

1272
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,490
calm I'm sorry if evil calm makes your

1273
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,900
request to example calm then you

1274
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:00,330
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> find that cookie a long way</font>

1275
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:03,000
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending that cookie will trick</font>

1276
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,740
can trick the server into gating the

1277
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,750
request and saying no this is totally

1278
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the user I think we should you know</font>

1279
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:09,360
transfer all their money to the evil on

1280
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,419

1281
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:15,510
reasonable to do so same side cookies

1282
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:18,840
give you the ability to lock a cookie to

1283
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:20,310
a specific sites contacts<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can I can</font>

1284
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,230
make requests to myself so whenever I

1285
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:24,570
call my own API they should totally work

1286
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,770
but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else calls my AP is you're</font>

1287
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,780
not going to deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cookie and</font>

00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,190
because you don't deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> this it's</font>

1289
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,690
relatively straightforward for the

1290
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:32,070

00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,640
there's a wax attribute or relax value

you go through the checkout flow so

00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:35,910
there's kind of two levels of access the

and can show you a reasonable rendering

1325
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,060
to give you the information you're

secure attribute that I mentioned

1403
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,020
earlier so secure has been around for a

1404
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,700
really long time but it doesn't act it

1405
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:28,160
hasn't actually given you much guarantee

1406
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,410
of security because secure cookies could

1407

secure should mean that it's only sent

1419
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:58,730
from a secure website from a secure

1420
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,650
origin and it can't be modified by a

1421
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:02,300
non-secure urge this also means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1422
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:04,250
we've changed the eviction policies your

1423
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,380
cookies so it says non-secure cookies

1424
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:08,390
are evicted before security so if you

1425
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:10,970
have a non-secure origin you shouldn't

1435
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:33,930
to think that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

thing that cookies usually do which is

authentication it is incredibly

1439
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:43,230
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we stop session because</font>

1440
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:45,960
fishing is one of the huge user facing

1441
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:48,630
problems that even if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> solved all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1442
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,430
technical stuff fishing is going to

00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,960
force people to give up their passwords

1444
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:53,848
and that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be problematic in</font>

1445
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,560
terms of authentication we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with</font>

problem it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great if people</font>

1449
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:02,670
would use house advantages because

1450
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:04,470
concert managers make it possible if you

1451
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:06,630
not to reuse passwords across every

1452
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:08,098
website if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just fished on google com</font>

1453
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:10,740
you don't automatically go up<font color="#E5E5E5"> your da</font>

1454
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:12,660
blue dots work as well one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

1455
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do this is by allowing websites to</font>

1456
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:16,109
integrate more fully with the bathroom

1457
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,450
so the credential management API tries

1458
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:20,520
to do this where we say the website can

1459
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,529
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> credentials from the passive editor</font>

1460
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,150
can ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them directly and if the</font>

1461
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,589
user is set themselves up in such a way

1462
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,730
that they want to automatically log<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

1463
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:28,440
their website they'll never<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a</font>

1464
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,060
password form again I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1465
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,250
be a much better world than because of

1466
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,779
today so if the password manager knows

1467
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,460
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> counselor and you configured your</font>

1468
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,260
browser to automatically sign you in

1469
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,760
then when you go to the website it'll

1470
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask credential you'll give it to the</font>

1471
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,609
website and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you'll automatically be</font>

1472
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,589
signed it without actually having to

1473
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:46,098
interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain or at all the</font>

1474
00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:48,119
goal is that over time it should become

1475
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:49,740
dangerous for a user to type in a

1476
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:52,500
password themselves and we should be

1477
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to slowly iterate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> toward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

1478
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:57,329
where passwords are not something that

1479
00:51:54,930 --> 00:52:02,759
users see but instead something that is

1480
00:51:57,329 --> 00:52:04,140
mediated<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the user agent building</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1481
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,400
top of that it would be great if we

1482
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,810
could get<font color="#CCCCCC"> rid of password vault together</font>

1483
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,329
because passwords are terrible right

1484
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:12,119
it'd be really nice if we could start

1485
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:14,970
using things like security keys how many

1486
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:16,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you have a security key okay</font>

1487
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:18,660
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone should be raising our</font>

1488
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,890
hands because it's incredibly important

1489
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,629
if you use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google accounts of you to</font>

drop out to talent or github account for

1491
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:25,650
anything along those lines these are a

1492
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,260
facebook they all support second factor

1493
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:30,180
authentication and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security key is</font>

1494
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:32,160
something that gives you really good

1495
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,980
security properties in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1496
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,830
anti-phishing that is

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do evil calm it is impossible for</font>

evil calm to respond to a challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1499
00:52:39,859 --> 00:52:45,080
the same way as good calm the token will

1500
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,910
basically generates a public/private key

1501
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,220
pair it will send the public key up to

1502
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:51,500
the server and then next time the server

1503
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:52,700
asks for something you verify that you

1504
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,800
have the same key that you had before

1505
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:57,680
thank you verify key persistence every

1506
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">time and by setting up by setting that</font>

1507
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,640
up you can actually really good

1508
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,290
guarantees that you're actually talking

1509
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,879
to the use of you expect to be talking

1510
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:09,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so something you know something you</font>

1511
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:13,869
have black ass URL<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn like as qrl um</font>

1512
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:17,930
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the idea here is that your</font>

1513
00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:22,609
hardware device so the sturdiness of the

1514
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:25,990
hospital SQL us girls okay cheers p I

1515
00:53:22,609 --> 00:53:31,490
don't know okay sorry um<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1516
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:34,430
authentication mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um program</font>

1517
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:36,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">driver wrong it's really interesting we</font>

1518
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:39,379
should talk yeah yeah no I'm curious I

1519
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:43,060
think that the reason I bet you're

1520
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:46,100
certain securities is because there are

1521
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:48,500
deployments today and we're building an

1522
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,850
API for the browser and my hope is it

1523
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,960
will build this on top of the credential

1524
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:53,060
matter today guys we just talked about

1525
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that developers will have kind of a</font>

1531
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:08,180
where developers can go to kind of get

1533
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:12,379
something that allows websites to turn

00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:14,779
things off so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future policy is like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a sheet before the various ap is that</font>

1536
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:18,740
you have on a website if you know that

00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use geolocation why</font>

1538
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:23,270
allow yourself to have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

1539
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:24,830
location so it kind of works in a

1540
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:27,109
similar way to the sandbox mechanisms

1541
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:29,359
that you see on various<font color="#E5E5E5"> medic systems</font>

1542
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:31,130
where you say this process is going to

00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:33,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">do some stuff we're not going to talk to</font>

1544
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:33,950
the network so don't even let<font color="#E5E5E5"> us talk to</font>

1545
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,890
that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> or they tried to talk to</font>

really interesting performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> aspects</font>

1551
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,950
because if you know you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

use<font color="#CCCCCC"> document</font>

00:54:52,849 --> 00:54:56,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">amazing spare so does really interesting</font>

1558
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,618
performance benefits but it also has

1559
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:59,480
really bad security events because you

1560
00:54:57,619 --> 00:55:01,760
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually turn off surface area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,810
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is an original policy we've</font>

1564
00:55:06,589 --> 00:55:09,950
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot apologies and it</font>

1565
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,779
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice if you didn't have</font>

1566
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:13,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to deliver each of them individually on</font>

1567
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:16,040
every website right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're all</font>

1568
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:17,868
HTTP headers origin policy tries to

1569
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,390
unify these into a single manifest file

1570
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:22,070
under origin that sets off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

1571
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:23,990
properties and sets up other properties

1572
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:25,640
as well for your words so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance i</font>

1573
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:26,868
talked about chords earlier and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1574
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,490
suggested that there's these cores

1575
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:29,839
pre-flight that basically verified if

1576
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:31,578
you actually speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> cores and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

1577
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,960
understand what's going on it would be

1578
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:34,310
nice if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just assert that you</font>

1579
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,640
understand what's going on so we could

1580
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:40,160
remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these transitory and not</font>

1581
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:41,868
valuable requests for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lac so origin</font>

1582
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,210
policy might be a way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing where we</font>

1583
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:45,710
assert in a secure way that I understand

00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:47,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">cores please stop sending me these pre</font>

00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:49,940
flights just<font color="#CCCCCC"> take me to course request</font>

1586
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:51,650
i'll totally verify my story it also

1587
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:53,210
would allow you to pin things like

1588
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:55,760
common security qualities and instead of

1589

1593
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:06,290
every time those are responsible about

1594
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this has some really interesting</font>

1595
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,730
properties I think we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably be</font>

1596
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,109
able to merge it in some way with the

1597
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:13,190
application manifest that browsers you

00:56:12,109 --> 00:56:16,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">do today because you things like</font>

1599
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:17,420
installation or home screen and I'm

1600
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:20,450
producing the properties<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was going</font>

1601
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:23,660
to happen I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> last that was entirely</font>

1602
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:24,950
wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> sub origin there's a thing called</font>

1603
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,480
an origin that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about earlier</font>

1604
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:28,939
and the origin is kind of the core of

1605
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,310
security policy on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web it would be</font>

1606
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:33,260
really nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> however if especially for</font>

1607
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:35,089
large origin to contain on bulk to your

1608
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:37,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">applications so google com is a good</font>

1609
00:56:35,089 --> 00:56:40,279
example of this you have ducks you have

1610
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:42,230
mail you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> mass and all of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1611
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,730
separate application code by separate

1612
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">team that shouldn't have access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to each</font>

1613
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:47,390
other's data and yes they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all on</font>

1614
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:49,400
google com and therefore share a lot of

1615
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:51,710
resources share a lot of responsibility

1616
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,300
but also share a lot of authority if you

1617
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:56,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get somehow shard this</font>

1618
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,310
origin into a variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sub origins and</font>

1619
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:58,830
basically

1620
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:01,690
the privileges that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing to each</font>

1621
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:03,880
to each page and the page and hit a

1622
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:06,850
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I'm a docs sub origin I'm</font>

1623
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:09,070
totally not actually google com please

1624
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,360
treat me different this has some pretty

1625
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,770
interesting properties we're still kind

1626
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,720
of working out what exactly it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1627
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:15,009
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a sub origin we have an</font>

1628
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,600
implementation of the current draft

1629
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">synchro so the great if you could play</font>

1630
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and going to give us some</font>

1631
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">feedback as to whether or not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1632
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,760
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the right direction but this is</font>

1633
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:23,320
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting area to explore</font>

1634
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,240
because it gives you the ability to

1635
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:27,700
reduce the privilege of a particular

1636
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:31,180
page protecting the other applications

1637
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:32,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">on your org from prudential badness so</font>

1638
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:36,190
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at like google.com we have</font>

1639
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,600
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like zeitgeist from 2007 this is</font>

1640
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,250
not written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a secure way it was</font>

1641
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,900
written by third parties but we haven't

1642
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked at it in a long time it did great</font>

1643
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,970
if we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> show that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off in some way</font>

1644
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:50,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">without</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1645
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:52,600
isolated origins is a similar to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sub</font>

1646
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">versions but the properties of then</font>

1647
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,330
you're going to be different you want to

1648
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,830
actually lock your side down so they

1649
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:59,680
can't talk to other side those eyes

1650
00:57:56,830 --> 00:58:02,170
can't talk to it there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are these things</font>

1651
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,370
called chrome applications so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chrome</font>

1652
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:05,070
OS for instance you'll have an

1653
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:07,450
application that shows an HTML page

1654
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:08,920
we're killing from applications for a

1655
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,990
variety of reasons mostly because the

1656
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,060
back to the web but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replace</font>

1657
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:14,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">them with something that is Webbie but</font>

1658
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:16,029
gives you the same isolation properties

1659
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,080
so you have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own creepy jar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1660
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,550
not making requests<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

1661
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,710
authenticated things along these lines

1662
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:22,450
we're also this is very exploratory so

1663
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,860
ideas here would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be welcome but we're</font>

1664
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:25,299
kind of trying to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it</font>

1665
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:29,860
would mean for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> origin to really</font>

1666
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:33,190
isolate itself some rest away so with

1667
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:35,290
that one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it stopped every</font>

1668
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:37,810
time I come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conference and look out</font>

1669
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:41,259
and I look up the stage and everyone

1670
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:44,049
looks like me we are all white we all

1671
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:46,470
are losing our hair many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1672
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:49,480
beards or older than they used to be and

1673
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:51,609
it's kind of sad I really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

1674
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:56,320
more diversity both covers<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like</font>

1675
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:58,620
this but also in our work and<font color="#CCCCCC"> our lives</font>

1676
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:01,240
I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunate that the</font>

1677
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:03,130
culture that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've built for whatever</font>

1678
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:05,080
reasons has made it harder<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> harder</font>

1679
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:07,900
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that don't look like me to be</font>

1680
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:09,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">successful I think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and one</font>

1681
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,900
of the answers but it's something I'm

1682
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:24,038
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a lot and</font>

1683
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:26,020
I the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about as well and with</font>

1684
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:30,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're opening the stage for a few</font>

1685
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions and I have been frightened for</font>

1686
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:37,240
any volunteers exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe 11</font>

1687
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:40,319
general question to me what you're

1688
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:44,799
talking about it at adding features

1689
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:48,339
either there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not much we saw hd2</font>

1690
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:51,309
developing a new stuff it isn't a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tender</font>

1691
00:59:48,339 --> 00:59:56,950
wait how are the view what they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> poke</font>

1692
00:59:51,309 --> 00:59:58,809
me is there anything but like HDD 30 or

1693
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:00,788
something that your district focusing at

1694
00:59:58,809 --> 01:00:04,299
with adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the features to make</font>

1695
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:07,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and it's worth it on the web so the</font>

1696
01:00:04,299 --> 01:00:14,319
most negative lately opportunity you

1697
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:16,390
make like this way you're good yeah I

1698
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,160
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of folks so first let's</font>

1699
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,900
say the HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> two is great and you should</font>

1700
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,118
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

1701
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:24,730
hdds like no browser is employed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over</font>

1702
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:26,289
HTTP which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful there are new</font>

1703
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:27,630
protocols that are coming out so quick

1704
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:30,010
is one of them where the team is

1705
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:31,599
experimenting with UDP is because TCP

1706
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,890
connection they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting some really</font>

1707
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,579
good properties especially for things

1708
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:37,779
like video so yes they're working on new

1709
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">networking center but I think your</font>

1710
01:00:37,779 --> 01:00:42,220
question is actually whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can set</font>

1711
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:45,160
a new baseline so a good example of this

1712
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:48,160
is the the quirks mode versus standards

1713
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:50,170
mode for HTML where you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> old HTML</font>

1714
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,930
pages that are relying on rear behaviors

1715
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:57,010
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided we didn't want anymore</font>

1716
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:58,538
and browser vendors a belated as they

1717
01:00:57,010 --> 01:01:00,430
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the doc type of the document and</font>

1718
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:01,539
said okay this is an old lock type we're

1719
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:04,149
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this crazy old rendering</font>

1720
01:01:01,539 --> 01:01:06,420
mode this is the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc type so we're</font>

1721
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:09,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use the nice new standard mode</font>

1722
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:12,010
render mechanism that's really expensive

1723
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:13,089
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really expensive both in terms of</font>

1724
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:14,829
maintenance because now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1725
01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:17,078
maintain two paths but it's also really

1726
01:01:14,829 --> 01:01:18,430
expensive in terms of helping developers

1727
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:20,049
understand what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're</font>

1728
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:22,839
kind of locking ourselves into<font color="#CCCCCC"> backward</font>

1729
01:01:20,049 --> 01:01:23,360
compatible it would be nice if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

1730
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:26,210
figure

1731
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:28,550
to not need to be backwards compatible

1732
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:30,890
with api's if you don't like because

1733
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:32,390
generally speaking if their<font color="#CCCCCC"> API is you</font>

1734
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:34,640
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> likes then the attackers will use</font>

1735
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:36,440
them and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out ways of</font>

1736
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,480
actually turning them off either by

1737
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chilean entirely from the web or by</font>

1738
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,870
giving developers the ability to turn

1739
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:45,640
them all themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing we've been</font>

1740
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:48,980
thinking about is the notion of a like

1741
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:50,629
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> mode where you say you send the</font>

1742
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:54,230
head<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to send please make me secure</font>

1743
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:56,030
one and maybe over time that turns

1744
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:57,440
embassies make me security<font color="#E5E5E5"> or please</font>

1745
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:59,420
make me secure three<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have just</font>

1746
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,340
like a different set of settings that we

1747
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:04,460
apply to a page based on the movies

1748
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:06,350
you've opted into I think that's a

1749
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:08,990
totally reasonable thing to explore but

1750
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:12,049
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really clear to me what we can</font>

1751
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:14,000
do in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of in a simple toggle</font>

1752
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:16,490
sort of way that really improve security

1753
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,170
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website some things are</font>

1754
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:19,430
relatively straightforward life turning

01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:21,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">out document right that would have</font>

1756
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:23,270
really nice and thoughts other things

1757
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">are more difficult like setting up a</font>

1758
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:27,259
common security policy is generally

1759
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,490
requires a lot of server-side changes

1760
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:30,560
and requires you to really understand

1761
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:33,379
the application so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would love for</font>

1762
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:36,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">there to be a new mode for the web that</font>

1763

just turns a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things off trying to</font>

1764
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:44,840
contours of that is is is difficult but

1765
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:48,080
I think a worthwhile effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

1767
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:55,690
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it's not one in so long honey</font>

1768
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:59,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah I understand Alton</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way like don'twe</font>

1769
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:03,440
going forward and marketing pages that

<font color="#E5E5E5">did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you stop me is devil Secutor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buzz</font>

1771
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:10,130
you just better<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so what were there</font>

1772
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,459
are two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> here first really</font>

1773
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:16,040
importantly in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those cases we</font>

1774
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:18,740
end up using users as a cudgel against

1775
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:21,170
the website and hitting a website with

1776
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:23,029
their users makes the website change but

1777
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:25,340
also kind of makes the user sad because

1778
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:28,340
they're also getting hits in this

1779
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:31,310
process so<font color="#CCCCCC"> she'll one depredation is a</font>

1780
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:33,620
good example of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> where when large</font>

1781
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:34,560
websites you shall once we can't turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1782
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:37,290
off without making you

1783
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:39,330
and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting balance</font>

1784
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:41,190
that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find between making</font>

1785
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:43,290
users sad and making websites change and

1786
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:46,290
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found that yet I</font>

1787
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:49,620
think we're still figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how far</font>

1788
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:51,870
we can do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these kinds of</font>

1789
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:54,810
changes improve security but at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1790
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:56,850
expense of user happiness and kind of

1791
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:58,529
the end goal increases be happy on the

1792
01:03:56,850 --> 01:03:59,610
web and to be doing good<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and we</font>

1793
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:03,090
want them to be secure while they're

1794
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:04,920
doing it but we can't take security<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1795
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:06,930
absolute like it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great if we</font>

1796
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,370
just turned off<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of 80 eyes but</font>

1797
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:10,790
doing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> would break lots of websites</font>

1798
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:15,569
and finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> your balance there is</font>

1799
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:17,460
difficult and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we saw one</font>

1800
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:19,410
last short question and afterwards

you're welcome to continue discussing

you'll find my<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrel there's a very</font>

lot of support rate their universe I'm

1817
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:13,560
just again do you know what are there

1818
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:17,009
any efforts underway to detect bad

1819

<font color="#E5E5E5">taste yeah so specific</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a threat sparrin</font>

1821
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:23,730
see is the the big fat that we're making

1822
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:25,380
Todd trying to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going</font>

01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:27,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">on where you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system still good</font>

1824
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:29,040
transparency it's basically a mechanism

1825
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:31,859
of forcing certificates to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulling</font>

1826
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:34,080
and we use the magic block chain and

1827
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:35,950
then everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that it right so you</font>

1828
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,390
have a block chain of

1829
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:39,430
certificates and you said and you can

1830
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:42,490
verifiably prove that the certificate

1831
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:45,009
was given to you at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point and we're</font>
