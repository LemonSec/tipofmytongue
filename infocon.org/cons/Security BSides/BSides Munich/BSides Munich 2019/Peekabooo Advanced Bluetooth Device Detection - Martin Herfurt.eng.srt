1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,490
thank you very much Martin thanks for

2
00:00:04,979 --> 00:00:10,890
having me thanks for being here so this

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,500
is about Bluetooth or let's say advanced

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:20,429
Bluetooth device detection and it's

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:23,009
called peekaboo so Who am I I'm a finder

6
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:26,640
of the trifle net group I'm professional

7
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:29,939
services member of the team member of

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,060
the Greenville networks company who is a

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,309
vendor of

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,859
vulnerability management solutions and

11
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,108
there's my own company so and it turns

12
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,449
out like my whole life my whole

13
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,820
professional life seems to revolve

14
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:48,300
around like colored party parts

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,800
it's like Bluetooth green bone and red

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,800
eyes we know that right

17
00:00:52,910 --> 00:01:01,108
so what is gonna happen within this talk

18
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:04,349
so first we I will give you a very short

19
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,180
very superficial Bluetooth technology

20
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,030
overview we're not here to talk about

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,270
tech details today this is a very

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,610
low-level talk just to get people who

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,880
are interested started with low effort

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,720
right hmm then I will talk about

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,380
Bluetooth security like the last 20

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,310
years maybe like given a very

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:31,350
superficial overview here and then to

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,660
the core of the talk Bluetooth device

29
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,770
discovery at at the end of the talk I

30
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,259
will present project peekaboo to you all

31
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,470
right

32
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,930
[Music]

33
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,880
so the situation at the moment Joe just

34
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,420
raise your hand if you have a Bluetooth

35
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,280
device with you or Bluetooth enabled

36
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:55,920
there so it's pretty much everybody and

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:59,070
who didn't turn bluetooth on not just

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,080
for this talk but in general who did it

39
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,050
not turn on raise your hands

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,330
all right so it's half of you there's a

41
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:10,318
statistics out there that I just dug up

42
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:13,170
yesterday it says 20% of all Europeans

43
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,769
turn on their Bluetooth usually in the

44
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,140
States is 40%

45
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,880
but I guess do all this new technology

46
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,809
coming up like variables like

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:25,240
smartwatches people will increasingly

48
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,550
turn their Bluetooth on which is good

49
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,370
and bad in a way

50
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:34,240
well there's worldwide 10 billion

51
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:37,030
Bluetooth enabled devices whereas a big

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,250
portion of them are smartphones and of

53
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:42,010
course cars to have all Bluetooth and

54
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,980
bluetooth it the Bluetooth sick

55
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,540
themselves says that audio streaming for

56
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,950
Bluetooth is like the killer application

57
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,570
so everybody or many many people use

58
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:56,310
bluetooth to stream their audio from

59
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:59,170
their phones to their headsets and

60
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,910
there's new fields of adoption coming up

61
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:05,619
so there's a lot and we will hear about

62
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:07,960
medical devices today as well and with

63
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,150
the advent of Bluetooth Low Energy or

64
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,940
what the Bluetooth SIG is calling it

65
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,830
like Bluetooth smart there's a lot of

66
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,859
new application fields in the medical

67
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,380
sector and of course there's the

68
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,810
Internet of Things where this new

69
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,829
feature mesh networking functionality

70
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:29,260
which is included in Bluetooth 5.0 and

71
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,980
recently 5.1 got released so there's a

72
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:38,980
lot of features targeting the the IOT

73
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:41,589
market so there's more to come and as

74
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:47,049
said this is very superficial so in the

75
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:50,470
early 2000s we had like a few profile

76
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:53,170
based attacks same some protocol

77
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,150
specific things these were the things or

78
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,160
these were the times when the trifle

79
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,260
night group which I'm a member or

80
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,980
founding member of did a lot of

81
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,670
Bluetooth security work and of course we

82
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,399
were not the only ones later on we had

83
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:13,420
like company Michael Osmond for example

84
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,430
who entered the field by SDR sniffing

85
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,010
Bluetooth traffic I will mention him

86
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,459
once more today and also Dominic's bill

87
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:24,340
and and his colleague mark and in the

88
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,979
early 2010's Reid we saw a lot of

89
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,719
protocol attacks but very recently we

90
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:30,789
see a lot of

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,130
very down to the chip based attacks

92
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,220
which are very sophisticated and require

93
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:42,880
a lot of knowledge about hardware and

94
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:46,030
everything hmm and just to pick a few

95
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,820
highlights there was the blue Bourne

96
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:52,179
attack in 2017 which I found to be

97
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,430
really harsh why is that because it was

98
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,180
a buffer overflow of vulnerability in

99
00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:00,100
the l2 cap protocol which basically

100
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,640
every Bluetooth classic device is using

101
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,600
and it was used or it was there in the

102
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,740
kind of reference implementation and

103
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,650
everybody was vulnerable to this

104
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:16,120
specific issue which allowed code

105
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:17,890
execution on the target device and this

106
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,780
was so to me

107
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:22,419
where I was like away from the Bluetooth

108
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,919
topic this was just a shocker for me to

109
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:27,280
see that this is still out there and

110
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,140
nobody had to look at that before so and

111
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,820
what we see a lot especially with

112
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,650
Bluetooth Low Energy there's a lot of

113
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,169
devices out there that implement their

114
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,390
own kind of interface in order to talk

115
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,549
to apps and they're usually very poorly

116
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,979
implemented except you have like a brand

117
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,229
product where the reputation loss would

118
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,710
be damaging to the company selling this

119
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:52,810
product but usually of Chinese pastes

120
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:56,229
and manufacturers don't care a lot so

121
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:59,350
this all boils down to Bluetooth device

122
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:01,750
discovery so if you want to tinker with

123
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,419
the device that is Bluetooth enabled you

124
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:08,260
would first have to find it and back

125
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:11,500
then in the old days the Bluetooth

126
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,510
inquiry scan just did that you just turn

127
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,330
on your laptop and search for devices

128
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:19,450
and usually back then devices were all

129
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:22,000
visible and all being available to you

130
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,070
for you to connect to it and there's

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,770
even urban legend who has heard about

132
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:32,080
two things

133
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:35,650
all right so two thing was allegedly sex

134
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,130
dating in the metro or not Metro in the

135
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:42,248
subway of London so where people would

136
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:44,739
offer their their personal service via

137
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:46,689
Bluetooth name and people were just able

138
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:51,399
to find each other like on a

139
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:54,219
peer-to-peer fashion so I'm not sure if

140
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:57,879
this but was the reason for making

141
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:59,709
devices invisible by default but this is

142
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,419
the common standard now so if you have a

143
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:04,839
Bluetooth device it's most likely not

144
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:07,058
visible when you just turn it on you

145
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:09,279
will be able to take a to to switch it

146
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:11,169
to visible once you want to pair it to

147
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,729
another device and so on but usually

148
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:17,469
it's not visible anymore

149
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:23,529
so a lot less fun in the subway then mmm

150
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:25,929
and researchers came up with all kinds

151
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:28,869
of different methods for device

152
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:31,299
discovery but most of them are pretty

153
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:34,599
costly they need specialized talker or

154
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:37,659
at least they're not not very simple

155
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:39,759
setups usually you would have to have a

156
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:41,589
lot of knowledge about radio protocols

157
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,329
and sniffing them and so on

158
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:48,759
so you tooth is not easy to sniff hmm

159
00:07:46,329 --> 00:07:51,039
but before you learn about or we talk

160
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,289
about Bluetooth devices gallery we have

161
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,479
to know about that what it's all about

162
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:58,329
and it's all about the Bluetooth device

163
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:01,479
address for Bluetooth classic devices

164
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:03,879
which are like the old legacy version

165
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:06,758
devices of pluto's so there's six bytes

166
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:09,699
and they look alike like a MAC address

167
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:12,099
and they have six bytes like separated

168
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,809
by dashes or Collins and usually the

169
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:15,009
first three bytes of this address are

170
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:17,619
sorry

171
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:21,249
of this address are assigned by the oh

172
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:24,279
you eye table is like an I Triple E I

173
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:26,709
think it's I trophy and they collect and

174
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:29,889
sell these prefixes to companies who

175
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:35,469
want to produce Bluetooth devices and

176
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:39,579
also network devices and a Bluetooth

177
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:42,729
address is now built upon these six

178
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:45,729
bytes whereas the last three bytes are

179
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:50,309
the lower address part which are kind of

180
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,309
half of the address already and

181
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,520
but these are usually assigned by the

182
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:00,290
device manufacturers randomly and the

183
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,579
third byte from the left is the

184
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:07,219
so-called UAP the upper address part and

185
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,440
the two bytes to the very left are the

186
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,510
non significant address parts and we

187
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,370
learned later on that these are really

188
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:17,510
non significant to the Bluetooth

189
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:21,830
protocol all right so as mentioned

190
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:24,290
earlier there has been what I consider

191
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:27,350
the gold standard for Bluetooth device

192
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:30,140
discovery and this is detailed in the

193
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:33,830
talk from 2009 I think it was at DEFCON

194
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:36,140
17 it was called Bluetooth smells like

195
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:40,310
chicken and the approach they had there

196
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:42,319
was they calculated the hopping sequence

197
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,479
they were sniffing packets with

198
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:50,570
software-defined radio solutions like

199
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:53,270
here on the right which is the USRP new

200
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,550
radio kind of use RP is Atlas research

201
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:59,000
and of course nowadays there's all kinds

202
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:01,819
of devices like heck RF and then burr

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,440
tooth and yacht stick from great Scot

204
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:08,450
gadgets I mean what they did was pretty

205
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,610
complicated in a way that you would have

206
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,500
to have at least some of these hardware

207
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:16,520
components and of course you would have

208
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,560
to understand the protocol so the method

209
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,500
they used was very sophisticated and

210
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:25,069
it's it's available on github I guess so

211
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:30,440
it's it's like easy to replicate it but

212
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:33,050
still you need a lot and I thought like

213
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,090
two years ago or two and a half years

214
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,390
ago I thought there should be an easier

215
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:41,870
approach to sniffing or to discovering

216
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:44,330
Bluetooth devices and because there was

217
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:48,500
almost ten years of no improvement in

218
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,580
this field and but the chicken method

219
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,800
has some downsides

220
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,920
so the Bluetooth interface you want to

221
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,709
discover has to be communicating duh and

222
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,229
of course it's a very complicated setup

223
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,180
and it takes these people out of the

224
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,820
equation that just want to play with

225
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,630
Bluetooth and maybe find some other

226
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,810
devices

227
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:13,790
round in order to send them something so

228
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:15,709
this is kind of high profile and as

229
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,780
there's a worldwide trend going on at

230
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,790
the moment we see that in the USA like

231
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,250
everywhere in politics there's a big

232
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:25,490
dumbing down effect currently taking

233
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,930
place and that's why I started in the

234
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,510
late 2016

235
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:32,719
that's when Trump was elected I also

236
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,760
started dumbing down stuff myself I mean

237
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,160
so the the goal was to find a less

238
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:43,520
sophisticated cheaper way to discover

239
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:46,520
Bluetooth devices and this is not about

240
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:49,189
esoteric sorry to say that but it's

241
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,110
about duality so the core idea of

242
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:56,120
discovering Bluetooth devices with

243
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:58,580
peekaboo is that usually devices share

244
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,460
the same sock so Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is

245
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:04,550
on the same chip that means that the UI

246
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:07,400
o UI ID in the beginning of the device

247
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:10,099
address usually is the same as for other

248
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:15,380
interfaces on this device same vendor

249
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:18,680
same o UI prefix right hmm and so

250
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:24,850
knowing the Wi-Fi MAC obviously is

251
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,849
knowing 50% of the PD device address and

252
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,450
then again you have the random 3 bytes

253
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:35,900
which often have an offset from the

254
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:39,350
Wi-Fi MAC which is constant not all the

255
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:42,350
times feds often so knowing the offset

256
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,420
of that Wi-Fi to make it was a MAC

257
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:48,800
address to Pediatrics offset it's like

258
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,870
guessing the other 50% and there was

259
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,170
even a mention in the book from from an

260
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:57,620
old friends in 2015 Joshua Wright wrote

261
00:12:54,170 --> 00:13:00,110
Cove Road hacking exposed wireless and

262
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,650
he's mentioning that Apple iPhones

263
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:08,060
usually you have an offset offer 1:1

264
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:10,160
offset in the address so starting with

265
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,589
this so this was around the time where

266
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,600
it was popular to to see all the Wi-Fi

267
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:17,390
probe requests and collect them I

268
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,290
thought well everybody is telling me

269
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:22,220
there

270
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:25,099
their wife iMac so what can I do with

271
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:28,430
that and I tell you what I did I I went

272
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,850
to all kinds of retailer stores and dip

273
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:34,660
pictures off the device next to the the

274
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,490
sign like the the vendor sign and

275
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,469
usually it's it's saying the MAC address

276
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,060
of the Wi-Fi and the Bluetooth the

277
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,310
address once you have turned it on you

278
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:47,030
can see both of these addresses I snap

279
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:51,829
pictures and edit those informations to

280
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:55,490
my own spreadsheet and see what I

281
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:58,760
discovered so the address offsets are

282
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:02,240
for the majority of devices like very

283
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:06,590
small so we have like to the one hand a

284
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,080
very high offset sometimes but you see

285
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:16,250
these vendors in the middle Huawei Apple

286
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:19,010
Samsung these are like almost all of

287
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:23,240
them are in this very certain area of

288
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:27,200
offsets and then again you see the

289
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:31,700
market share by manufacturers so this

290
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:34,400
shows what the major headset a handset

291
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:38,720
manufacturers are and you can see that

292
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:42,500
Samsung Huawei and Apple is just among

293
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,270
the three top vendors what does that

294
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,420
mean

295
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:49,460
that means it's easy for a lot of

296
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:53,300
devices out there to guess what the

297
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:57,650
offset is so and so to speak how to find

298
00:14:53,300 --> 00:15:00,530
the the Bluetooth address and I used to

299
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:04,910
have a one plus three which had a zero

300
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:07,880
offset from Mac to wife sorry from Wi-Fi

301
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:11,600
to Bluetooth which i think is not even

302
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:14,689
legal Apple usually uses minus one so if

303
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,080
you subtract the Bluetooth address from

304
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:23,930
the Wi-Fi address and Huawei has some

305
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:26,540
odd values here like minus 2500 one 2001

306
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:29,089
three thousand one so it's like not

307
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:32,290
random right these are classes of

308
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,389
offsets Samsung uses minus one

309
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:37,779
but there's something ugly I will talk

310
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:40,660
about here so sometimes devices do have

311
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:43,449
different Oh UI IDs so I called this

312
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,059
address space entanglements because like

313
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:49,719
the one part like the Wi-Fi MAC has the

314
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:52,149
left oh UI keys and on the right side

315
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,279
you see the oh you I ID off the

316
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,799
Bluetooth address so in in some cases

317
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,079
this is not the same address and I'm not

318
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,559
really sure why this is so maybe this is

319
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:04,809
because of manufacturing logistics or

320
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,269
maybe it's because I usually photograph

321
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:09,999
new devices that were in the shelves

322
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:11,919
just recently so maybe the manufacturers

323
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:14,339
were just having small batches of

324
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:19,359
productions and we're using up like old

325
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:21,459
orphaned MAC addresses there I don't

326
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:23,829
really know the reason for that but it

327
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:28,289
happens it's not the majority but still

328
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:28,289
you find like these entanglements a lot

329
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:39,189
so the new task is not to find Bluetooth

330
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:42,749
addresses anymore the new task is to

331
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:45,969
find Wi-Fi MAC address MAC addresses and

332
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:48,279
usually this is easier there's known

333
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,819
approaches to that it's it's Wi-Fi

334
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:54,119
probes send out all kinds of devices

335
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:57,039
that you can collect it's it's using

336
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:59,769
Ehrmann next generation where you can

337
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,999
also sniff into encrypted networks to

338
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:08,199
see the MAC addresses being used there

339
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:10,769
it's by using oh by just connecting to

340
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,539
puppy public Wi-Fi hotspots where

341
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:19,089
everybody is able to see everybody else

342
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:22,299
or by running a rogue access point with

343
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:27,069
a well known SSID for example like

344
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:30,730
Google guest psk you could try that all

345
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:32,620
the devices who that know this SSID will

346
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:37,510
connect and so you will get their MAC

347
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:40,000
address in return and collecting non

348
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,919
random IP version 6 local link addresses

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,510
also would work because these

350
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,559
non-randomized versions of these

351
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:50,749
addresses contain also the

352
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:52,428
address of the interface so there is

353
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:54,350
existing countermeasures against

354
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:58,429
collecting Wi-Fi MAC addresses and

355
00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:01,490
usually you find them in Android devices

356
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:04,190
a lot so that's what this research is

357
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:09,679
based on so Android users starting with

358
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:14,120
I think lollipop a certain oh you I

359
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:17,419
prefix plus random bytes for doing Wi-Fi

360
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,008
probes and I wrote that out there so if

361
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:24,799
you find it an address like that you

362
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:27,799
just can ignore that and but it turns

363
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:50,360
out that this probing Mac so I have to

364
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:54,139
drink here so this probing Mac didn't

365
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,240
always was not always in every request

366
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:58,879
back then so that was funny observation

367
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,159
I think they got better with this I

368
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:04,279
don't know what caused the device to use

369
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:08,330
the original address for probing and

370
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:12,080
sometimes this special ID but well and

371
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:14,689
there's also randomized MAC addresses I

372
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,210
found that in the developer options of

373
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,100
my Android PI device so I don't know if

374
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,409
this is standard I'm using a 1 plus

375
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,619
device not sure if this is something

376
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:26,360
they put in there but there's also apps

377
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:28,519
out there that would require you to have

378
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,799
root on Android that would randomize

379
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:35,450
your MAC address when connecting on a

380
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:38,960
Wi-Fi networking in queue its default

381
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:46,240
you say good to know so for a lot of

382
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,240
people not so much for me well and

383
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:51,259
sometimes in Android devices there is a

384
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,450
deactivation of network interfaces once

385
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:55,190
they are not used so this is referring

386
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,980
to the doze feature that saves a lot of

387
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,200
energy on Android devices so this is

388
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,820
also a kind of meeting

389
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,070
against this issue but it's right there

390
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,928
and Wi-Fi access points with kinda

391
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,750
isolation would also not work for

392
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:13,179
getting addresses of them let's say

393
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,070
Google gasping network because find the

394
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:21,130
isolations active there I just tried

395
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:23,620
that before so knowing all this I came

396
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:26,130
up with the Beast the Beast

397
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:30,340
is is like just a hop with an attached

398
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:34,870
USB Armory which runs Kali Linux and has

399
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:38,439
I have to mention this a very high power

400
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,000
you can start in a car with that once

401
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,399
your battery is empty because you have

402
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,620
heaps once you switch on that hub you

403
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:47,289
will get a lot of current flow and most

404
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:50,439
battery packs won't be able to to

405
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:53,019
provide this kind of energy so that was

406
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,080
the first approach of doing all kinds of

407
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:58,630
scenarios so what did I do with that

408
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,760
there was like the hybrid method a I

409
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:06,490
call its just scanned for L a piece and

410
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,340
smartly correlate Wi-Fi probes with

411
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,169
these L a piece so how did I get these L

412
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,158
a piece these blue to specific lower

413
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:17,080
address parts I just used an uber tooth

414
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,230
having it on from wiskus mode which then

415
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,590
would monitor a few of the 79 channels

416
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:27,639
and grab off these lower address parts

417
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:29,949
and then correlate it timely with the

418
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:33,850
devices that send out Mac requests all

419
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:36,100
the time and just add these parts

420
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:40,000
together and try out whether there is

421
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:41,799
the device there or not the downside of

422
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,639
this approach is you need specialized

423
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:49,120
hardware obviously and both of the

424
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:51,760
devices interfaces must be communicating

425
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,279
for you to to see the MAC address of the

426
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,490
Wi-Fi interface and to see the lower

427
00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:01,179
address part of the Bluetooth interface

428
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:04,269
and the downside of this method is also

429
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:07,600
you have to you only able to defer to

430
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:10,149
find devices that have dual like two

431
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,159
kinds of interfaces like usually these

432
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:13,590
are smart phone

433
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,570
tablets laptops parables not so much

434
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:23,070
Brutus the only devices or like beacons

435
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:26,550
that only use Bluetooth Low Energy but

436
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:28,560
it's quite efficient so hyper a

437
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:32,430
Bluetooth device detection method P is

438
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:35,639
now a very easy approach so this is

439
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:38,250
based on that list of known offsets that

440
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,740
I was presenting earlier you just scan

441
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:46,040
for Wi-Fi max and do the math kind of

442
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:49,410
and then you do an educated guess on the

443
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:54,180
PD address and try to connect to it and

444
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:56,130
to ping it and see if it's there also is

445
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,410
the same downside only works for devices

446
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,700
which has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth interfaces

447
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:05,130
and also but there's a few upsides to

448
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,320
that you don't need special hardware so

449
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,630
the barrier the is very low to start

450
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,200
searching for Bluetooth devices with

451
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:15,900
this method and there's another upside

452
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,020
this may be net for that more on that

453
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,390
later

454
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:24,660
but you will now say well it's that the

455
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:30,480
title says advanced Bluetooth device

456
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:33,930
discovery and of course I took this into

457
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,710
account and I've always been curious in

458
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:39,780
that way so tens of flow is making that

459
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:44,990
advance as many other things as well so

460
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:48,180
it's machine learning and the plan is to

461
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:50,070
have two different models for that like

462
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:52,350
one classification model that would

463
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,500
based on the address tell me well

464
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:58,969
there's an offset of 1 or minus 1 or

465
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:02,160
2500 and the other part is for these

466
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:05,340
randomly addresses a randomly generated

467
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,250
addresses that maybe follow some rule

468
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:11,760
which is more complicated and that's why

469
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:15,240
I would like to do a regression model on

470
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,210
these addresses as well so my sample

471
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,700
size is way too little I they have 220

472
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,690
different devices which was a lot of

473
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,340
work

474
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:32,019
but I need more data for that for doing

475
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:34,720
modeling with tensorflow and there's

476
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:38,679
this proof-of-concept app which I call

477
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,889
peekaboo and the logo is a cat and that

478
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:44,289
that can't be a coincidence so go to the

479
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:46,899
Play Store and save the cat there's many

480
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:51,119
orphan cat copies out there they give

481
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:54,070
them a home on your phone please so it's

482
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:58,199
not yet available in the App Store on

483
00:24:54,070 --> 00:25:07,389
the market and in the Google Play Store

484
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:10,359
and we see shortly what it does that's a

485
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:16,090
demo it's it's just straightforward I'm

486
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:19,090
starting the app and now the app scans

487
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:21,009
for Wi-Fi addresses in the same hotspot

488
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:23,228
so this could be a public hotspot or

489
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:27,070
this could be your rogue access point

490
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:28,830
that you brought with you and now this

491
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,840
takes a little longer it tries to

492
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,599
connect the on the Bluetooth level it

493
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,908
does a thing of kind of two guesses per

494
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:40,359
device it's like just minus one and plus

495
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:44,229
one for now because I didn't incorporate

496
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:49,239
a tensorflow model yet so in to keep

497
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:55,840
things interesting only the last entry

498
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:59,200
on this list is is a match and by the

499
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,859
way it's not easy to do Bluetooth scans

500
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,009
with the android api it's not it's not

501
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:08,678
meant to be done there I think this has

502
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:11,499
to do with privacy concerns it's off

503
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:14,399
it's not even possible to to clean the

504
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:17,590
this own addresses from the device

505
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,449
before Android 6 it was possible to get

506
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,309
the MAC address from your device now you

507
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:25,210
would have to get the link local address

508
00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:28,418
of your Wi-Fi interface IP version 6 in

509
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:31,089
order to get your own MAC address and

510
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:33,220
maybe giving things away here because

511
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:36,279
this is a privacy concern with this

512
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:41,019
information apps can identify for

513
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:43,899
very closely and to the other hand the

514
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:47,590
BD address cannot be questioned anymore

515
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:53,469
from the AI API so what you see here you

516
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:55,899
didn't hear it but it said meow and and

517
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,990
this is the way how you would teach the

518
00:26:55,899 --> 00:27:01,870
system about a new address that is not

519
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,460
able to be discovered yet so I enter

520
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,350
here the the MAC address of the

521
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,539
Bluetooth device address of my tablet

522
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,309
and it's scanning this single device

523
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:12,730
again and you see the offset here

524
00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:15,789
something around thousand hundred ninety

525
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:18,429
six thousand this is a quick walkthrough

526
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:20,860
of the app so there's not not a lot of

527
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:24,610
things to see I hope you you saw the

528
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:27,189
time up there that was Sunday at 4:13

529
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:36,668
a.m. so I did work a lot for this app

530
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:38,769
and all ahead of time sure hmm so but in

531
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:42,309
order to get all this data I collect

532
00:27:38,769 --> 00:27:46,049
from this app so if you scan devices

533
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:49,418
I will send information back upon upon

534
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:51,399
positives that were identified and also

535
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:56,260
information about the devices that you

536
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:58,600
provided an address and this person this

537
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:02,019
data is not personal at all so it's

538
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:04,480
using randomized MAC addresses there's

539
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:07,000
usually an offset added to both

540
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,070
addresses so that the offset in between

541
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,970
those two addresses stays the same for

542
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:15,250
the learning the Bluetooth device name

543
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:19,679
which often holds the model name is

544
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:25,110
transmitted and the offered service IDs

545
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:27,250
and the offered service IDs are

546
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:29,379
collected for later use these are

547
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:33,789
usually uu IDs referring to things like

548
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:39,519
obex push like kind of offered services

549
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:42,750
why a Bluetooth classic and maybe we are

550
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:45,730
bringing back the traffic blueprinting

551
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:49,600
project which was all about identifying

552
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:56,679
models by their Bluetooth properties

553
00:28:49,600 --> 00:29:00,070
and yeah that this is also not personal

554
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,429
its you have to argue on a gdpr level

555
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,710
here

556
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:04,570
because I'm also collecting the Android

557
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:07,000
advertisement ID which is kind of unique

558
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,070
to your device that can be changed over

559
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,429
the course of time so this is not

560
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:14,860
personal but it would help me later on

561
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:18,070
to identify double entries with very

562
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:24,000
similar devices that I can then take out

563
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:26,500
of the sample and this is what a very

564
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,809
minimal version of a rogue access point

565
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:32,890
could look like so this is an el cheapo

566
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:34,658
I think he's dealing whatever access

567
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:38,470
point that I found one day intense a

568
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:40,809
Chinese interface only and you can set

569
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:45,190
it on a name and just power it on with a

570
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:47,770
little power bank and bring it along hmm

571
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:49,690
so I don't want to give you ideas but

572
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:52,110
maybe this is a new reason to lurk

573
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:54,610
around like public hotspot places and

574
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,549
see there we also have our first

575
00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:05,918
endorsement for the product it's it's

576
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:09,340
from hip people to hit people so that's

577
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,380
been it so I want to thank my wife Ewa

578
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:15,010
for bearing with me during especially

579
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:17,799
during the last two weekends I want to

580
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:20,110
thank green bond networks who's helping

581
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:22,900
me to work on the good side of things

582
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,299
and of course thanks to besides Munich

583
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:29,110
and all of you for making this possible

584
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:31,360
here so is there questions or maybe

585
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:43,020
that's your job Martin to ask for

586
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:50,469
questions are there any questions I look

587
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:53,500
right over there I think

588
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,090
to talk could you shortly elaborate what

589
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,309
you can do if you have the MAC address

590
00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:01,299
at Luton MAC address maybe I missed it

591
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:01,990
I'm glad you're asking so I prepared for

592
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:04,090
this question

593
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:07,030
so the question would be why we collect

594
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:09,939
or why would somebody collect Bluetooth

595
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:13,510
addresses I myself do not present an

596
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:18,280
attack here today but I have a question

597
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:20,200
FAQ so why is that you are familiar with

598
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,200
the underwear gnomes I think the

599
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:27,250
business model is very similar here so

600
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,250
phase one is collect VD address phase

601
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:32,280
two and phase three is profit right does

602
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:36,720
that answer your question

603
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:39,039
good I'm happy so any other questions

604
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,710
there must be questions this is a really

605
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:45,100
interesting talk I would have a question

606
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:47,620
because you mentioned that the Wi-Fi

607
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:50,350
system and the Bluetooth and shares

608
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,719
shares the same sock is this all like

609
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,309
like one big SDR device basically in

610
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,460
that sock or how do I have you ever

611
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:59,799
looked at that I'm not really but but

612
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,450
there is like no manufacturers that kind

613
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:03,039
of bundled all these functionalities I

614
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,470
don't know what the core on these

615
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,809
devices is looking like but I could

616
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:11,760
imagine that there is like crosstalk

617
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:11,760
possible like on a very low level

618
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,950
there's a question over there Michael

619
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,599
[Music]

620
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:32,289
these microphones are in bluetooth so

621
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:34,630
now it works so since you're prepared

622
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:36,340
for the first question my second

623
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,490
question is of what other questions have

624
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:41,879
you prepared very good question I'm glad

625
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,880
you're asking

626
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,659
so the other question I prepared for is

627
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:53,789
why did you use a cat there so cats are

628
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:55,799
sneaky and so are you when using

629
00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:58,379
peekaboo and of course there's a very

630
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:01,559
famous example of a cat choosing little

631
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,390
blue things and that is Azrael from The

632
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,830
Smurfs

633
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:08,039
so that's that's the other question and

634
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:14,029
then to be honest to have also here like

635
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:14,029
a list of oh - one - quick well

636
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:20,490
something bad happens who's been hacking

637
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:22,590
him yeah alright so that was just the

638
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:26,279
Bill of Materials for the beasts which

639
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:29,309
is like around 300 euros like given or

640
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:32,490
like there was two Bluetooth uber tooth

641
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:35,340
dongles a lot of standard dongles and

642
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,899
that's been it for for the Beast so that

643
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:40,949
was the third question I was appreciate

644
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:45,600
thanks for the question trying to do any

645
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:48,779
other questions really no more questions

646
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,529
are you all basically frying or this

647
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,529
question right over here

648
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,428
hi when you have these addresses can you

649
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:57,600
ping them directly so if you know the

650
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:58,980
address normally you have to discover

651
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,049
them if you have them do you have

652
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,960
software to just write them and attack

653
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:06,149
them or something hmm

654
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,580
yeah you can of course if you have the

655
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:11,819
address of the standard way under Linux

656
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:14,848
would have been to to do an l2 ping that

657
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:17,520
required the device to be in payable

658
00:34:14,849 --> 00:34:19,440
mode or to respond to page requests and

659
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,810
there's devices out there for example my

660
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,000
new car doesn't respond respond to page

661
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,879
requests anymore so that's a hardening

662
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,820
measure that no vendor would consider I

663
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,418
guess because it's like - I have to

664
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,200
click here

665
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:36,569
I don't always click always clear always

666
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:43,189
click I just open up the presentation

667
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:43,190
once more okay

668
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:49,199
so there's nothing more to see except my

669
00:34:47,130 --> 00:35:01,130
contact details so in case you have

670
00:34:49,199 --> 00:35:04,020
questions afterwards so here we go so

671
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:06,690
right so you would have to ping it this

672
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:11,040
is not possible under under Android you

673
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:13,140
have a very limited possibility to talk

674
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,009
to external devices which is for a

675
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:19,200
reason I guess but the good thing is the

676
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:21,780
app doesn't require root access with

677
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,060
root you would maybe be able to install

678
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,940
some kind of binaries on there in order

679
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:31,970
to facilitate a ping as we know it from

680
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:37,830
Linux so if there are no further

681
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:39,870
questions I would like you to help me by

682
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:43,009
thanking Martin for this wonderful talk

683
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,009
about Bluetooth discovery
