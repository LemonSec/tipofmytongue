customers or to all the people we were

42
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:41,200
talking to and we saw a lot of others

43
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:44,320
for a professional indemnity a liability

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,769
or for directors and officers insurances

45
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:52,650
and zone but you didn't see any offers

46
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:57,520
for fabulous mistress and we asked why

47
00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:00,730
and if you ask why what you gonna do you

48
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,170
ask people to give you two answers and

49
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:07,859
that's actually damage honest please

50
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:15,459

51
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:21,430
seen on a sea off on or seen on a sea

52
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:23,560
level and sea level executed so and we

53
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:28,209
started and asked them so we reached out

54
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:33,130
to 300 of them and they answered and we

55
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:39,430
asked them so we didn't stop started and

56
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:43,600
we asked them what do you think is the

57
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:48,580
probability to be a victim of a cyber

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:53,500
attack and that's said ok yeah something

59
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:55,090
like that and we are Ken what do you

60
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,400
think about the next five years

61
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:02,320
I said yeah we'll think this massively

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,660
really cool for us because we sell the

63
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:14,859
suburbs considerable but it okay why you

64
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:17,769
think you actually you children have the

65
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:20,830
right time risk are to be evicted of

66
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,989
cyberhood of the company the victim of

67
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,650
fabulous

68
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:29,370
and why this massively included just one

69
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,690
question good things company you have a

70
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,370
working for you you found out something

71
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:42,060
like this has no risk of being a victim

72
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:45,349
of a cyber attack that who was already

73
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,349
victim of acid attack

74
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:54,030
no one is one not even damn indirectly

75
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:57,419

79
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:22,560
they see do ask perhaps surely and they

80
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,930
say they see also do it

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,210
well massively increasing within the

82
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:33,990
next year but we ask them what do you do

83
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:38,280
to prevent your or which technique do

84
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:44,460
you use so it does maybe I should do is

85

86
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,698
minimize she's fabulous and of course is

87
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:53,698
that antivirus software we use firewalls

88
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,650
and so on who sinks antivirus software

89
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,639
and firewalls are enough to prevent

90
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:05,758
cyber risks they were sworn into him

91
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:13,199

is this topic for your business

117
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:20,920
journaling be yeah it's a medium risk

118
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,920
who thinks obelisk is a media most

119
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:31,610
you think this in this instructive on

120
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,640
century you notice you know this quote

121
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,570
in the center in the 21st century data

122
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,539
is like all wars in the 18th century

123
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:44,720
striving your business method okay yeah

124
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:49,990
it will be a medium with in the next

125
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:59,060
five years as well okay confused as well

126
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:59,750
so we moved on and asked them what do

127
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,040
you think

128
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:05,900
and what's the challenges investments in

129
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,439
technology in the investments in

130
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:16,069
employees investment in trainings for

131
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:23,050
your company to minimize the risk of

132
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:30,800
cyber cyber attacks as that oh yeah we

133
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:35,209
see high investment see anybody any room

134
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:47,510
with another opinion high investment

135
00:09:35,210 --> 00:10:15,740
service is a fact perfect

136
00:09:47,510 --> 00:10:18,050
I was looking for their yeah yeah what

137
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:25,280
do you think about do we need a high

138
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:34,609
investment cyber security or any other

139
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:37,400
way do you think exactly exactly

140
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,220
it's it's not a project it's a

141
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:44,060
continuous involvement as you already

142
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,160
know in the room it's not just starting

143
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:54,380
one well Jack here and so on the next

144
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:56,060
one do you also think how what do you

145
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:02,210
what do you think about the investments

146
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:08,630
here cyber with anyone in lumen said oh

147
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:11,630
yeah we should we should decrease secure

148
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:30,710
level of investments in cyber risk

149
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:37,900
prevention anyone Mitchell like it's

150
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:37,900
like this one this one this one okay

151
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:54,470
okay he's that he was he said companies

152
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,970
will invest more in cyber insurance in

153
00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:00,220
the future that's what we see in this

154
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:04,400
study as well here 41 percent but

155
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:07,990
investing in cyber secure knows it's not

156
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,990
prevention it

157
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:16,810
yeah but if you see here for mine from

158
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:21,490
my perspective it's ten percent of

159
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:27,300
companies we asked and they have a sub

160
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:30,870
insurance they understood that a

161
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,699
cyberattack is not about order there are

162
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:37,570
things we have to do talk to a cyber

163
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:41,460
attack was successful is not just using

164
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:45,940
the last backup and clean all your

165
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:52,140
computers and start over then is third a

166
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:54,730
terrorism let's say crisis communication

167
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,600
monitoring of personal data monitoring

168
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:01,840
of credit card data and so on

169
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:04,810
so we if they invest in seven shows from

170
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:08,230
my perspective they invest in safety

171
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:11,939
after desire but hex happens and it's

172
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,940
about it's part of the risk management

173
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:18,550
but it's not not prevention here and of

174
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:25,449
course I really have if they invest more

175
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:32,650
in cyber insurance on a low level yeah

176
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:40,380
on a low level more questions regarding

177
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:40,380
this line so I'm going to declare okay

178
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,250
people living there getting microphone

179
00:13:50,910 --> 00:14:02,939
no move on you move on so just regarding

180
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:09,870
use cyber risk or cyber risk insurance

181
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:09,870
you see here in the next twelve month

182
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:20,709
only 14% of the company we asked have

183
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:25,569
even thought about

184
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:30,138
sunny a suburb risk-insurance

185
00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:31,878
and the other one it's 77% they haven't

186
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:35,809
even thought about doing it in the next

187
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:39,160
12 month so yes maybe they do it and we

188
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:42,769
have a massively increase in 2024

189
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,049
but since 2024 let's say 2022 or

190
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:49,249
something like this they haven't even

191
00:14:45,049 --> 00:15:15,439
thought about there is a risk management

192
00:14:49,249 --> 00:15:16,759
after cyberattacks and that's the point

193
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:20,029
where I wish Dennis would be here

194
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:25,579
because he is insurance expert but I try

195
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:28,699
to explain risk insurance it covers the

196
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:32,359
costs for your computer system and also

197
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:34,549
if you have any NDA's and will be

198
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,999
violated by your data breach ends on

199
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:42,669
crisis communication all the costs for

200
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:46,910
lawyers regulatory affairs and so on but

201
00:15:42,669 --> 00:16:01,730
the question was about the revenue loss

202
00:15:46,910 --> 00:16:03,980
based on the data right no the answer is

203
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:11,119
really easy no because that's that's why

204
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:20,389
you need prevention as well I really

205
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:24,110
love this okay as I said there were just

206
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:29,899
a slide and I want to start a discussion

207
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:33,990
here so maybe can share your experience

208
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:37,540
and new opinions based on

209
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:40,059
these numbers you sir

210
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,730
based on your daily work will be very

211
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:45,240
very helpful for us as well to

212
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,980
understand I would say I said 10 minutes

213
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:52,050
sorry I'm Elias I told you we do it in

214
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,050
20 min we do 20 minutes is casual but

215
00:16:52,410 --> 00:17:22,928
maybe we can start with the tenets of

216
00:16:54,939 --> 00:17:26,970
Kozma buzzes yes please yeah so younger

217
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:29,440
companies especially if they are working

218
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,510
with customization if they're working

219
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:38,429
with personalization and so on yeah okay

220
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:40,690
they often use cyber risk insurance

221
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:43,360
intervention as well or more

222
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:56,110
sophisticated more intelligent for

223
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:58,178
service prevention so so I guess based

224
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,010
on that I guess if data is more

225
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:03,010
structured is used on a daily base in

226
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:11,520
your company you more are you investing

227
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:14,649
more money in securing your data no

228
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,529
there's some question you know yeah so

229
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:27,668
but just can you throw to him after your

230
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:32,130
question that will be great Thanks can

231
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:32,130
you move the microphone Joseph

232
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,769
[Music]

233
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:52,120
yeah exactly

234
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:55,610
that's one of our findings as well

235
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:59,090
because often after

236
00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:04,129
cybertek oddly the otega expectations

237
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:07,669
after cyber taggers we use the last

238
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:10,910
beggar we clean our computer system we

239
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:14,030
go back to the status before this as

240
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:17,620
soon as possible at a cyber attack but

241
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:21,649
before of course and everything is fine

242
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:24,020
they didn't realize they need to do

243
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,420
cyber they need to do crisis

244
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,450
communication they do not realize you

245
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:34,700
need to you they need to pay for lawyers

246
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:37,040
because this regulatory affairs and so

247
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,790
on and all these other are the stuff

248
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,340
like NDA

249
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:42,620
like you have parties you have data of a

250
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,620
third party or something like this they

251
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,840
don't think about it so we talk to them

252
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,489
and we were very confused about the

253
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,110
answers to be honest because that's what

254
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,250
I said and some of them that yeah it's

255
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,820
another problem we're using the last

256
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,320
backup we don't need any of that

257
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,419
yeah right it's like it's like common

258
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:17,929
sense right what we do to prevent servos

259
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:37,370
yeah common sense please I'll go to your

260
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:40,100
microphone when you understand it or we

261
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:57,560
asked ok there's a second second part of

262
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:58,790
the question sorry ok start with

263
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,419
question number one because there's a

264
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,420
wanna concert

265
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:14,250
so we are both so we asked them about

266
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:16,650
prevention our service comes from

267
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,050
outside or also about social engineering

268
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,730
something like this so and that's why we

269
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:24,000
asked about a security awareness

270
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:26,910
training so we do both but we didn't

271
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,040
split the serve it based on inside out

272
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:36,960
or outside in attacks the second

273
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:41,360
question as I said then is histy

274
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:44,910
insurance mastermind so but I guess

275
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,820
there will be no prevention based on

276
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:50,490
cyber risk insurance maybe some kind of

277
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:54,629
discount but actually I'm not sure if

278
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:56,850
you want to have a answer on this

279
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:58,980
question you want to be sure it's

280
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,530
hundred percent correct please give me

281
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,810
your business card I will give them to

282
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,300
Dennis and he will answer all your or

283
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:09,919
we'll follow up on them so to be honest

284
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:24,960
I can't answer them okay that was a the

285
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:26,450
kuipers forum somewhere there yeah but

286
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,400
my last slide

287
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,750
hello okay yeah you know for the the

288
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,700
last slide you showed I think while you

289
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,190
explained it you work on kind of

290
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,110
contradicting what the slide set because

291
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,080
this one yes because I mean if I reach

292
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,879
for hang on 77 percent have an insurance

293
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,000
in place already right that's what the

294
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:49,280
slices or no no no no no no there's that

295
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,260
nine percent they already have one yes

296
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:56,820
then no with the planned war and so we

297
00:22:52,260 --> 00:23:00,060
sort about to do it in the next next

298
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:03,240
month forty percent and the other one no

299
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:05,669
we don't have insurance and we haven't

300
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:11,100
even thought about okay hopefully it's

301
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:13,260
right because hopefully with this one -

302
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,840
okay question - that then

303
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,640
would be what sort of sectors have you

304
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:35,909
interviewed to do that and how big were

305
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:40,550
the businesses just one one man so so so

306
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:44,970
we are SEC here 253 companies so

307
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:47,840
actually not companies CEOs or CEOs the

308
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:50,580
company so c-level executives and it was

309
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,159
as if his share was between it was

310
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:59,210
mostly smv companies the small medium

311
00:23:53,160 --> 00:24:02,820
business with more than one shareholder

312
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,690
so let's say it's not like a tax company

313
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,909
or something like this

314
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:11,750
it's a traditional German company

315
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:15,570
between 5 million and 500 million

316
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:19,260
revenue year thanks and how do you I

317
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:21,360
mean when you follow news reports about

318
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,450
cyber insurances and latest cybertek's

319
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,370
yeah you probably also observe the trend

320
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,380
that they are trying to call certain of

321
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:30,239
those an act of war which would

322
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,700
basically release them from their

323
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,890
payments so if you take all the latest

324
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,140
ransomware thing is like my petty and

325
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:41,340
stuff they are actively pushing for act

326
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:46,170
of war to not hey I believe they do that

327
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:48,750
yes the end of war okay yes so I don't

328
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:56,400
know but my question would more be I

329
00:24:48,750 --> 00:25:03,390
mean yeah what's your opinion to that so

330
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:13,580
sorry cyber attacks as act of war those

331
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:16,730
ones which one from my point of view a

332
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:19,770
company if it's a private company and

333
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:22,940
the private company to do prevention did

334
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:27,020
city also to make Chrisman

335
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,780
a-feng add as a business or illegal

336
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,520
business that it's business and it's not

337
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:37,460
an act of war but that's my personal

338
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,850
opinion here sorry can I quickly comment

339
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,820
on that

340
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,590
so I work for quite a large insurance

341
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,169
company that also offers service

342
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,270
security services and regarding the

343
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:50,840
comment that some of the insurers are

344
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:52,910
pulling this war or terrorism card it's

345
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,090
quite of a misconception in the industry

346
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:59,000
so when we talk about cases like not

347
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,280
petia and Merck and whatever it's the

348
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,230
property business interruption police's

349
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,790
that don't want to pay out the business

350
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:09,290
interruption caused by the cyber tech

351
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:12,080
but all standalone cyber policies that

352
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:14,450
these companies had fully paid the

353
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,020
limits so cyber insurance actually pays

354
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:21,290
also in these cases those are just the

355
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:23,150
disputes regarding the property policies

356
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,620
that these companies have so it's

357
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:27,020
business just the business that eruptive

358
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:32,770
was not just it was a business

359
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:32,770
interruption insurance okay good to know

360
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:42,020
