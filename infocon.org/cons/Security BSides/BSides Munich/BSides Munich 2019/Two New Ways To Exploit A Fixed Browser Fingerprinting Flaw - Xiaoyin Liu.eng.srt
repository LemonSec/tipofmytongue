[Music]

2
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:49,090
who has already discovered two bugs in

3
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:50,729
the fingerprinting of web browsers and

4
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,869
he will be discussing about the

5
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,209
vulnerabilities that he has found and

6
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:58,600
what are the fixes and what would the

7
00:01:55,209 --> 00:02:01,720
bypass that he found for those fixes as

8
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,658
well so overdue you show me okay thank

9
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,689
you so much okay so hi everyone good

10
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:10,630
morning my name is Sally and Leo and I

11
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:14,380
come from China today I'm happy to come

12
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:16,560
here to to pea-sized so that I can share

13
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:21,400
always see with some of my findings in

14
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:26,350
information security okay so first of

15
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,989
all this is a briefing to that on myself

16
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,480
I'm an independent accountant I

17
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:33,910
graduated from the University of North

18
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,298
Carolina at Chapel Hill inside

19
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:40,299
University in United States I study

20
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:45,340
mathematics as a communal science at the

21
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:48,850
college and I'm grateful night by metal

22
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:52,480
sound to Google browser for project and

23
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:54,900
many more for the one who is that I've

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,119
found in their products

25
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,709
errors of the interests include Windows

26
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,319
applications web browsers and I'm also

27
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:09,269
like to to the source code source code

28
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,268
auditing in C and C++

29
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,299
[Music]

30
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:20,080
okay so here's the proof all now all my

31
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,000
talk today first how I tell him what had

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,420
a fingerprinting issues in web browser

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,340
and then we'll focus on one specific

34
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,459
fingerprinting usual which is called

35
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,970
sniff the attack then I will talk about

36
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:37,270
two purposes that are found in the use

37
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,220
their patch and then takeaways by the

38
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:42,610
faculty I will share with you another

39
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:51,010
one of the 80 in Marisa of the age which

40
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:53,320
is Sevilla 2017 31 35 okay so first of

41
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,690
all like to talk about what are the pros

42
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,579
of fingerprinting usuals so the

43
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,220
philippine initials refers to the

44
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,650
flouncy in web browsers there are law

45
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,570
websites to track users were allowed

46
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:09,670
them to know some private information

47
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:12,070
about users like browsing history this a

48
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:15,059
wire single finger finding is privately

49
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:18,790
family issues but well unfortunately

50
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,370
many of the browser vendors they don't

51
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:24,190
think fingerprinting issues are security

52
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,560
usuals so they are not likely to fix

53
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,950
them you know quick manner

54
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,250
unlike unless you use tor browser which

55
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,140
is designed to protect your privacy so

56
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:38,230
if you like privacy I encourage you to

57
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,690
use photo browser a lot and some of the

58
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:43,960
examples of fingerprinting issues in the

59
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:47,950
past include I just had super cookie

60
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:51,520
usual on the census of visited usual but

61
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,920
today I was just talking about the

62
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:59,260
sniffly attack the sniffing ooh attack

63
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:02,050
was discovered by en route in 2015 this

64
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,469
article uses artists ES and the swollen

65
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:08,260
with erect and a Content security policy

66
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:12,240
to attract users browsing history this

67
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:18,099
one ability is assigned three year 2017

68
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:20,080
2016 16 30 okay so before it's how about

69
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,050
sniffly that's clearly reveal what has

70
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,599
done costea's honest

71
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:29,490
current security policy so I trust yes

72
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:32,030
is HTTP strict Transport Security it has

73
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,370
a browser security feature that enables

74
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:38,789
that allows websites to enforce HD dvrs

75
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,159
for all connections to their server so

76
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:43,229
there will be no plant head HTTP

77
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:47,550
connection to the to the domains that

78
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:49,199
have enabled a chance to exit and this

79
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,599
policy is delivered the you know

80
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,940
actually even Hydra strict transfer of

81
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:56,960
security you can see on the on the same

82
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,909
line this is a I trust has Hydra

83
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:05,219
stegasaurus ensue problem superior

84
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:07,530
Transport Security Medicaid and next is

85
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,580
a Content security policy an account

86
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:14,068
security policy is another security

87
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,780
feature in web browser even was designed

88
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:21,599
to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks

89
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,940
and the second line is also uh content

90
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,880
security policy Hydra it's also actually

91
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:30,330
be Hydra sent by the universal value'

92
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,860
server to pull clients kind of security

93
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:37,590
policy so this means whenever even if

94
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,259
there's a process scripting at monopoly

95
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:42,659
on the webpage it's harder for the

96
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,090
attackers to exploit it because you can

97
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:49,529
only connect to the same domain which is

98
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:51,929
the cell and then also the wwe.com so

99
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:54,560
you can now to load scripts from other

100
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,900
domains including the attackers to learn

101
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,210
and more recently CSP is also used to

102
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,419
deliver some other security features

103
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,969
like operating in secure request but

104
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:10,620
that's not quite related to the sniffly

105
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:14,279
attack okay so next let's talk about how

106
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:17,639
sniffly works so simply is actually

107
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:20,610
quite simple because it's just an image

108
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,880
tag this starts from an email type so

109
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,779
life size so you can see that the URL

110
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,020
here

111
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:30,240
you sang become it is you cannot check

112
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,719
on orbit for a URL and see if the users

113
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,840
within that but if you know the user

114
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:39,020
mode outcome is either actual TI

115
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,289
Stormin or is already raised from HTTP

116
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:46,760
to actually the ass then you can use

117
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:49,910
that your your image head and if the

118
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:53,780
user has never visited this URL this is

119
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:56,720
what happens so the first room the when

120
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,989
the browser tries to pinch this URL the

121
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,810
first request is HTTP example.com and

122
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:05,690
since you this request is sent to the

123
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:09,100
server and then the server replies also

124
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,719
and really write to the browser which is

125
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,330
location actually the ass and then the

126
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,460
browser will select either ass request

127
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:20,000
to the server and you get back the web

128
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:24,080
page but if you have with it hit this

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
URL this is what will happen what

130
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:31,039
happens is that the really right is how

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,130
is also cashed in the browser

132
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,650
so this first request is a in browser

133
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,229
internal redirect and then a second

134
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:43,968
request goes to the server and then you

135
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:47,540
get back the direct wash now I see on

136
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:50,510
our page it's usually cache because as I

137
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,880
see as is as I just said is saved in the

138
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:57,170
browser as you already run is usually

139
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:01,490
comfortable so if we want to know if the

140
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:04,699
user has visited this this URL what you

141
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:07,180
can do is that if you long time how long

142
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:10,730
it takes for the really read will happen

143
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:15,079
you can know if it's in browser redirect

144
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,480
or as a network redirect okay but in

145
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,080
order to do that is necessary to block

146
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,970
the HTTP request to the server because

147
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,860
usually when you have a really route the

148
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,410
browser will automatically follow the

149
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:31,220
redirect and then you can only turn the

150
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:34,160
entire the entire time for the proposal

151
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,650
requests but here we only need to type

152
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,740
the first request which is the really

153
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:42,800
read part so we we have to find a way to

154
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:47,570
block this secondary pass which is the

155
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,859
key for the sniffly attack so how does

156
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:52,300
it work we

157
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:56,420
content security policy to prop the hdvs

158
00:09:52,300 --> 00:10:01,670
so you can see here's a header image SRC

159
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:07,040
HDTV : w zombocom this means you can

160
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:10,790
only load from HTTP use a modicum not

161
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,699
actually the ice few example calm so in

162
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:18,709
such all it is the type C has a rip has

163
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:21,710
a way we brought and the yokai Cena

164
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:24,320
shows that you the error you want which

165
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,620
is fatal here we call how the CSV policy

166
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,500
there will your everyone file here so

167
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:33,410
you the error you want is fired within

168
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,530
10 milliseconds then we know is you can

169
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,870
already right otherwise it's a network

170
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:43,780
with your ugly which means that the URL

171
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:47,570
has never been visited okay and then

172
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:51,470
here's a cool snippet of the patch you

173
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:54,620
can see that the change the the scheme

174
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:58,100
merged so you the scheme of the CSV is

175
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:02,180
HTTP then in now merge both HTTP and

176
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,730
HTTPS similarly for the web sock for the

177
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:12,349
web socket rollover is also double as

178
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:16,520
normal sports stars and double as X so

179
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:20,360
now the same the same necessity hider

180
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,199
now my suppose HTTP the example.com and

181
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,620
hdvs

182
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,680
example calm this means we can no longer

183
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,950
exploit the sniffly attack because now

184
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:36,319
you cannot use this Hydra to block the

185
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:39,890
HTTP request okay so next how I buy

186
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,770
parts of it I realized that the code

187
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:45,590
only considers the protocol the protocol

188
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:48,290
part not a port prod so let's consider

189
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:52,220
this as you current security policy

190
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:55,400
emergency so basically either the port

191
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,500
number 80 to this URL and now the

192
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:02,339
question is does this one match

193
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:06,849
I still guys : Devils are you so calm

194
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:08,949
it turns out this CSV Maps as GDP was

195
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:12,099
for the anything and I've seen eyes

196
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:15,639
Westport 80 but it does not matter I've

197
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:20,279
seen eyes with port 443 which is the

198
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:23,829
port for ITV is this means we can use

199
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:28,389
since can secure the policy to block our

200
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:31,649
CVS request once other must we can do

201
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:35,259
that we can exploit the sniffly again

202
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:39,039
and this is just a very small channel

203
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:42,759
and then it just works and I found that

204
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:47,249
both Google Chrome and Firefox I wonder

205
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:51,879
about Tuesday's back and I reported to

206
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:55,449
both of the track both of the tickets up

207
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:58,029
here and they also assigned to CVS for

208
00:12:55,449 --> 00:13:04,089
each router and then the pool gave me

209
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:07,449
$1,000 for the bounty and here's the

210
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:10,479
patch for from mile high you can see

211
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:16,508
here the if the port is 80 is no match

212
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:18,939
for business way okay and not only the a

213
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:21,339
change in the code the other change the

214
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:24,248
recipe specification who mentioned the

215
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:30,159
figs you can see that they have check

216
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:32,379
that to remind people that had okay so

217
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,779
did not face to the first bad pass and

218
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:36,789
now I was I was wondering you know there

219
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:41,109
is a cell in that house and it turns out

220
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:43,629
yes so far we will use the content

221
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:46,599
security policy to block the HTTP

222
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:47,859
requests but are there any other ways to

223
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:50,769
achieve the same effect

224
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:53,459
actually yes so we can just I just fun

225
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:56,949
that we can use feature here to do that

226
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:59,348
so what is fever yeah the future AP is a

227
00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:02,289
is a quite a new JavaScript if you are

228
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:04,569
allowing you to retrieve a URL and the

229
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:06,968
very cool thing about the future India

230
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:09,998
is that it allows you to customize the

231
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:12,630
to requires and one other feature is the

232
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:15,420
really remove the really rack the mode

233
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,730
three warriors follow arrow or manual

234
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,550
the follower is the normal one which you

235
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,700
catch the final response after following

236
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:26,520
all the redirects but here what we need

237
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,800
is the man you already read the manual

238
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,410
ready read allows you to handle the

239
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,540
ready round manually which basically

240
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:36,449
means you and cat I'll call and you can

241
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,969
kind of combat whenever there is already

242
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,910
rush happens which is exactly what we

243
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:44,730
need for the sniff real-time Beyonce

244
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:47,069
sigh we don't even need frog - DBS we

245
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,760
can just get caught when the when the

246
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,820
really rotten is received

247
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,950
Fran this is a very similar see I

248
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:59,040
started a really rad more to menu and

249
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:01,770
then I can just go to the response if

250
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,410
the response status is a sewer one

251
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:07,350
little mini Caesar

252
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:10,589
it's a really rapid response and that I

253
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:13,200
can just stop the timer here you have

254
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:18,990
the interval is less than 10 millisecond

255
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:22,620
is waited and otherwise it is not that I

256
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:24,900
recorded this in philosophy and it

257
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,790
interface it for a minute while this for

258
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:30,660
two years

259
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:33,500
finally I I recently phone is fixed

260
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,699
silently you got 18 updated the Chicot

261
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,670
watch why that is this

262
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:41,040
no no CRS cannot use together with

263
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:44,040
manually rate which means I can no

264
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,290
longer handle the the ready route if

265
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,170
it's across our regional pass which is

266
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:52,670
basically what we try to be split in a

267
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:57,209
sniffling tab okay

268
00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:01,160
and so this is a little ways from my

269
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:03,690
main experience in in the to pack houses

270
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,770
basically I just want to encourage you

271
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:09,660
to reading reports on the red house and

272
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:12,630
if we understand them and you implement

273
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:18,630
your own PLC maybe even just find some

274
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:21,089
easy path from that okay now I would

275
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:23,370
talk about another one ability to show

276
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:25,040
that it's really useful to read other

277
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:30,470
people's report

278
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,449
and this is City Year 2070 201 35 this

279
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:35,750
one I caught the inspiration from this

280
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:38,180
paper abusing in tonight's for a quasi

281
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:42,110
screwing infielder he also written

282
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:44,388
written by this view and first of all

283
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,120
the paper tells me how the process

284
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:50,990
scrutiny field works

285
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:53,509
so basically it the process scrutiny

286
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:57,350
filters used to mitigate reflected

287
00:16:53,509 --> 00:17:00,079
crosses process scripting attack its

288
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:03,860
checks you funny URL parameter seems to

289
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:07,639
be a cross I screwed in payload so for

290
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:11,299
example for you love this URL the ID the

291
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:14,150
ID parameter is a script that had so you

292
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:16,699
know I explore things this can be

293
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:20,000
potentially a cross-site scripting hello

294
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:23,870
I thought you've check see if the index

295
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,910
here out there is a same string if

296
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:29,809
they're also same screen they'll change

297
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:32,950
the script the script attire so I see

298
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:40,010
Hodge IPT basically this chrome is just

299
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:42,140
disabled but what if is not a reflecting

300
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,200
that course excluding advisor is an

301
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:48,260
actual jazz called Linda Linda HTML

302
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,010
source so for example you for this page

303
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:54,379
use AMA communist stuff USB what if this

304
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:57,290
page tries to know their jQuery thought

305
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:00,700
yes that's how I gave you this URL I'll

306
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:03,649
kinda screw up the tag through the URL

307
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,290
and now what happens is that the browser

308
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:10,250
thinks this is of course excluding

309
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:14,210
attack because this this substituent is

310
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,260
also contained in the HTML file so the

311
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,860
Filner gens

312
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:24,470
the script - I see hash a video wise out

313
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:27,469
then so the trigger just won't blow the

314
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,690
notice that had a pretty early part this

315
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,960
thing is pretty harmless because they

316
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:35,210
just think it's just I see if trickery

317
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,850
radhaji has doesn't exist because it's

318
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,590
kind of one another other some other

319
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,379
reasons

320
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,959
like the network usually water at

321
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,440
essaouira usual hill us return this form

322
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,430
for like that when I found is that

323
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,890
really harness it has unknown because I

324
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:58,940
can abuse the process screening further

325
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:00,950
to this neighbors ESP the search via as

326
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,560
I just said since we community where the

327
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,050
yeshiva Hydra but it can also be a TD or

328
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,980
a young man that had this is a merit how

329
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:12,290
to cite on the content security policy

330
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,660
know what I what I'm doing here is that

331
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:18,920
iodine disease huh

332
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:21,650
this whole tied to a URL as I just said

333
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,920
for the jQuery example they also sing

334
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,840
this melody is a quarter screwed not

335
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:31,010
high because it isn't reflected in the

336
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:33,939
HTML and what what they are doing is

337
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:37,190
that the change of the mailer tied to a

338
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:40,850
magical bait which means this tag is

339
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:43,370
disabled so I created a very symbol

340
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:47,530
another way of similar you will see I

341
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:52,489
just had a magnet head in the pattern

342
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:54,590
and then here's a script alert if them

343
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,010
you this kind of security policies in

344
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,070
false

345
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:01,730
there should be no alert because because

346
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:05,629
all that this is a unite script and it

347
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:08,090
only allows self script but if the

348
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:12,050
current security policy is disabled by

349
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:14,770
the filter this alert will show up and

350
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:18,220
it turns out if I waited this URL now

351
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:21,410
this is what happens this is a pop-up

352
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:25,730
shown by the mouth of the edge which

353
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:29,720
means we got a new one ability to the

354
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:33,820
exciting please aim and I reported it to

355
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:37,330
max out on this summer 2016 is face the

356
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:42,350
March 2017 and pontius

357
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:44,179
1500 effort a recently removed remove

358
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,340
the process screen filter entirely from

359
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,580
nerves all age

360
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,820
yeah 2018 because no other types of

361
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,730
allies there are many others like to

362
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:58,480
abuse the Heartless green filter and it

363
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:02,950
also incurs performance provenance cost

364
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:07,080
so they just decided to remove that okay

365
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:31,299
and the hard references from I talk and

366
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:33,220
okay so you just one question how much

367
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:39,100
time does it take you to find out these

368
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:42,610
how much work do you uh last time I uh I

369
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:45,490
read the report the first thing I can

370
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,619
say is support either a portal to a URL

371
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,820
and is just the worst actually it's very

372
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:53,408
surprising to me

373
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:57,039
so like I'm our basically that as far as

374
00:21:53,409 --> 00:22:00,970
in another lesson love to find a second

375
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:03,789
bylaws and similarly for the process

376
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:23,379
screen filled up it's also about one or

377
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:25,389
two hours I think yeah if you only

378
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:28,449
research for one or two hours but you

379
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:33,029
probably what are you doing on your

380
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,029
daily basis there alright anyways it

381
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:41,280
[Music]

382
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:45,530
I realize why I really pose a the poster

383
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:50,639
bada like the Windows internals and then

384
00:22:45,530 --> 00:23:15,149
we really report an alpha program a lot

385
00:22:50,640 --> 00:23:21,679
and I contributed to how many birds did

386
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:21,679
find her mom not many like towards me

387
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:27,809
there are a lot of private pilot

388
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:31,230
programs that you like me to go find

389
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:36,210
like that so like you spend your time

390
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:39,750
like really a lot yeah really report on

391
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:44,460
that's where I spokes okay yeah not just

392
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:46,080
a report much so these bugs were from

393
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,620
2016

394
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:55,860

395
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:59,040

396
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:03,090
the web browser recently on that I also

397
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:04,950
