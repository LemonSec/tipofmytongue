1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,840
my name is Mohammed Abbas today we will

2
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:10,940
talk about small thoughts multi-factor

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,390
authentication using smart cards and

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:17,000
Android on web first we'll discuss

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,220
authentication and then we'll present

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,830
our proposed solution this talk was a

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,939
part of my master's research in National

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,939
University of Science and Technology

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,590
authentication is an important security

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:33,199
control to protect the system regarding

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:36,050
CIA properties to protect the system

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:37,818
form an unauthorized entity the

13
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:43,068
authentication process is basic and

14
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:45,620
first line of defense millions of users

15
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:50,920
have been affected on that from all over

16
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,919
the world because of unauthorized access

17
00:00:51,190 --> 00:01:00,078
unfortunately in this puzzle so as we

18
00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:01,940
saw user authentication is important and

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,430
require to achieve our security walls

20
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:08,570
and I've seen mobile transactions are

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,550
expected to exceed 100 billion dollars

22
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,889
by 2020

23
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:16,370
we can use NFC for authentication

24
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:18,320
purpose with smart card as smart cards

25
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,780
can provide strong security to

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,580
authenticate an entity to achieve our

27
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:29,600
security goals objective of this

28
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:32,150
research is an alternative approach for

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,940
secure the user authentication which

30
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:39,400
provides mutual entity verification

31
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,399
using smart phone and smart card for

32
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:46,640
more than 15% of Internet users have

33
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:50,350
reported experiencing the takeover of an

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,240
email or social networking account

35
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:55,729
making progress to make a password free

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,158
world we will review the shortcomings

37
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:01,840
and strengths of popular authentication

38
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:06,860
factors and select the best approach for

39
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,628
small table knowledge-based based

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,299
authentication has some problems like

41
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:13,969
remembering according to a psychology

42
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:16,340
review an average person tends to

43
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:19,630
remember only 7

44
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,400
random characters of debt approximately

45
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:28,220
one two three four five six was still

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,620
the top password in 2080 according to a

47
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,750
Google research in the case of third

48
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:38,090
party data bridges 12% of the exposed

49
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,459

50
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:44,390
address serving as a username and

51
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:49,160
password of those passwords 7% were

52
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:53,500

53
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,880
50% increase in fishing in year 2018

54
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,400
other known issues with passwords

55
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,180
including but not limited to social

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,950
engineering more where's key loggers

57
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:09,670
shoulder surfing if your password is no

58
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,290
longer safe due to a better wage

59
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,540
password check up gives recommendation

60
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,660
that you should change your password

61
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,548
immediately it's a prom extension by

62
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:25,100
Google I will recommend to select this

63
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:29,420
roles in cyber security system is only

64
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:32,540
as secure as a weakest link it has been

65
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:40,358
established that humans are still the

66
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:40,358
weakest cyber security length we can add

67
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,220
we can add multi-factor we can add to

68
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:49,930
multi layers of security to authenticate

69
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:52,639
and authorize user if one pointer fails

70
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:57,350
the second factor can still protect the

71
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:59,299
system home and not first entity because

72
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,310
of limited time I would like to refer

73
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,670
something you are authentication factor

74
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,959
to a talk social engineering and

75
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:09,950
emerging multimedia technologies

76
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,989
conducted last year here in besides me

77
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,709
on the speaker analyzed this

78
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:17,899
authentication factor in details

79
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:20,570
this is evolving technology in the talk

80
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:23,599
the speaker discussed tools which are

81
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:27,260
available to generate real-time fake

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,760
targets even some are using AI n in

83
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,310
future it could be possible to

84
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:35,349
impersonate any

85
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,350
two factor authentication is recommended

86
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,210
one of the influence behind this

87
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,400
research was an alternative approach

90
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:50,630
time of my studies as some as two factor

91
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,650
authentication won't work in low

92
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:57,380
coverage areas until you can receive SMS

93
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:02,150
for example in high tower buildings or

94
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,920
basements tracking subscriber location

95
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,770
obtaining call details

96
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,050
tapping intercepting text messages that

97
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:12,969
contain security codes are the harsh

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,390
work poorly with mobile phones people

144
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:46,040
don't want to use authentication that is

145
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:48,440
not seamless when I was looking for my

146
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,840
master master's thesis topic my

151
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,440
cards with smart phones as smart cards

152
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,800
are becoming new normal

153
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,170
identity smart cards does not require

154
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,810
batteries to operate and are protected

155
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:19,780
from all waves this is the basic

156
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:22,370
architecture of smart card open platform

157
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,729
the card manager is the code component

158
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:29,000
for open platform it provides interfaces

159
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:33,349
for one word services and interfaces to

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,010
the outside world a Java card Jacob has

161
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:41,419
a Java car virtual machine to run smart

162
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:43,640
card application written in Java the

163
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:47,360
function of security domains is to

164
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,520
provide keys and cryptographic services

165
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,810
for applications for example symmetric

166
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,810
or asymmetric cryptography

167
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,590
smart card microcontroller physically is

168
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:00,620
protected by different

169
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:04,130
layers or passive and active security -

170
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:07,490
which includes sensors embedded in the

171
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:10,790

two-factor authentication

191
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,209
most solutions are required to trust

192
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:19,370
third party we discuss SMS OTP and

193
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,050
observe the vulnerability Google

194
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,180
Authenticator does not provide mutual

195
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,000
entity authentication for example

196
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:31,640
attacker may gain access to shared kill

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,160
former death of break even even if we

198
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,990
implement two-factor authentication it

199
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,819
does not mean that we have secure

200
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,280
authentication with half secure

201
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,120
authentication if we design it securely

202
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:46,189
in this video two-factor authentication

203
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,140
implementation had a design flaw where

204
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:51,560
the client can send a random phone

205
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,449
number during the second factor flow and

206
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,579
the server sent the attacker the SMS

207
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,580
one-time password holding account

208
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,260
so this is quality peak just so this

209
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:19,730
this is our ability Justin isn't

210
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:22,040
watching we propose smart of

211
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,820
multi-factor authentication using smart

212
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:33,020
card and Android one F with public key

213
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:35,720
provided the architecture of smart auth

214
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:39,560
is designed to achieve security through

215
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,630
obscurity with PGI it is divided into

216
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,569
two parts

217
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:47,990
suicide user site includes Android smart

218
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,510
phone and smart card based on public key

219
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,330
infrastructure certificate authority to

220
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:56,090
verify entities we use open SSL gin to

221
00:11:53,330 --> 00:12:00,320
generate self signed certificate for

222
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:04,000
concept authentication server to

223
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:08,450
authenticate authorized entities

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,600
database of authorized users in center

225
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:14,660
we have smartphone running an Android

226
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,140
application I think as a medium to

227
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:23,060
communicate between web and smart card

228
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:25,670
for mutual authentication purpose smart

229
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,219
card module is to be responsible to

230
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:32,900
communicate between smart card Android

231
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:35,480
and Android over NFC for a successful

232
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,970
authentication Papa user the user is

233
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,850
required to authenticate first with

234
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,910
password on web secondly we then

235
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,970
authorize smart cards one smart cards

236
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:50,120
one smile are secondly with an

237
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:54,740
authorized smart card on web with smart

238
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:59,570
phone communication with smart card is

239
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:02,540
done by apdu commands IES odep is

240
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:06,050
required as android supports different

241
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:08,480
NFC technologies actually we had a one

242
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:11,660
problem while using smart card I had a

243
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,570
hybrid smart card which was also an RFID

244
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,650
and smart cards so as per Android

245
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,350
dispatch

246
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,600
for NFC technology because and have seat

247
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,480
there it was going to enough see death

248
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,760
and was not selecting as a smart card so

249
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,680
it was take a lot of time to figure it

250
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,680
out that actually we need to select

251
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:36,020
highest death for communicating with NSF

252
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:40,040
and also the smart card the smart card

253
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:44,439
has javacard PKI is a open source

254
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:47,029
project for the support with java and we

255
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:52,010
integrated smart web mail server got a

256
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:54,950
PKI project we follow Phipps one Lansing

257
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:57,920
protocol entity authentication using

258
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:00,320
public key cryptography Phipps 196

259
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:06,439
protocol was introduced and published by

260
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:08,450
list we have to end it is that we want

261
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:14,120
to authenticate virtually on web one

262
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:16,910
entity initiator a is suicide and the

263
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:21,920
second entity is user side responder B

264
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:23,569
which enclose Android and smartphone for

smartphone while a push notification

269
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:37,279
with a token ID Android responds with

270
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,480
token the a one and a random number RB

271
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,459
which is actually a random number

272
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:47,660
generator from smart god next several

273

276
00:14:53,300 --> 00:15:00,949
random number sent from smart card and

277
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:04,970
sends back to the smart home ok at this

278
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,890
step at this step when it receives the

279
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,380
smart the smart phone receives that

280
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:13,130
deserves it signature token a B it

281
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:15,920
verifies that it is validated and after

withdrawn because it has not been

319
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:24,290
updated since February 18 1997 we

320
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:26,780
continued with Phipps 196 as it still

formula

327
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,220
it provides better performance and

328
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:54,050
greater security with small key size as

329
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:58,820

how they can protect themselves from

341
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:38,130
different threads thus some references

342
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:41,178
and thank you very much

343

[Music]

344
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,550
how does it protect against man in the

345
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:01,340
middle attacks Italy yes it's a very

346
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,800
good question how this small talk can

347
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,889
protect men in the media as I so you see

348
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:11,540
we have a random number two if I can go

349
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:14,090
back to D this one for example this is

350
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:19,639
mutual entity authentication so we have

351
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:22,760
our a and our B then the signs are a and

352
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,600
it also sends the array within so there

353
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:29,090
is no like this is a rule cryptographic

354
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,730
secured random number so it sends from

355
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:35,659
server to the time and it has this own

356
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:39,140
RB which was sent in register in

357
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:43,820
previous strength now from sour hand

358
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:45,890
from its own both random numbers the

359
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,280
validate that is original and the

360
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:52,630
certificates are validated by CA in

361
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,629
architecture that we visit

362
00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:00,260
this one so the certificates are

363
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:02,510
validated from this one and the

364
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,200
signature is validated with I and our

365
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:09,260
way so it prevents actually the

366
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,049
mechanism so similarly the next step

367
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:15,559
next step is to reverse random numbers

368
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:18,860
like first it was RA because it was sent

369
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:25,668
from server next step is RB it is sent

370
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:45,709
from sign on our responder B so both

371
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:48,440
entities can verify each other actually

372
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,690
this is also a good question because the

373
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,820
approach we want to like provide a

374
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,860
solution for organizations they are

375
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,870
certificate authority they will control

376
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,120
like in this side architecture we are

377
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:01,820
not dependent on any third party of a

378
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,209
certificate authority organization and

379
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,490
have their own like I and it provides a

380
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,169
unified attend occasion for organization

381
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,720
for example we have Keith key cards

382
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:15,650
so in key cards employees always use but

383
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:19,030
there's like opportunity to use smart

384
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:22,160
cards on web we can use readers on

385
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:25,490
physical access control systems but with

386
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,340
the this gap so this solution actually

387
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,860
it's targeted for organizations that

388
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,720
they can use in point ID cards within

389
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:36,530
organization and this architecture is

390
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,530
totally dependent it is independent of

391
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:41,570
third party so they don't want to like

392
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:44,000
like if they want to have a physical

393
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,418
access they can use T card as a key card

394
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,880
and if they want to event accattone

395
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:52,580
organization's website they can use like

396
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,330
this solution on that and after after

397
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:58,040
also if the access is devote only one

398
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,168
click they all have access from

399
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,889
buildings physical access as well as one

400
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:06,730
harbour how like our unifor Unified

401
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:09,710
actually authentication for imagination

402
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:14,410
so this is certificate authority

403
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,410
paralyzation can have their own actually

404
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:44,360
but still is a one-time solution like

405
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,970
for example OpenSSL we can use for okay

406
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:50,330
we can have a central database that do

407
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:53,150
we can manage easily so like central

408
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:56,980
database for all employees sword movie

409
00:22:53,150 --> 00:23:02,230
or maybe less shortage validity of

410
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,230
certificates so then they can be like

411
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,109

[Music]

413
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,760
actually actually I do have I do have

414
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,350
with me if anyone interested convincing

415
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,290
no actually I did not implement that

416
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,780
idea got your own question we haven't

417
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,659
implemented anywhere but we all know

418
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:45,290
think we are trying to do this one and

419
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:47,540
I've already started like I have a this

420
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:51,110
one I don't have a white paper website

421
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:56,389
and interestingly coin smartcard coin

422
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:59,270
from litecoin so I want to let based on

423
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:02,000
this research I want you made smart card

424
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:06,100
wallet putting Bitcoin Club smartphone

425
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,870
so this will be like a product here

426
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:12,290
looking into thank you only thanks me

427
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:15,409
so like this is simple like the pros

428
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:17,090
would be simple this smart card wallet

429
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,850
we can sign transactions between

430
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:24,590
Schnauzer Chen over any cryptocurrency

431
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:27,469
the cross-platform cross-platform

432
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,149
support if we have mobile phone we can

433
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,060
sign it like putting your wallet in your

434
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:34,750
wallet literally so with mobile phone

435
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:39,649
with NFC you can sign your transaction

436
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:43,520
with for example POS we can buy products

437
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:45,770
from smart card model and similarly ATM

438
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,639
we can use like like people are already

439
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:51,500
familiar with credit cards and ATM

440
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:59,750
technology so it would be key to mass

441
00:24:51,500 --> 00:25:01,460
per mass adoption of cryptocurrency yeah

442
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,300
yeah right now right now we'll be

443
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,730
working on this tool like Java card

444
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:13,700
maybe later we might have a specific but

445
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:18,170
I right now we'll be working on this a

446
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:20,720
one project one project I think open HSN

447
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:24,010
I think they have they have an open

448
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,900
source project will be actually

449
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:50,920
integrating different technologies to

450
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:50,920
make it more seamless okay
