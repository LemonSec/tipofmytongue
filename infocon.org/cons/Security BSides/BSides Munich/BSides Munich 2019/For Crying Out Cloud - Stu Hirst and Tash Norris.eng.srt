1
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,759
thank you very much it's an honor to be

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,410
here actually this is the first time

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,240
myself and Tash have spoke together but

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,309
we speak separately at events in the UK

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,090
so to be part of these sites here is

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,189
awesome

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,529
- to whose task we are the cloud

8
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:21,390
security team a company in the UK called

9
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,970
photo box but there's actually five

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,409
brands that are part of that that group

11
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,009
one of which is here in Munich called

12
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:30,538
poster XXL we have a better split

13
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:31,439
presentation here around some of the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,600
experiences I've had

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,460
not just in in photo box group but in my

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,780
in my career and some of the learnings

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,520
that I've had and I think Tosh is gonna

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,900
expand on some of the the things that

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,490
she's been she's been part of so

20
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,500
hopefully there's a lot to learn and we

21
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,320
can share some of our our failures as

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,240
well as well as our successes and so a

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,760
little bit of background about me I've

24
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,920
been an IT for about 20 years but I've

25
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,260
only been in security about 7 or so so

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,790
I'm not an expert and I'm actually not

27
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,199
convinced that there anybody is in

28
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,540
security who's an expert because it's

29
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,910
such a difficult field and I say it's

30
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,799
there's so much to learn I do public

31
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,429
speaking I guess some of this this kind

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,549
of thing

33
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,829
I run a meet-up in Scotland which which

34
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,880
we get a great amount of people at I'm

35
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:13,288
one half of a thing called cyber

36
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,149
Scotland Connect which is around

37
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:17,069
building communities and bringing

38
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:18,869
organizations together in Scotland which

39
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:20,280
is where I live and I think that's

40
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,479
really important I think the keynote

41
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,179
today made some great points about

42
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,979
community and events and how important

43
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:28,530
that is to spread the message within

44
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,810
security and our wider industries and

45
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,880
personal lives I also run an AWS

46
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,009
security slack forum or I'm not sure I

47
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,509
run it I facilitate it there's a QR code

48
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,399
towards the end of this presentation

49
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,659
you're welcome to join I think there's

50
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:41,159
about a thousand people on there now

51
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:48,899
sharing all sorts of great information

52
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:50,880
and - hi yes sir I'm - um I am Kohli for

53
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,499
their OS women at sec London chapter

54
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,298
which is launching in April which is

55
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:56,429
really exciting I'm also on the board

56
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,380
for dev second which is a developer

57
00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:00,799
security and operations kind of combi

58
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,699
conference that runs around the world I

59
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,679
know there's a threat modeling staff

60
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,840
that's my passion so I work at photo box

61
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:08,970
which Jing and I'm in his class security

62
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,500
team but we are in a really small

63
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,790
security team which I imagine quite a

64
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,920
few of you might be able to relate to

65
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,660
and having come from a big kind of

66
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,890
corporate enterprise as previously a

67
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,410
financial services

68
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,720
moving to a really small team has been

69
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,850
quite an eye-opener for me and it means

70
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,310
that I don't just do kind of my segment

71
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,900
of security I also cover anything else

72
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,730
that kind of comes in I might be able to

73
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,510
touch them so threat modeling is

74
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,700
something I'm going to talk about a

75
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,560
little bit more later and it's been a

76
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,269
real way for me to engage with a lot of

77
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,590
different areas within the business and

78
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,110
how to support them and being more

79
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,840
secure so do some clouds tree stuff I

80
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:44,790
also speak a lot Arnon blue teaming and

81
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,710
cloud security so I'm really excited to

82
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,420
share with you and a little bit later in

83
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,970
this presentation some of the kind of my

84
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,100
favorite blue team tools and techniques

85
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,600
and that I use with the groups I went

86
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,840
with so I'm gonna have Matt sister who's

87
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,850
gonna kick us off cool so as I said we

88
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,980
have five brands in the photo box group

89
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,299
so I like memes by the way so that might

90
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,920
be some silly pictures and things

91
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,100
because we don't take ourselves too

92
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,929
seriously so we have five brands for

93
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,540
those brands or in AWS and I'll explain

94
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,760
a little bit more about that so joining

95
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,030
one company can be daunting but

96
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,970
generally it's one text back it's one

97
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:22,620
one serve code we've effectively joined

98
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,600
four companies at once myself and -

99
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,940
because group security sits over these

100
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,489
these brands and as I said four of the

101
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,130
500 in AWS so it comes with a stack of

102
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,610
complexity beyond perhaps what I've been

103
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,400
personally used to and some of those

104
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,959
things are not unique to covering lots

105
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,030
of brands this could be within your

106
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,550
organization so differing tech stacks

107
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,900
different program languages use a number

108
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,930
of different program programming

109
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,010
languages across the the group and

110
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,209
cultures you can have different cultures

111
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,280
within different teams within your

112
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,100
business let alone across different

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,650
brands different levels of maturity so

114
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,209
again some of our brands are new to AWS

115
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,930
or newer through AWS and some have been

116
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:05,690
in AWS for a number of a number of years

117
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,980
business structures different sets of

118
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:10,280
executives to speak to different boards

119
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,660
to have to go and fight for money at

120
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,570
different levels of knowledge and so

121
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,430
these are things across our group that

122
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,010
we that we have to try and them neat

123
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,090
neat the challenge for and from an AWS

124
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,360
point of view we have a number of

125
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:25,739
accounts spread across those four brands

126
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,440
one brand uses tariffs warm weather uses

127
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,610
cloud formation makes our lives a little

128
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,319
bit more tricky to try and strategize

129
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,759
cloud security and I'll try and explain

130
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,680
a little bit more about what I've tried

131
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:40,360
to do in the short time I've been in

132
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,490
this in this role so my initial journey

133
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,139
I actually joined as the head of

134
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,719
security engineer engineering at the

135
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:50,020
photo box group and realized there was a

136
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,659
gap potentially to do something in AWS

137
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,000
from a security side so I created a role

138
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:57,159
the role didn't exist I decided to go

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,659
and do it and then try and recruit to

140
00:04:57,159 --> 00:05:00,340
build that team and as etosha mentioned

141
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:03,400
were just a small team of two at the

142
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,599
moment and moon pick shifted their

143
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,758
height we're a high transactional

144
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:09,250
e-commerce website and shifting into AWS

145
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,669
the initial work that I did there was

146
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:15,400
not the sexy you know tooling tech based

147
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,830
side of things it was sitting in well

148
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,429
architected reviews with AWS it was

149
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,080
manually auditing accounts and setups

150
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:27,039
but it was the first time really a

151
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,438
security individual had been at the

152
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,590
company at that point in terms of that

153
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,330
the the maturity and the the movement so

154
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,799
it's really really important so if any

155
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,508
you're in that journey into the cloud

156
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,949
and you have the ability as security

157
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:41,560
professionals to embed yourself in that

158
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:44,080
at the the very early stages and it's

159
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,750
super important but what do you focus on

160
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,539
how do you know what to go after that

161
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,180
was the challenge I found myself having

162
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:53,620
um if anybody's this is an opinion as

163
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,810
opposed to a fact so if anybody would

164
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,069
like to share this out and this to me is

165
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,479
the most important thing that I've done

166
00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:59,919
in this company it's the most important

167
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,539
thing that I will do in my security

168
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,628
career what's the most important aspect

169
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:10,000
of securing the cloud anybody brave

170
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:12,639
enough to shout an idea out that's super

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,409
important that's crazily important it's

172
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,089
not it's not what's on the next slide

173
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:20,680
but so for me it's recruitment it's

174
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:22,210
getting the right people in to do the

175
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,710
job because if you don't have the people

176
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,109
with the talent and the skills or able

177
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,909
to learn those skills you're not going

178
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,289
to do all that great work that needs to

179
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:32,560
be done so for many greats that work

180
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:34,719
alongside - incredibly skillful skillful

181
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,860
person in the AWS space so for me

182
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:37,180
recruitments probably been the most

183
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,159
important part of the roles that I've

184
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,360
been a part of in security and the other

185
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:41,430
stuff is super important as well

186
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,490
obviously

187
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,660
it just need to say no so that that's

188
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,370
can it but that's a challenge and we

189
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,900
know that's a challenge in security the

190
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,520
diversity thing was talked about this

191
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,280
morning as well we continue to try and

192
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,750
work hard to make that better but yeah

193
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,250
recruiting talented people into your

194
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:02,520
teams is it super key that's what I try

195
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:06,360
to do was define cloud risk risk is not

196
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,130
a sexy word I'm afraid it's but it's

197
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,500
what will give you this strategy or the

198
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,840
ability to build strategies around what

199
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,979
you go after first you don't need to do

200
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,780
this yourself because there's a whole

201
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,219
stack of benchmarking out there or other

202
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,559
organizations that can help you with it

203
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,590
I found the CIS benchmarking for AWS

204
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:27,539
incredibly useful and what I tried to do

205
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:29,310
was really define around 50 to 60 major

206
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:31,349
areas that any business could be

207
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,300
concerned with from a pure AWS point of

208
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,220
view and this is - it touches great help

209
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,139
as well and we really split it into

210
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,970
these eight different areas of which

211
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,430
this won't be an unusual to anybody in

212
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,099
the AWS and it's really given me an

213
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,729
opportunity to focus on where our

214
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:49,199
particular sets of brands might want to

215
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:50,969
strategize and you can see that this

216
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,220
those eight different areas there now

217
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,449
I've put these into a document on github

218
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,580
you're welcome to have a look at it it's

219
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,500
just industry based it's not it's not

220
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,000
company specific but it gives you an

221
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,740
understanding of some of the areas you

222
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,800
might want to think about if you're an

223
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,630
AWS it's given me personally the the

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,030
ability to really think about what to go

225
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:11,520
after now I also want to talk about how

226
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,960
we how we work as a team because that's

227
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,060
really important and we're actually

228
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,380
really I think we're really agile small

229
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,760
team within our business we're an agile

230
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,190
organization anyway and that means

231
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,680
different things to different people but

232
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:25,800
with very heavy users of JIRA anybody

233
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,539
who follows my my boss Dennis Cruz will

234
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,139
know how passionate he is about mapping

235
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:33,750
things in JIRA so what I did was I took

236
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:36,180
those 50 or 60 potential you know

237
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,219
business industry-wide AWS risks and

238
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:40,348
link them in JIRA to our cloud

239
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,789
infrastructure higher level risk which

240
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,159
any business would have if they're in an

241
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,110
AWS we allocate management and technical

242
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,490
owners to those things well within jira

243
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,130
so that we can quickly see who's

244
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,690
responsible for what and then we link

245
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,470
our okay ours which has objectives and

246
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,150
key results for anybody who doesn't

247
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,800
you use those which are innocence

248
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,840
projects there they're the pieces of

249
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,849
work that we define to reduce those

250
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,170
risks and we link them to many

251
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,390
vulnerabilities were then find within

252
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,030
the business and track progress on those

253
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,350
pieces of work and that allows us to to

254
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,939
see the work that we're doing to

255
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,610
visualize it and to be able to track it

256
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,150
and see whether we're reducing reducing

257
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,920
these risks now we work in two-week

258
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,390
sprints which there's only two of us but

259
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,040
it works really well

260
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,290
this is not our Kanban board by the way

261
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,260
it's just the generic combine both bars

262
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,959
it's got far more in it so we split our

263
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,360
chaos into manageable chunks we break

264
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,530
those down and we do sprint planning but

265
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,150
we've also started bringing lots of

266
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,310
other things into our Kanban board mass

267
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:38,740
sprints so business as usual work work

268
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,239
we know we need to do team meetings

269
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,040
perhaps things where we do dedicate

270
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,040
quite a lot of time we've been our

271
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,959
incident work in if things happen

272
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,819
training and then we have a service desk

273
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,830
where other teams can create work for us

274
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,630
which which all comes into this that

275
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,400
these Kanban boards and allows us to

276
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:57,280
make decisions on what's more important

277
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,470
and I think it was better reporting to

278
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,790
the the people that need to see see what

279
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,960
we're doing I think security can be very

280
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,030
difficult to visualize what you've

281
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,740
achieved over a period of time and I'm

282
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:10,569
not saying sprint is a perfect way to do

283
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,800
it but it's working for us I think so

284
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,180
what I really learned over the last six

285
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,709
months been incredible learning curve

286
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,910
particularly because I don't perceive

287
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,710
myself to be an expert in some of these

288
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,000
areas your journey has to start

289
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,490
somewhere if you don't have a security

290
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,200
team dealing with AWS or cloud use you

291
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,700
should maybe try and consider how you

292
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,730
you make that happen especially if

293
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,110
you've got lots of data in there

294
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,990
changing businesses takes real time and

295
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,340
graft it's just painful it can take

296
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,280
years to change the culture of one

297
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,930
business let alone four or five own

298
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:39,490
people repeat mistakes I'm certainly

299
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,750
guilty of that as I'm sure anybody is

300
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,250
but we need to find a way to make that

301
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,010
better how do we either water make

302
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,410
procedures or processes to to prevent

303
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:50,770
people making same mistakes

304
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:54,069
cloud is hard and complex as is all of

305
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:58,600
security I think and recruitment for for

306
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:01,240
me is key so what's helped other

307
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,040
training platforms are available I find

308
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,110
these things super useful or invest a

309
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,709
lot personal time in in these thin cloud

310
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,570
guru for me of lei has been

311
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:12,890
has been great these are the must pay

312
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,149
them product cyber e is a free learning

313
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,980
tool there's lots of good videos on

314
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:17,630
there too to help you learning and part

315
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,850
of our roles is continuous improvement

316
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,649
in continuous learning I spend a lot of

317
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,360
time on YouTube and SlideShare watching

318
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,649
presentations from other people who fix

319
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,080
the problems that I'm trying to fix

320
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:30,020
because I can't spend all day trying to

321
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,500
make up ideas is to is it's too

322
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,939
difficult

323
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,610
other people have generally solved those

324
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,649
problems so I'm going to pass over to

325
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:40,520
Tash who's gonna give her version of the

326
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:42,050
story so I'm sure you did a great job

327
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,199
when he joined of kind of setting up

328
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:47,060
this the team this past routine that

329
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,920
didn't previously exist at all and then

330
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,329
defining some of the kind of security in

331
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,479
the risk areas and then I came along

332
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,890
about eight or nine months later and the

333
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,290
thing that I really wanted to talk about

334
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,779
with you guys today was based on that

335
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,490
kind of underpinning structure that

336
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:02,839
she's laid out how do we actually start

337
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,089
to really make a difference with those

338
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,220
teams and how do we guide them and the

339
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:09,529
first thing I learned was that I had

340
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,810
this preconceived idea that for our

341
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,100
engineers and moving to the cloud was

342
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,349
easy is just picking something up and

343
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,570
running with it and brought it actually

344
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,790
was like where's software engineers that

345
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,950
were previously just software engineers

346
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,469
that did their one thing became

347
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,360
infrastructure engineers database admins

348
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,830
back in engineers and you all of a

349
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,959
sudden become full-stack without really

350
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:33,380
being given the support and the guidance

351
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:36,020
to be able to help them so being a very

352
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,640
very small team I wanted to think about

353
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,040
the things that I could do to make an

354
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:44,360
impact in the quickest way possible with

355
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,949
our teams and without stretching myself

356
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,170
too thinly without filling up that

357
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,690
Kanban board too much which I'm still

358
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,680
incredibly guilty of and I wanted to

359
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,839
share my favorite things so the first

360
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,650
thing is my cloud security pyramid

361
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,860
scheme this is my my Ponzi scheme as it

362
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,420
were for security this is how I scale so

363
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,510
it's actually security champions but I

364
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:08,329
recognize that I am I am one and with

365
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:10,220
students just two of us by the top and

366
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,439
we work incredibly hard to be able to

367
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,079
kind of scale out and to expand that

368
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,820
team so I figured as I would just use

369
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,500
tougher engineers to do that for me and

370
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,380
when they're not included in the

371
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,350
security team budget which makes IC so

372
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,150
be happy um but - they're already

373
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,680
embedded within the teams they already

374
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,170
know what they're building best they

375
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,819
know way better than I could so we

376
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,709
created this cue champions program which

377
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,680
to its credit and to our Caesars credit

378
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:38,890
did already exist but wasn't very well

379
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,180
attended and became this way of security

380
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,970
teams just telling the engineers what

381
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,349
they've done wrong that week or telling

382
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,700
them the biggest vulnerabilities and

383
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,130
risks that were present that week for

384
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,750
our teams and what we actually did is

385
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,570
start to turn that around to become a

386
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,070
forum where we could share things we

387
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,600
were working on where we would encourage

388
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,610
our engineers to share things that they

389
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,560
were working on and even better we use

390
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,630
it to crowdsource problems and solutions

391
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,459
so we mentioned we have all these

392
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,660
different brands and they're all using

393
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,470
different tech specs that means

394
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:11,800
different CI CD pipelines we've got um a

395
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:13,150
huge spread of tools just tools and

396
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,400
languages that are being used which

397
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,660
means things it might be repeatable

398
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,819
within one company all of a sudden

399
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,260
aren't repeatable anymore but the

400
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,470
problems are still the same right the

401
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,520
problems of key management of

402
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,040
certificate rotation all of these things

403
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,360
are still there of encryption so what we

404
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,490
did is we would get teams to present a

405
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,930
problem that they've been facing and we

406
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,250
would crowdsource that solution within

407
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,170
the room to a point where we would get

408
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,460
where each of the brands had pulled

409
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,750
something from it they were happy with

410
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,790
and then they were gonna go away and

411
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,650
talk to their wider teams about what

412
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,329
that solution look like no longer did I

413
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:45,130
have to have the same conversation four

414
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,470
or five times but it was happening for

415
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,540
me it at one point and then spreading

416
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,400
out through our teams we doing some

417
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,890
interesting stuff with this gamification

418
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,079
and we've been looking at kind of how we

419
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,210
embed it within our engineering teams ok

420
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,100
ours the idea is empowering security

421
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,930
teams or engineering teams to become

422
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,270
your security SMEs within their

423
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,800
environments so that when they do come

424
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,020
to you it's for those bigger things is

425
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,880
for those niche problems there's really

426
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,680
interesting questions but the rest of

427
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,300
the time they are your eyes and ears

428
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,209
within those teams and empowering them

429
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,520
themselves so it really well so far

430
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,830
anyway the other thing I've been doing

431
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:23,189
is threat modeling and hands up anyone

432
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:27,160
who knows what a threat modeling is

433
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:28,960
awesome say I'm busy don't know and I'm

434
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,209
gonna be guilty this there's a whole

435
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,540
load of different frameworks and ways to

436
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,060
threat model

437
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,439
I tend to introduce it is quite a simple

438
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,768
process and I'll cover that in the next

439
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:43,010
slide but my favorite thing about it is

440
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:44,630
that everyone already does it and for

441
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,100
those of you that have a question

442
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,899
earlier about how you get more women in

443
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,190
your teams let me tell you the women

444
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:51,199
that are looking join your company are

445
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,209
threat modeling you so they're looking

446
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,399
at where your office is what your team

447
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:57,199
is like the things that you do and

448
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,490
they're doing a risk based decision on

449
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,609
whether or not they should go enjoying

450
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,860
things like your job descriptions a

451
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,970
threat modeling that and I'm looking at

452
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,160
all of those things you've gotten there

453
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,079
in your required section which you know

454
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,339
that you're not gonna hire but you put

455
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:12,739
it in your required section a knife

456
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:14,180
threat model that and I think well I'm

457
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,550
not gonna meet all of those things in is

458
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,519
required section so I might not apply if

459
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,990
you think about when you go on a flight

460
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,519
somewhere where you park your ass at

461
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,649
your car somewhere you threat model that

462
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:26,269
situation and you think about what are

463
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:27,860
the things that could go wrong or what

464
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:30,740
are the things that could happen if I if

465
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,519
I do that thing what might not happen if

466
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,230
I do that thing

467
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,300
so threat modeling is something that is

468
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,639
very real I'm very natural to a lot of

469
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,500
people and what I do in teams is I just

470
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:41,720
add a framework and a structure around

471
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,209
that and what it does it allows those

472
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,100
teams to get up skilled in security it

473
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:48,888
allows me as a by-product to learn a lot

474
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,050
more about what they're doing like for

475
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:53,510
me it's been a really great way to kind

476
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,069
of expand the relationship and the way

477
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:59,089
that teams reacts in behave with each

478
00:16:55,069 --> 00:17:00,979
other so how do I do it so I just use

479
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:02,930
for questions I use a really simple

480
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,910
methodology and then I partner that with

481
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,948
something called stride so my four

482
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,809
questions what am i doing what can go

483
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:11,179
wrong what can I do about it and did I

484
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:12,949
go do a good job and I say I a lot here

485
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:15,380
but I get this stuff for engineers to

486
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,290
answer this question so I get a whole

487
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,390
team a whole squad in a room and I get

488
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,010
them to sit and I I ask them why are you

489
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,660
building joy up for me show me the

490
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,679
architecture or a data flow diagram

491
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,260
whatever it might be

492
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,820
and then I think what can go wrong most

493
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,940
software engineers will have in their

494
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,559
head these niggling oh okay as long as I

495
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,030
don't get too many requests their API

496
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:37,010
and pointed be fine as long as no one

497
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,110
works out that really complex URL will

498
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,370
be fine or whatever it might be and this

499
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,439
is a great way of pulling

500
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,918
out and actually walking through okay

501
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,419
what are the problems with that things

502
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,340
I've seen previously with public s3

503
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:52,159
buckets or public objects in a three

504
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,649
buckets is teens saying things like well

505
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:57,409
it's a really obscure URL and he'll not

506
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,750
find it and we know there are sites like

507
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,940
grey hat warfare where it will enumerate

508
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,100
and scan for public objects

509
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,630
they've got crazy complex URLs there's

510
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,250
stuff that's it's just not safe and

511
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:10,130
threat models is a great way to pull

512
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,690
that out we always make sure that we go

513
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,929
through mitigation options the final bit

514
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,340
is the did I do a good job it's a really

515
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:18,020
great way to get that team together and

516
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,149
understand is this working for you is

517
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,980
threat modeling a useful exercise what

518
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:23,750
tools can we use to make it better and

519
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,840
there are some tools that I use with

520
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:29,240
teams that helped you make us find to

521
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,590
help make finding threats much easier

522
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,809
and much more straightforward and I'll

523
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,189
cover those off but if I could recommend

524
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,168
you take one thing away if you're not

525
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,210
doing this already threat modeling is a

526
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:40,130
great way to scale that security piece

527
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,340
and it is also a great way to build

528
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,809
relationships with your teams so does

529
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,809
anyone actually read your security

530
00:18:44,809 --> 00:18:48,649
policies anyway and this is the biggest

531
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:51,408
thing when I was doing the threat

532
00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:54,559
modeling where's seams we pull things

533
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:55,850
out like a lack of encryption or public

534
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,029
objects or whatever it might be in a guy

535
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:01,219
this is simple stuff and across the

536
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:02,600
companies that I work for I kind of

537
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,140
realized that all of our security

538
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,879
policies are these huge bloated

539
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,250
documents that actually have the

540
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,899
security team haven't even read and

541
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,490
someone from a policy team I've put

542
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:15,649
together or it might be something pulled

543
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:18,169
directly from a policy pack online and

544
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:20,928
it's actually unreadable or unmanageable

545
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:22,850
so I figured when I'm doing these threat

546
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:25,100
models and we're finding these bags I

547
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:26,539
can't really rely on our security

548
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,889
policies just to support that so I

549
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:29,960
thought well how do I they're still

550
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,179
useful and I still need them from an

551
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,760
audit requirement piece how do I

552
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:35,809
actually make them consumable so one of

553
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,510
the things that I'm working on at the

554
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:40,789
moment is writing tests so this is an

555
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,649
example of a BDD test from that I was

556
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:45,289
cloud security projects but effectively

557
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:47,029
rather than encouraging engineers to

558
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:48,770
read these huge policy documents are

559
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:50,630
incredibly boring how do I write

560
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,889
automated tests in a language it's

561
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,299
already familiar with our engineering

562
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,789
teams whether that's

563
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:59,899
tdd whether I'm doing Ruby Python

564
00:19:55,789 --> 00:20:02,029
whatever and how do I kind of automate

565
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:04,459
that findings and the great thing about

566
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:06,889
cloud is we've now got infrastructure is

567
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,149
code so previously where my test might

568
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,559
have just been up to it an application

569
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:12,110
layer I can run these tests against

570
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:13,428
terraform or CloudFormation and we have

571
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,508
to write because we know with all these

572
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:17,360
friends that we've got all this

573
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:19,399
fragmentation i hands out to automate

574
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,918
finally security vulnerabilities but i

575
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:23,658
can also rewrite some of our security

576
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,429
policies into a way that's much easier

577
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:27,019
to read because the other thing about

578
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:28,789
these standards is the language is so

579
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:31,009
formal and complex that it's not even

580
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,509
really consumable so this is something

581
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:35,989
that's been really powerful for helping

582
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:37,940
those teams the other thing is gamifying

583
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:39,830
security these are elevation of

584
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,619
privilege cards by Microsoft these are

585
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,359
free so you can get these from and from

586
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:46,908
github from Microsoft website and I'll

587
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:50,299
share a list of all the resources at the

588
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:53,059
end and these follow the categories I've

589
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:54,408
stride which is spoofing tampering so on

590
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:56,658
so when I'm in a threat model am I

591
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:58,309
thinking what can go wrong and I do in

592
00:20:56,659 --> 00:20:59,749
step 2 of that model and teams of

593
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:01,549
struggling to think of security issues

594
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:04,220
because they're they're not security

595
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:06,200
experts these are a great resource for

596
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,239
helping them to think of different and

597
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,830
attack vectors or different threat

598
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:11,629
vectors and they're really just prompts

599
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,809
some of the language in them is a little

600
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:16,998
bit and I want to say archaic but they

601
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:19,460
were they were built quite a while ago

602
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:20,749
and but they're great problems they help

603
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,519
teams to kind of really quantify

604
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:25,789
denial-of-service problem and when we

605
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:28,129
think about services like lambda and AWS

606
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:29,658
where if you've got a lot of lambda

607
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:31,939
invitations happening once you can hit a

608
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:33,739
throttling problem which can be quite

609
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,059
serious it's something that Netflix came

610
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:36,799
across through at the very beginning and

611
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:40,129
then expanded this whole architecture

612
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,259
idea of having many many AWS accounts

613
00:21:40,129 --> 00:21:44,299
for one application on one service and

614
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:46,220
but these are a great way to kind of

615
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:47,749
build that out and bring those threats

616
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,789
out during the design process you don't

617
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:50,989
even have to wait until they've built

618
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:52,908
something and that was the thing that I

619
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:54,200
found with the test is I had to wait

620
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:56,389
until they don't already start to build

621
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,679
the code and now I'm bringing it into

622
00:21:56,389 --> 00:22:02,389
the design process I thought about this

623
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:05,359
a little bit more and I thought these

624
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:06,750
are great but I'm still relying a lot on

625
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:10,350
the language and I

626
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,460
still they're not cloud specific so I'm

627
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,409
gonna introduce you something that I've

628
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,540
been working on I've not yet released it

629
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,630
so you have to be patient if you like it

630
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,740
um but I wanted to show you something

631
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,300
that I thought might take this to the

632
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,450
next level um and I'd love to invite you

633
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:27,030
to contribute as well so I've been

634
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:29,940
working on cloud security elevation of

635
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:32,010
privileged cards so this is a way of

636
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,690
taking that gamification a level Fair

637
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,190
there and the same with the original

638
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,290
elevation of privileged cards you can

639
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,360
almost play it like a car game you can

640
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:42,120
get points but the language wasn't

641
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,389
really that great so I've been working

642
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,100
on a Tobias specific threats and I've

643
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,710
also been talking to someone from from

644
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,120
Asia and luckily from Google I felt

645
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:55,020
really guilty about being here at Google

646
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,419
and speaking a lot about Amazon but I've

647
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,850
been looking at how do I create a BBS

648
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:02,490
specific threat vectors that will prompt

649
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,230
engineers to think of okay what would

650
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,910
happen if this happen in my environment

651
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,830
am I asking for authentication

652
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:10,350
authorization every layer my inherently

653
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:14,909
trusting and what's coming am I using VP

654
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:16,590
cm points and have I got public objects

655
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,270
rather than you know I've checked it on

656
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:21,050
my buckets on public and that's fine but

657
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:25,050
can anyone release any objects anywhere

658
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:27,780
so we created these cards and which will

659
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,100
hopefully be really soon open source and

660
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,090
I'm looking for contributors to them so

661
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,740
if there's something that interests you

662
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,870
and you're going across this let me know

663
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,940
and you can absolutely contribute to it

664
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,350
but already kind of doing quick trials

665
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,500
with teams there's been really positive

666
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,730
way for them to identify and come up

667
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,850
with threads that can help make us more

668
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,260
secure so these are my favorite

669
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:49,139
resources and things I've not mentioned

670
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,820
and POW custodian which is in the top

671
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,950
one there when I talked about writing my

672
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,409
tests at the beginning of the abeer DD

673
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,300
what this does is I then implemented

674
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,910
they are lambda function within the AWS

675
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,220
account itself so if I've missed it in a

676
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,080
test phase I can have a lambda function

677
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,620
that continually scans for public

678
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:11,189
objects in s3 or unencrypted EBS volumes

679
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:13,290
or overly permissive ion rules is really

680
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,480
customizable so whatever you can think

681
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,250
of you can you can alert on it you can

682
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,350
also make it preventative so rather than

683
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:21,179
just sending off an SNS net

684
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,699
earmuff you've got an unencrypted object

685
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:25,590
you can get it to just kill the ec2

686
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,679
instance and terminate the violet volume

687
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,760
which is a little bit intense and but I

688
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:31,590
found it really useful for those

689
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,080
high-risk environments you can get it to

690
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,908
be really preventative on that side just

691
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,939
make sure your engineers are super happy

692
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:40,080
for you to do that before you do it and

693
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,360
the only other thing I want to call out

694
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,100
on there is security monkey this is a

695
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,469
Netflix tool for security

696
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:50,209
has anyone ever configured Netflix

697
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:54,320
security tools before yeah it's awful

698
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:57,179
so no documentation is really awful

699
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,039
scream on key especially realize one of

700
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,960
the dependencies they have they rely on

701
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,730
a very specific older version it's not

702
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,679
version pinned and it took me a really

703
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,679
long time to work that out when I was

704
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:09,270
trying to get it to work and however it

705
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,940
is pretty cool once you get it up and

706
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,408
running in AWS it's really cool and I

707
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,100
would just if you're ever looking it can

708
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:18,179
forget a Netflix tool there's loads of

709
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,120
complementary blogs by people that have

710
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:23,940
got really pissed at Netflix and then

711
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,080
rewritten their own deployment stuff but

712
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,419
it is really cool once you get it

713
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:32,549
running these are my favorite resources

714
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:36,720
I think that's it from us and anything

715
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:38,970
else I'm do come and chat to us is where

716
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,770
we have an office it poster in Munich

717
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,090
and we work for these other brands as

718
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,590
well and them if you've got any

719
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,449
questions about the stuff we do in AWS

720
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:48,389
let us know you'd be more than welcome

721
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:50,370
to join our slack forum and it's gerunds

722
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:51,450
there's a representative some of those

723
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,760
different companies in there and they

724
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:56,490
cover a lot of different topics and just

725
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,169
news about Kyle and there's some Azure

726
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:01,110
and Google forums I believe on there as

727
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:02,190
well nothing more for me that was

728
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:06,080
awesome thank you very much I think

729
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:06,080
thank you thank you - see

730
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,960
probably actually have time for three or

731
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:20,350
four questions so your hands up please

732
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:23,790
if you have questions by them sorry I

733
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:29,669
have a question what's your go-to tool

734
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:31,870
about visualizing architecture in AWS

735
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:35,429
how how do you go about this

736
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:37,419
yeah is a saccade mapper and cloud craft

737
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:39,520
which you've been quite good for putting

738
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,100
out the architecture I must admit when I

739
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,200
do a threat model I make people draw it

740
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,520
and that's because about five or six

741
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,100
years ago I had the case of the missing

742
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,870
firewall which is a box that made it so

743
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,270
away somehow from an original draft

744
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:55,570
design to a design that was a proof but

745
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:57,460
never actually built and no one could

746
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,620
answer about me so I get people to draw

747
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:01,210
it in every threat model anyway and the

748
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,428
cloud mapper especially has been been

749
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,510
really good I think that's as a small

750
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:05,860
team that's a really important thing

751
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,300
because it improves our learning but it

752
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,790
improves the the engineering teams

753
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,470
learning as well we're in a sort of

754
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:13,000
tricky position about what tooling to

755
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,490
add at any point in time with it as a

756
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,670
small team because it takes effort to to

757
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:20,110
be on top of it okay so I see a question

758
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,800
here are there other questions in the

759
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:25,000
room that I even made me missing you're

760
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,240
welcome together afterwards we'll be

761
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,240
here all day

762
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:35,500
hi so I've got a question about the

763
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:37,300
secure champions area and forgive me if

764
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,040
I missed it in the presentation so how

765
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,379
did you actually approach teams about it

766
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,970
hey I've got this cool idea that I want

767
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,600
you to start doing you know how did that

768
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:48,970
conversation start say and it's a good

769
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,040
question because it can be really hard

770
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,370
to get people to invest time in security

771
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,860
right

772
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,139
am I missing it before I took over the

773
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:59,620
forum people were what I'd like to call

774
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,210
voluntold so rather than being

775
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,820
volunteered they were voluntold by

776
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,230
someone and what happened was there was

777
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,610
a conversation with leadership and

778
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,960
leadership were really behind it but

779
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:11,110
there wasn't really a conversation in

780
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,070
engineering level so people didn't

781
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,870
really put themselves forward so they

782
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,200
were voluntold and what I've been

783
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,679
starting to do is work on the PR of the

784
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,420
security team

785
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:23,090
and that's really how people today I

786
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,560
want to have more conversations the most

787
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,970
accessible thing I think I've done so

788
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,530
far and it's a bit cheeky because it was

789
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:31,070
really recently is I held a lock-picking

790
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:32,330
workshop and so just in our breakout

791
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,310
space and I kind of where people eat

792
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,780
their lunch I had a message earlier in

793
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,330
the week and I got it kind of in their

794
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,649
car off this newsletter and did some

795
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,730
stuff on slack and I was like I'm just

796
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,230
gonna be doing some lock-picking

797
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:44,510
workshops if anyone wants to come along

798
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,640
and learn about lock-picking and then

799
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:48,020
once I got them there I was like are you

800
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,270
gonna have to learn about this scheme

801
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:53,060
and but that was really fun because I

802
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:55,940
got people from marketing design our UI

803
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,050
UX teams as well as tank and for me for

804
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,940
the security champions to be really

805
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:01,129
successful I need people from everywhere

806
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,960
in the business including those people

807
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,390
that come up with his crazy new products

808
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,040
that we should all work on and I wanted

809
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,860
them to engage in chat to us as early as

810
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,629
possible so I would I obviously have

811
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,889
these conversations with leadership to

812
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,290
say hey this should be part of your

813
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,540
objectives and this is really important

814
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:20,210
and I can help you find bugs earlier

815
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,770
shift and left all of that stuff and but

816
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,990
then I would just go on like a marketing

817
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,310
rampage and do this stuff like free

818
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:27,110
lunches and all that stuff that

819
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:29,270
shouldn't have to work but you gotta do

820
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:32,060
but honestly the lock-picking stuff I

821
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:34,760
got stuff Amazon for like the equivalent

822
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,169
of like 60 euros so load of padlocks the

823
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,180
load of pics and I'm home loads of

824
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,380
people and that was there I think so far

825
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,080
that's been the best way of pulling

826
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,730
people in I agree I mean we've got an OK

827
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,649
are specifically on with cork we're

828
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:46,910
calling it our PR campaign and that's I

829
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,050
was trying to get around all those

830
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,120
different brands and all the areas of

831
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,889
the businesses in ways that worked for

832
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,260
those parts of the business because as

833
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,670
you say some things work for one team's

834
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,900
other things you know don't work for

835
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,580
others there are different technical

836
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,410
levels different levels of ability and I

837
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,600
think I've had a similar experience in

838
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,760
other companies where during a training

839
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,199
course over the fence and hoping that

840
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,940
somebody's gonna complete it and be

841
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,590
enthused by it doesn't actually really

842
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,120
work you've got to find other methods to

843
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,770
engage with teams in whatever way that

844
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,050
is now it is a big commitment in time

845
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:17,480
they it's a huge part of our of our

846
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:18,889
roles from a time commitment but yeah

847
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,450
things like the log picking it just gets

848
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,620
people involved and they realize that

849
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,420
actually a lot of what we do is not

850
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,679
boring and it's not dull and we're not

851
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,020
trying to tell people to not do their

852
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,300
jobs so yes just trying to ping people

853
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,950
on that journey I'm gonna do a bit of a

854
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,639
shameless plug in the lock-picking part

855
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:34,250
I

856
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,950
you think we don't have luck they fix to

857
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:39,800
lock to lock thing right now but there

858
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:41,900
are a few logs that need to help the cat

859
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,669
escaped from the box that you can do

860
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:47,000
from the online challenges so please

861
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:48,680
check out the CDF afterwards and doing

862
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,200
lock-picking worships could be an idea

863
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,780
for next year so if there are experts

864
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,490
here or maybe you want to visit us again

865
00:30:52,780 --> 00:31:00,350
it was maybe one question here and

866
00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:02,210
that'll be the last one I have a

867
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:04,100
question is that you're using Jireh for

868
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,080
tracking their phones did you have to

869
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,699
like customize it how do you write the

870
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,639
phone's first can you talk more how to

871
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:13,840
set up yeah we've heavily customized do

872
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,880
we have all sorts of ticket types and

873
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,290
labels and tagging and yeah it's quite

874
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,350
heavy actually in terms of how we use it

875
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:23,120
with that I saw bosses create a tidge

876
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:24,649
it's called the GS bot so it's a bot

877
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,540
that allows you to quickly create

878
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,640
tickets and link things together which

879
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,860
has been really really clever but yeah

880
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,630
that's taken time to do yeah we've Kabir

881
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:35,240
it's like but they're queries I'm the

882
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,980
GAAP I and then we would say like show

883
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,800
me threats related to be created IT

884
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,900
assets and threat ticket types so I when

885
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,810
I do a threat model I have an idea it

886
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,970
could be like a particular container

887
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:49,070
cholesterol whatever and then art I'll

888
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:51,260
link my threats to it as your ticket so

889
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:53,419
then teams can link their stories to fix

890
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,650
today's so then I can create a slack bot

891
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,620
and I can be like showing me all the

892
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:58,670
threats related to this asset and we

893
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,929
encourage the business to do that too

894
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,460
and then you can see all the threats and

895
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,800
the stateís what I've been fixed what

896
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,270
stories it's really cool and doesn't get

897
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,970
a lot when I'm like this is all the

898
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:10,760
stuff you do and Dennis is created so I

899
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:13,430
see so who did a lot of the underpinning

900
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,800
of that that geo taxonomy and it's got

901
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:18,920
some slides on SlideShare and I'll

902
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,740
retweet them today slavish pug from my

903
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,510
Twitter and I'll retweet them today and

904
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,300
so you can see a little bit more info on

905
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:29,390
how we do that geo taxonomy there I've

906
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:33,200
seen all the linking as well as probably

907
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:36,190
are killing the find or break coming

908
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,190
soon thank you very much
