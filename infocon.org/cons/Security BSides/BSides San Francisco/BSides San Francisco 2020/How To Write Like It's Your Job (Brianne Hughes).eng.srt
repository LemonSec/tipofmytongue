1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,210
please welcome Bree from Bishop Fox all

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,309
right hello security riders we're here

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,139
today to consider some aspects of

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,428
writing and editing that wherever you

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,500
are in your career you may not have

6
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,039
focused on before let's check out a map

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,320
of our general trajectory underpants you

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,060
the first draft space using guides and

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,970
fresh eyes to edit yourself and what to

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,439
do if you need more so our first stop

11
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,390
underpants in an episode of South Park

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,278
tiny gnomes sneak into kids rooms to

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,750
steal Underpants why would they do that

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,370
they explain it's step one of their

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,170
business plan which is missing a crucial

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,690
middle part between collection and

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,430
profit my conceit here is that you right

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,199
now basically hack all the things in

19
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,059
step one and you want payment and

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,559
closure for that in Step three but if

21
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,449
you don't use step two to consider the

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,578
quality of your work if you turn in your

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,500
first draft as your final draft people

24
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,210
will be less inclined to pay you and let

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,129
you move on they'll want to go back to

26
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,300
step one and scrutinize what you did and

27
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,460
make sure it's worth paying for

28
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,959
but if you have a real plan you make

29
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,699
your work with care you look brilliant

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,739
in step three you keep everything moving

31
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,270
and most importantly you get paid for

32
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,159
your time and can work on the next thing

33
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,929
for more about what happens when you

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,460
miss the middle step you can look at my

35
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,560
cactus con talk from a few years ago

36
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,179
called chaos on the machine it's a jolly

37
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,430
twenty minutes about the value of making

38
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,720
security writing more transparent for

39
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,159
this talk let's just agree that you

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,900
should avoid writing breaches with a

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,420
double e and we'll focus on the

42
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,970
solutions so what's our new plan it's a

43
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,380
five-step plan our goal is to make

44
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,880
something good to produce quality

45
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,920
content that reflects the quality

46
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,750
research business experience and

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,610
expertise that you put into it so first

48
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,909
we're going to focus on you and how you

49
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,049
make things then we got to make a thing

50
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:42,090
then we need to focus on how to make

51
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,490
things good how to set up ourselves for

52
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,380
success so that in the fourth step we

53
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,390
can execute on that plan on the things

54
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,798
we've learned and do them resulting in a

55
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,500
beautiful thing that does what you want

56
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,149
it to my hope is by recognizing these

57
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,829
steps every time you walk through them

58
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,710
you'll be able to see the profit at the

59
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,449
end of the tunnel so the first step of

60
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,100
our new plan is knowing how you make

61
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,930
things as a writer and the first step of

62
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,000
that is admitting you're a writer you

63
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,290
might categorize yourself as a bad one

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,270
but it still makes you a writer

65
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,270
acknowledge that it's an aspect of your

66
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,230
job in emails meeting notes CFPs cover

67
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,690
letters and bugs

68
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,060
reports you write admit that embrace

69
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,700
that before we can achieve a gleaming

70
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,159
palace of paragraphs though we need on

71
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,929
how you write what is your process right

72
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,760
now if you don't have an intentional

73
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,799
process there's still a pattern you can

74
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,870
notice about the time of day or place or

75
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:32,459
format you choose to write in what keeps

76
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,950
you motivated and what stops you from

77
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,720
trying anymore it may be ad hoc but it's

78
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,609
kept you employable so let's find the

79
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,310
outline of your current underpants known

80
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,480
plan before we flesh it out if you've

81
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,280
never checked in with yourself about

82
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,679
writing start to notice your patterns

83
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,180
and emotions about them just get to know

84
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,160
what you're working with are you great

85
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,780
at starting terrible at finishing big

86
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,670
procrastinator but you always pull it

87
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,590
out at the end somehow maybe there's

88
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,358
someone you go to to bounce rough ideas

89
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,549
off of or someone you know to only show

90
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:01,170
the final version to you may even find

91
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:02,519
you're carrying around grammar pedantry

92
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,890
from a teacher that's not doing you any

93
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,079
good take inventory of your writing

94
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,510
assets they may seem small but they add

95
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:11,370
up to a universe of productivity look at

96
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,899
a recent email blog post or report

97
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,519
you've written and consider what areas

98
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,470
you're confident in and which ones you

99
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,840
avoid or struggle with what's working

100
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,930
for you right now today how do you

101
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,160
communicate on paper over time you may

102
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,139
start to see that you fall into the

103
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,940
extreme edges of the ranges here you

104
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:29,040
might write to casually for reports or

105
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,299
to seriously in emails you could be so

106
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,530
brief that the reader doesn't feel

107
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,150
they've gotten their money's worth or

108
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,769
you could write so much that they feel

109
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,329
like they've walked five miles and ended

110
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:37,950
up in the same place these are

111
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,349
independently moving ranges all

112
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,488
combinations are possible basically you

113
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:43,560
want to be somewhere in the middle on

114
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,090
all of them if thinking about your

115
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,530
current writing style this way is tricky

116
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,019
you can make a list of things you enjoy

117
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,120
or struggle with in writing instead for

118
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,709
example I enjoy giving talks because I

119
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,930
naturally write in a conversational

120
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,910
manner but I need outside accountability

121
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,849
to keep me honest and my talks always go

122
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,590
over by a minute as you figure out your

123
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,720
strengths the strategies that might work

124
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,190
for you will become more obvious like if

125
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,290
you feel lost when you sit down to write

126
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,609
you may need to take detailed notes as

127
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,429
you're doing the testing so you don't

128
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:12,569
have to remember the facts on demand or

129
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,310
you may need to let the experience

130
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:15,780
simmer before writing so you shouldn't

131
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,690
beat yourself up for not sitting down

132
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,769
immediately after the event before I

133
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,839
move on I want to briefly address

134
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,760
writers who learn English as a second or

135
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,289
third language as I hope you can see

136
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,969
from this talk already writing is

137
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,289
legitimately difficult for everyone

138
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,140
so tackling it in a second language

139
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,610
takes real focus and work make small

140
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,710
goals so you can celebrate small

141
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,120
victories of progress and look back on

142
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,400
old writing to see how you've matured

143
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,050
give yourself even more time for your

144
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,700
writing process ask for peer feedback

145
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,490
and take notes on what you learn from

146
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,469
each document I also recommend that you

147
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,150
get more formal English in your head

148
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,220
little things like prepositions

149
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,020
irregular verbs and idioms are hard to

150
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,700
just memorize but if you listen to

151
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,099
things like grammar girl structured

152
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,539
podcasts about security old DEFCON talks

153
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,220
or anything else you're interested in

154
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,660
those little building blocks will come

155
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,020
to you more easily when you sit down to

156
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,670
write all right we're all writers before

157
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,820
we can make a good thing we need to make

158
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,800
a thing let's write the first draft how

159
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,170
do you start writing though blank pages

160
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,130
are terrifying here's how you write a

161
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:19,440
draft you write it jump in do work where

162
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,210
you can do work right now maybe you can

163
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,040
knock out an outline or the main point

164
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,750
of the report in casual language like

165
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,940
hey company don't use that third party

166
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,290
vendor or your scope was a joke do this

167
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,840
test again with a realistic set of

168
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,130
targets in draft two you can make those

169
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,810
phrases more diplomatic

170
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,909
but don't censor yourself in draft one

171
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,090
get the core guts of your message out on

172
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,740
the page on that note the biggest hurdle

173
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,419
I see stopping technical writers is

174
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,880
dressing up their language before

175
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,950
they've put on their underpants be comfy

176
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,570
in your first draft the stiff formal

177
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,130
wear of these phrases can restrict your

178
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,110
ability to move around and early drafts

179
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,419
by focusing too much on the way you

180
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,860
think you should be writing don't worry

181
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,049
about misspellings don't look for better

182
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,450
synonyms just use a verb you can readily

183
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,620
think of and leave a note for later none

184
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,599
of the things on this slide are

185
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,520
inherently good or bad but you might be

186
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,770
over relying on them to sound confident

187
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,150
just consider that they're repeated use

188
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,460
and misuse and they actually be

189
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,140
weakening your points don't use bits

190
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,400
you're not sure how to use just write

191
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,260
down what happened as well as you can

192
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,289
and save the formal wear for the editing

193
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,150
process for the things you don't want to

194
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,250
do or can't immediately dive into in the

195
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,500
first draft mark them as spots to fill

196
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,180
out or improve later I recommend using

197
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,919
comments rather than highlighting or

198
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,660
bolding for this because those tools

199
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,590
eventually lose their power to stand out

200
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,450
and can sneak through to final versions

201
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,669
ok so you've written the first draft now

202
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,820
what well to make things good you have

203
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,700
to make room to make them

204
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,230
like many many business failures errors

205
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,849
often get through because catching

206
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,920
errors wasn't a defined part of the

207
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,630
process if it's no-one's specific

208
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,790
responsibility it's not surprising that

209
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,740
it doesn't happen you have to make it a

210
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:55,270
deliberate step the biggest point of

211
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,980
this talk is that if you want to improve

212
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,380
your work which is what editing is

213
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,720
you've got to make space for it such a

214
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,890
downer I know and it's good to admit

215
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,600
that you might hold a grudge about

216
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,950
editing it's not the reason you get up

217
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,810
in the morning it's a barrier between

218
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,370
you and the next fun thing and honestly

219
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,230
people can be cruel in their blood

220
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,970
feedback you may have had a teacher

221
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,980
dismiss you as a writer or a colleague

222
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,890
give you a vague comment like this is

223
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,200
bad fix-it reviewing an edited text from

224
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,510
unscaled editors can be demoralizing and

225
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,099
yet editing is such a crucial part of

226
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,260
refining your craft and succeeding at

227
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,000
your job rebound from those literary

228
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,070
traumas by learning to find the useful

229
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,500
feedback below and be grateful when you

230
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,599
get to work with professional editors so

231
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,030
let's make some space for editing we're

232
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,260
gonna focus on three ways here first you

233
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,330
need to know how much time you have

234
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,580
total so you can carve in time to edit

235
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,680
this can seem simple but little admin

236
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,390
tasks can cut off fractions of days and

237
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,370
really affect how well you can finalize

238
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,110
your work before the deadline get that

239
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,940
information up top and clarify when

240
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,560
necessary you need it you need to know

241
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,530
the real schedule so you can plan your

242
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,240
attack and wrap it all up at the end -

243
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,890
you can make space by creating your own

244
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,720
schedule within the official timeline

245
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,310
set up chicken meetings with your

246
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,380
project partners talking through your

247
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,390
topic can often clarify your message and

248
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,950
shake out forgotten points keep the

249
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,690
meeting short and then you can use that

250
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,310
blocked off time to make headway on the

251
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,600
next section or review your work with

252
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,480
fresh eyes while you'll feel that

253
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,920
momentum and build out generous amounts

254
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,810
of time in your schedule for your

255
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,090
colleagues to review your work peer

256
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,040
editing can be rough so keep it focused

257
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,650
by asking for feedback on specific areas

258
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:30,010
you're working on your introductions

259
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:32,020
transitions or technical explanations 3

260
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,789
save time during editing by spending

261
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,189
time now to get to know your tools

262
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:37,510
better all word processors have little

263
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,340
tricks that you may not be taking

264
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,020
advantage of set it up so it's your

265
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,940
friend not your enemy during deadlines

266
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,470
if you're using something daily it's

267
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,850
worth looking up tutorials to get

268
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:48,040
comfortable with the various ways to

269
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,080
view and format your work for example

270
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,640
how to customize your spell check

271
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,140
settings how to bring the common

272
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,390
functions you use onto the

273
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,100
quick access toolbar shown here how to

274
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,870
use track changes and its different

275
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,710
markup views how to talk in comment

276
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,030
threads how to accept changes okay so we

277
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,370
have allotted time for editing and

278
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:08,500
you've written the first draft it may

279
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,120
not be pretty or concise or completely

280
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,200
filled out but it has the beating heart

281
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,390
of the message you're trying to get

282
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,450
across now we can talk about making it

283
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,710
good first drafts do not make good final

284
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,750
drafts because they're really you

285
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,130
telling the story to you you can use

286
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,440
shorthand you can assume that the

287
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,490
timeline main sense and just focus on

288
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,870
the parts that interest you because

289
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,520
you're the one who experienced the

290
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,260
exploit it's like if you write a

291
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,090
shopping list that just says milk but

292
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,340
then someone else has to go buy it what

293
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,750
percent what size did you mean almond

294
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,310
milk these are the kinds of

295
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,080
clarifications that a technical editor

296
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,729
would ask you about and that you have to

297
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,110
take a step back and ask yourself if

298
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,390
you're going to edit your own work and

299
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,250
to do that you need to be different from

300
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,660
who you were when you wrote it so the

301
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,640
first thing is let's use some of that

302
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,939
space we allocated earlier to let our

303
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,439
draft rest so we can really improve it

304
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,060
the amount of time here is not crucial

305
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,950
you just want to give yourself a chance

306
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,569
to separate yourself and live a little

307
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,310
so that when you come back you can

308
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,740
experience the document like a new thing

309
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:04,390
if you edit right after writing you'll

310
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,280
miss boodles of errors because you

311
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,830
haven't distanced yourself enough and at

312
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,270
the same time you'll burn yourself out

313
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,190
sleeping on it really does help but

314
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,600
going for a walk playing a game singing

315
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,160
or dancing can make you feel like you

316
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,620
have something new to offer when you

317
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,780
come back if you're short on time

318
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,820
consume the document in a new way by

319
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,630
listening to it out loud or changing the

320
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,030
format you're viewing

321
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,680
reading out loud or having a computer

322
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:31,270
speak it back to you is the absolute

323
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,739
best way to edit yourself why when you

324
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,480
silently read something back to yourself

325
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,820
that you've just written you fill in

326
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,390
gaps and you miss words this triangle is

327
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:43,240
a classic example of that I love Paris

328
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,220
in the springtime oh dang there are two

329
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,930
those in that triangle but because of

330
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,370
the line break your brain kind of half

331
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,530
remembers that little word and lets it

332
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,420
slide during a quick scan but it sticks

333
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,220
out when you read aloud you're so

334
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,780
embedded in your topic that you won't

335
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,660
see or hear these little connecting

336
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,770
parts that you just assume are right

337
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,329
beyond typos there are a lot of

338
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,579
eccentric there's a lot of eccentric

339
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,920
jargon in security that you may not hear

340
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,550
is strange anymore when those terms like

341
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,800
sniffs

342
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,449
run pickling pop up out of context that

343
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,939
can confuse new readers or be

344
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,320
unexpectedly suggestive the words that

345
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,750
make them up don't have to be inherently

346
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,540
vulgar but in InfoSec terms I recommend

347
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,480
watching out for our penetration dump

348
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,699
leak Jack and dangal four of which were

349
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:31,029
combined in an end gadget headline last

350
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:33,910
summer according to a hot dongle leak so

351
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:36,070
a slogan for editors is read stupid

352
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,899
think dirty if there's a confusing or

353
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,490
vulgar interpretation of a sentence

354
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:40,990
people will find it and then they'll

355
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,120
talk to you about that instead of what

356
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,769
you intended for them to focus on these

357
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,209
phrases make you memorable as a writer

358
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:48,220
but it's probably not the kind of

359
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:49,810
attention you wanted so read your work

360
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,200
out loud to hear what it really sounds

361
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:54,790
like by letting it breathe and reading

362
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,410
it out loud you get to experience this

363
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,209
document like you're totally new to it

364
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,550
and when you hear it for that first time

365
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:02,859
capture your reactions if something

366
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,810
seems off like this map it's probably

367
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,640
off you don't need to know the solution

368
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,109
to the problem right away but you do

369
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,699
need to mark it before you get too

370
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,310
comfortable on the document again and

371
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,200
forget some questions to ask yourself is

372
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,689
the sentence so long I run out of breath

373
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,089
do new topics appear out of nowhere our

374
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,920
terms used inconsistently are their

375
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,410
repetitive phrases about attackers

376
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,180
attacking and users using right those

377
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,100
initial reactions down even if it's just

378
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,140
a keyboard smash comment in the relevant

379
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,540
place that's what I do on my first pass

380
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,699
you can run spellcheck to mark potential

381
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,319
problem areas - and while we're on the

382
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,970
subject let's look at what guides and

383
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,390
tools can and can't do for you in the

384
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:42,250
writing process there are so many gray

385
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,350
areas and nuances to language that

386
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,660
unfortunately no one tool can fully

387
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,430
replace a human editor so I recommend

388
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,380
you use a combination of reference works

389
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,120
existing tools and your own custom

390
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,670
checklists during your editing and

391
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,459
finalizing phases the benefit of an

392
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,529
existing tool is it already exists the

393
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:01,359
possible negatives are that they don't

394
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,519
work with your specific vocabulary or

395
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,170
custom formatting and in the case of a

396
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,209
tool like grammarly they check your

397
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,829
writing remotely so if you're dealing

398
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:11,768
with client sensitive NDA type

399
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:13,209
information it's not the tool for you if

400
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:14,980
you are in the market for some readily

401
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,469
available guidance though I'm going to

402
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,420
suggest to that I helped create the

403
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,930
cybersecurity style guide is a friendly

404
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,490
PDF

405
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,899
with 2,000 terms how to write and

406
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,399
pronounce them what they mean in

407
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:26,230
different contexts which ones to

408
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,899
consider avoiding this is a page of

409
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,399
entries from bootloader to be sides and

410
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:32,680
appendix at the back has further

411
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,450
resources for technical writers books I

412
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,790
recommend and other modern style guides

413
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,620
that can support your work the second

414
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,420
tool here is cyber dick which is a

415
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,339
dictionary file that augments your word

416
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:44,380
processor spellcheck by adding those

417
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,300
2000 terms from the style guide directly

418
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,860
into your local dictionary that can keep

419
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,880
away those distracting red squiggly

420
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,490
lines while you're working on your

421
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,990
drafts these are both available now for

422
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,850
free I made them to make my own life

423
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,190
better and I'm happy to make the writing

424
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:00,910
price process less painful for you going

425
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:03,100
forward the reason I recommend using a

426
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,439
combination of reference works tools and

427
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,240
custom checklists to navigate is because

428
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,910
there really are no rules only

429
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,740
guidelines I really mean that English is

430
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,750
a wild and greedy language and there

431
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,310
aren't many hard rules it's good to

432
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,630
reference industry standards but you

433
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,310
shouldn't feel trapped by them if

434
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,020
they're outdated or don't apply to your

435
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,979
situation

436
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,270
sometimes in writing it feels like

437
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,610
you're searching for that one perfect

438
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,050
word or phrase but the reality is there

439
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,820
are a thousand ways to write a sentence

440
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,439
that could serve your purpose many

441
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,940
answers are right it just depends on

442
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:36,130
your goal your audience and your

443
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:37,779
timeframe it's an editor's job to keep

444
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,939
the final audience in mind all the time

445
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,680
the changes they suggest are not really

446
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,390
about an editor's personal peeves or

447
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,870
preferred sentence structure it's about

448
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,279
fighting for the user like Tron you want

449
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,140
your future reader to get your message

450
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,810
to do that you need to keep them engaged

451
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,370
focused and on track sometimes this

452
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,319
means cutting out parts you loved but

453
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,120
aren't relevant or rearranging your

454
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,400
structure to explain the basics up top

455
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,170
before diving deep a lot of this comes

456
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,270
down to keeping a specific audience in

457
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,370
mind is this for CISOs developers

458
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,589
Instagram influencers or your elderly

459
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,940
family members even if you hope everyone

460
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:11,589
will read it you should be a realistic

461
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,540
about what level of reader you're aiming

462
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,250
for it affects everything from word

463
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,319
count to format to how many of those

464
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,380
fancy trap words you feel obliged to put

465
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,120
in the final draft the best way to note

466
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,800
to fight for your user and keep them on

467
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,029
track is to give them context so they

468
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,709
know what you're going to tell them in

469
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:28,990
what order and why it's important a

470
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:30,640
comment overall strategy here is to use

471
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,680
parallel structures if you were making

472
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,640
three points you should use a single

473
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,880
system

474
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,649
point one point B and lastly including

475
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,720
sections like a tldr or walkthrough up

476
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,910
top are also good ways to clarify time

477
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,040
and place don't suddenly teleport your

478
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,630
reader without warning laying out these

479
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,360
roadmaps is about setting expectations

480
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,310
and then meeting them if you don't

481
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,779
provide a road map you might lose your

482
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,540
reader in what are called garden path

483
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,459
sentences you the writer know what they

484
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,230
should say but the twists and garden

485
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:00,430
path sentences mislead until the end

486
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,519
which can make your reader do a

487
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:05,469
double-take let's look at two the team

488
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,690
found oh the team found something a

489
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,610
vowel and end point oh they found a

490
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,510
sample application where was it hidden

491
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,300
why does it matter

492
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,709
ooh this sentence is not about finding

493
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,719
an application this is about finding

494
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:18,250
something within the application so

495
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,459
we'll add a little word up top to make

496
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:23,230
that more clear early on the team found

497
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:25,510
that the sample application had a

498
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,579
problem in this example the name of the

499
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,019
team application and problem are short

500
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:30,699
but this type of sentence structure

501
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:32,769
appears all the time and technical

502
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,660
writing with complicated noun phrases in

503
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:36,399
each slot and your readers will get lost

504
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,709
if you don't keep them in mind and hold

505
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,180
their hand through long sentences if you

506
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:41,680
find yourself needing to give extra

507
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,660
context in the middle of an important

508
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,719
sentence I recommend putting it in

509
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,790
parenthesis or its own sentence or in

510
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,529
the footnotes separating secondary facts

511
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,000
in parentheses or note sections keeps

512
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:54,250
your main message clear and keeps your

513
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,680
reader on the path all right example 2

514
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,720
the overall security of the external

515
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,279
network was excellent sometimes the

516
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,690
sentence itself is clear but it's true

517
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,699
meaning isn't known until something

518
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,709
later if I read this as a client I'm

519
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:07,089
happy I'm mentally resolving this report

520
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:10,209
in my head and moving on with my day

521
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,349
next sentence the team extracted 60,000

522
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,089
social security numbers from the

523
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:15,010
internal network dang you just

524
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,230
sucker-punched your reader it's not kind

525
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,730
like now they feel betrayed you sweeten

526
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,770
them up with a compliment and the rest

527
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,579
of the organization is on fire let's

528
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,319
rephrase this

529
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:26,349
although the external network was well

530
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,389
secured the team extracted so much from

531
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,889
the internal network now we anticipate

532
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,809
the bad news we're not whipping the

533
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,460
readers expectations around it's the

534
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:35,020
same core information but you've given

535
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,419
it context you've prepared the reader

536
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,040
and you look like a professional you

537
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:40,150
haven't ruined someone's day now you've

538
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,610
just laid out the strengths and

539
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,640
weaknesses to a CSO so they can act on

540
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,229
this information this level of paying

541
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,510
attention to sentences that sound

542
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,130
could be daunting but in general editing

543
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,780
technical documents comes down to

544
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,220
simplifying your structure so that the

545
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,320
only thing that reader is having to

546
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,910
spend brainpower on is the concepts in

547
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,850
your sentence not the sentences

548
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,280
themselves break up sentences use strong

549
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:05,199
verbs pull long lists out into bullet

550
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,700
points and use transition words to keep

551
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,700
your reader flowing smoothly through

552
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,830
your document as you're wrapping up your

553
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,540
close reading of a document go back and

554
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,040
read the beginnings of everything not

555
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,870
just the intro paragraph but the first

556
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,000
sentences of every paragraph and the

557
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,709
headings for each section reading those

558
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,419
bits back to back separate you from your

559
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,460
role as writer again and let you see

560
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:27,460
what the reader is likely to take away

561
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,780
from your piece in the end lastly go

562
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,520
through a finalizing process you've

563
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,410
decided on ahead of time that uses that

564
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,139
combination of spellcheck pre-made tools

565
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,669
and custom checklists if you can look at

566
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,590
your work in a PDF and scan it for

567
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:40,390
visual consistency make sure all the

568
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,189
figures look like right proofread the

569
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,570
cover page the dates the heading titles

570
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,100
the table of contents and the figure

571
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:46,750
numbers to make sure that parallel

572
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,418
structure and consistency is happening

573
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:53,169
headlines are a common blind spot that's

574
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:54,520
how you get hot dongle leaks and it's

575
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:56,530
good to check that your legally covered

576
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,240
make sure that your redacted content is

577
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,889
really redacted and not just covered

578
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,650
with a black bar those can be removed

579
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:04,570
from PDFs and remove metadata so clients

580
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:08,440
don't know you name the image idiot

581
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:09,340
client JPEG you can't edit forever and

582
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,290
there's always something else to

583
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,209
consider improving in a document but at

584
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,860
some point you have to stop there are a

585
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,210
million tips and tricks and editing but

586
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,010
I don't want you to be overwhelmed here

587
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,049
this talk is to help you view the width

588
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,190
of when an editor considers so that you

589
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:23,770
know in the future that there are

590
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,240
strategies and resources to turn to it's

591
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,220
not just you struggling to write it's

592
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,650
everybody and even editors argue about

593
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,540
what matters most so with you as my

594
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,610
reader as my intended audience in a

595
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,110
movie theater let's take a step back and

596
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,840
look at the big points of editing before

597
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:40,418
we wrap up the whole talk for editing

598
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,939
read your work out loud capture initial

599
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:44,890
reactions read stupid think dirty use a

600
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,370
combination of guidance remember your

601
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,230
audience

602
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,090
keep your actions clear by keeping your

603
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,440
sentences short read the beginning at

604
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,299
the end and finish strong with a

605
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,970
checklist so you don't undermine all the

606
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:56,950
good work you just did what if you need

607
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,159
more than your editorial abilities can

608
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,159
offer

609
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,780
there are amazing freelance technical

610
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,780
editors in the world that can help you

611
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,490
hire them if you do that or if you

612
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,230
already have access to an editor through

613
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,030
your work you should give your work to

614
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,890
them in the best possible condition and

615
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,690
include notes about what's missing and

616
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,910
the aspects of writing you're working on

617
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:22,200
editors are powerful but they are not

618
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:23,850
ammunition omniscient so the new plan to

619
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,300
fully dress up our documents in more

620
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:29,070
than just underpants one learn how you

621
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,040
make things by knowing yourself as a

622
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:34,470
writer to make a thing in this case a

623
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,570
bad rough draft three make space for

624
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,850
editing and prep your tools so that in

625
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,790
four you can edit and finalize that doc

626
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,810
and profit from your hard work I thank

627
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,879
you for your patience through this

628
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:47,010
obstacle course of writing writing is

629
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,810
ridiculously hard it's hard for me just

630
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,520
know that there are resources and

631
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,169
strategies you can implement today to

632
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,790
make this aspect of your job less

633
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,800
painful and there are things you can

634
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:57,389
quantify about yourself that you can use

635
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,430
to decide which of those will be most

636
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,960
likely to help you you're all writers

637
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,420
and I wish you the best as you continue

638
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,220
on your lifetime of writing editing is

639
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,200
hard and I empower you to improve your
