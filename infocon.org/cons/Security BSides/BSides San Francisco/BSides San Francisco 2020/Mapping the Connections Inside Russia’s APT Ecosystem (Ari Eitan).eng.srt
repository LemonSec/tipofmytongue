1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
thank you very much for attending this

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,710
session this talk titled the red square

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,040
mapping the connections inside Russia's

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,759
apt ecosystem let me give you a short

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,939
introduction about this talk so in the

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,300
last 15 years many Russian operations

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,980
and more families were publicly exposed

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,740
by different security vendors and

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,099
intelligence organizations now those

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,668
publications focused on specific Russian

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,250
actor or operation but the bigger

12
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:39,029
picture remains unclear which is the

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,940
Russian apt ecosystem as a whole we

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,940
wanted to get a better understanding of

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,309
how this ecosystem looks like in terms

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,070
of the connections between the different

17
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,530
components and that is why we conducted

18
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,020
this research I'm really happy to be

19
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,870
here today and to show the results and

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,960
I'll also present several open source

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,170
tools that we built during our research

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,010
and now can be used by you guys the

23
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,390
community for further investigation but

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,409
before we start I would like to

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:16,140
introduce myself my name is alia tan and

26
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,869
I'm the VP of research at integer I

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,210
usually present this talk with a Thai

28
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,479
coin a security researcher researcher

29
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,658
from checkpoint now this research is a

30
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,009
result of a collaboration made by

31
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:31,470
checkpoint research group and integers

32
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,020
research team which was led by a Thai

33
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,390
here and Raymond bethought from our side

34
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,970
and in total we worked on this research

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:44,130
for a few months so let's start as I

36
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,070
said we wanted to detect connections

37
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,869
between different Russian entities right

38
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,779
such as a pair of malicious samples

39
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:54,689
whole families and even between Russian

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,149
actors themselves but what is the

41
00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,020
connection a connection can be shared

42
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:03,090
module tool or even a specific

43
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,250
implementation of a function our

44
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,229
research was very wide and we weren't

45
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:12,270
limited to one type of connection we had

46
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,870
many questions in mind that we wanted to

47
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,030
answer

48
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,760
for example all the different Russian

49
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,440
government entities working alone or are

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,280
they sharing code and techniques with

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,810
each other and if so what artifacts

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,209
libraries and code are more likely to be

53
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,019
shared between two different actors or

54
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,819
two different tools can we support a

55
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,489
known connection between two different

56
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,470
actors but from a technical perspective

57
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:40,170
and not from the intelligence

58
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,450
perspective and and so on and so forth

59
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,738
we ready we really had many questions in

60
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:49,200
mind all those questions led us to start

61
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,540
reading public information that was

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,849
shared by other vendors researchers and

63
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,890
even government's regarding Russian

64
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,950
attacks there is a lot of information

65
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,048
available out there so actually that was

66
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,119
the first step we took and it was a very

67
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,250
important one so I would like to thank

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,870
all the amazing researchers who

69
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,310
published regarding Russian attacks in

70
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:14,220
the past years now after days of reading

71
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,859
background materials and publications it

72
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,799
was clear to us how we should proceed

73
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:24,090
towards this goal of mapping the Russian

74
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,819
ecosystem now to put it simply we split

75
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,340
the research into four steps the first

76
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:32,010
step is to collect samples that we know

77
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,620
were attributed to Russia then we need

78
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,230
to classify those samples which may

79
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,530
sound easy but it was a tricky step and

80
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,030
I'll elaborate on that next we want to

81
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,109
find the code similarities the

82
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,200
connections between the different

83
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:51,090
samples and lastly analyze the

84
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:54,869
interesting and relevant connections so

85
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,750
let's start as I said we first stage was

86
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,910
to collect samples we extracted IOC s

87
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,880
from all the reporter we read and then

88
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:06,450
we had to grab the actual samples the

89
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,900
binaries for many sources overall we had

90
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:13,858
approximately 2,000 unique samples to

91
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,649
work with now the next step was to

92
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:19,019
classify those samples and although it

93
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:21,988
may sound easy right since the name of

94
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,659
the attack appears in the reporter we

95
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,280
grabbed the aisle seats from classifying

96
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:26,680
the samples turned out to be one of the

97
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,809
most

98
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,050
complicated parts of this research all

99
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,000
right and I'll explain why first of all

100
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,050
there is no naming convention for Mauer

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,030
and threat actor in the InfoSec industry

102
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,250
every mouth family and every actor have

103
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,130
more than one name given to them by

104
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,960
different vendors some vendors will be

105
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,240
used different names to describe the

106
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,710
same family and other Mauer families

107
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:56,620
simply do not have a clear name so those

108
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:59,710
issues and more made us face one of the

109
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,830
most painful drawbacks of classification

110
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,780
and required us to be very careful when

111
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,590
we classify a specific piece of malware

112
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,090
to a family or an actor but actually

113
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,179
naming convention was not the only

114
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:16,090
problem and sometimes we discovered

115
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,900
problems with the IOC all right there

116
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:21,789
were two generic or even wrong and since

117
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,169
we needed to know exactly what every

118
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:29,050
sample does we we had to dive in deeper

119
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:31,060
so we did and we build this template for

120
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,460
pieces of information that we wanted to

121
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,919
collect for every sample of Russian

122
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,320
model that we had

123
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,330
first of all actor which actor is known

124
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,180
all likely to have written the smaller

125
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:47,859
for example Tula gray energy surface II

126
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,630
and and so on next family what is the

127
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:54,400
common family name that is associated

128
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:56,800
with the smaller module many more files

129
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,448
are built in a modular way in which the

130
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,759
Mauer can load a specific module

131
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:03,430
embedded in it or download the module

132
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,560
from a situ server and we wanted to know

133
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,830
whether the sample we have is a

134
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,509
keylogger module or communication module

135
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:15,159
an injection module or anything else

136
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:17,080
and lastly version now some our files

137
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:19,960
have a clear version Stamper bedded in

138
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,770
it and when possible we wanted to be

139
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:27,280
able to be able to differentiate between

140
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:29,639
earlier and recent versions now at this

141
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,799
point we classified all our samples into

142
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,919
60 families and 200 different modules

143
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,770
and then we were ready to move on to the

144
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,549
third part which is finding the code

145
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,258
similarities for that we used integers

146
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,780
genetic malware analysis technology

147
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:49,900
which basically means that for every

148
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,179
sample of malware that we collected we

149
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,580
automatically disassembled and they

150
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,210
sectored each binary into thousands of

151
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,849
small pieces of assembly we refer them

152
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,008
as genes and then we search in which

153
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:05,289
other malware samples Russian samples we

154
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:08,650
have seen those genes in the past using

155
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:11,229
this genome database now this database

156
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,388
contains genes which are the assembly

157
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,699
fragments from both malware files

158
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:19,120
including Russian files but also from

159
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:21,580
legitimate software which helps us to

160
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,530
focus only on the unique and malicious

161
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,090
code that was shared between the

162
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,590
different Russian samples right without

163
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:32,258
wasting time on shared library code like

164
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,909
open SSL for example so eventually we

165
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:36,460
were able to connect different Russian

166
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:40,479
samples based on their pure assembly

167
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:42,460
code and every connection means that

168
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,979
we've seen those genes only between

169
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:47,289
those two Russian samples and not in any

170
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:51,849
other malware which is now Russian right

171
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:52,360
or or a trusted software so it's really

172
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:56,259
powerful

173
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,539
connecting the samples based on that but

174
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:00,520
actually it was a bit more complex that

175
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:02,909
some of the south of the files were

176
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,318
packed and samples were packed in order

177
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:08,069
probably to stay evasive so we had to

178
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:11,440
unpack them automatically statically or

179
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:14,919
dynamically and the output of this

180
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,319
process was a list with pairs of samples

181
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,419
that pair pairs of Russian samples

182
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,819
that share code with each other so the

183
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:27,669
next step was to make this list to a

184
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:29,979
craft so now we had a decent amount of

185
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:32,260
connection to analyze and we came upon

186
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,899
this open source software called Gaffey

187
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,779
which is how many of you are familiar

188
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:40,260
with getting yeah okay so Jeff is a

189
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,880
platform to visualize and analyze graphs

190
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:48,220
so we downloaded it and loaded our data

191
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:51,160
and then we got this as a result which

192
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,920
is obviously not practical there's

193
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,860
nothing we can do with it

194
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,750
so we applied some graph layout

195
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,570
algorithms to the graph in order to make

196
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,700
it usable as you can see here and that

197
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,100
was the result

198
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:09,440
we could start spotting some clusters

199
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:13,640
and even connections which was nice but

200
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:17,600
we're still missing the context so we

201
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,780
added labels and colors to the graph and

202
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,510
now we were ready to start analyzing the

203
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,370
clusters and connections the colors here

204
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,069
represent the different Russian actors

205
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:33,170
so it's very easy to find the

206
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:35,300
connections in a visual way now there

207
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,479
are three types of connections on this

208
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,910
graph the first one which is the most

209
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,390
obvious one for us is when two samples

210
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:47,270
are of the same actor and Malware family

211
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:50,000
right the second type of connection is

212
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,370
when two samples are of the same actor

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,890
but of a different family and the third

214
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,990
type of connection which is obviously is

215
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,210
the most interesting one for us is when

216
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,430
two samples share code and belongs to

217
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:03,470
different family and different actor

218
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,890
those are the type of connections that

219
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:10,160
we're looking for now before I show the

220
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,840
results of this analysis we did let me

221
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,469
introduce you with our first open source

222
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:18,650
tool our present today so we took this

223
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,840
huge map from Gaffey and we turned it

224
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:22,640
into a web-based map where you can

225
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,240
interact with it and conduct your own

226
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,360
analysis let's have a quick demo of it

227
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,330
first of all it's live apt echoes

228
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,370
ecosystem calm so you can try but I

229
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:38,180
already prepared it and this is how it

230
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:40,880
looks like and in this in this graph

231
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:44,300
every node is am our family and not a

232
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,120
sample that's why you see less nodes

233
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,069
than the previous graph but you can zoom

234
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,050
in and start spotting the connections

235
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:56,870
and for this node for example I can

236
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,839
immediately see the name of it the actor

237
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:03,500
the other connections that it has to

238
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:06,450
other samples and once I click on that I

239
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,040
get the sidebar with some more and

240
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:11,880
Meishan regarding this specific

241
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:15,079
mouthwash remedy so I can see some

242
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,280
synonyms because remember there is no

243
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,820
standard for naming convention in the

244
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:24,449
industry a short description of them our

245
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:27,650
family some references that we recommend

246
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:30,270
to read and of course links to the

247
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:33,180
platform where you can conduct your own

248
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:36,600
analysis and see the generic report of

249
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:39,120
the specific sample and connections now

250
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,600
the map the map and the road data are

251
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,360
both open source so you can use it you

252
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,790
can conduct your own analysis and

253
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,180
they're all available on our github so

254
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:57,420
please try it and give us your feedback

255
00:11:50,180 --> 00:12:01,290
and yeah that's about this map so now we

256
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,900
have this huge map of connections and we

257
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:06,000
were ready to start analyzing them and

258
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,400
for us as reverse engineers it's where

259
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,590
the fun part begins

260
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,920
so we analyzed and analyzed many

261
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:15,960
connections and we really hope to find

262
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,569
some groundbreaking findings some new

263
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:22,560
and undetected connections that nobody

264
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:25,470
ever mentioned before but unfortunately

265
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,359
I don't need a boyfriend to our

266
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:31,290
disappointment we couldn't find any

267
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,840
cross actor connection and we couldn't

268
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,670
find that two different actors operating

269
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,030
under the same Russian umbrella our

270
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,890
sharing code with each other make it

271
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,569
stop

272
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:47,010
we did find many indications that two

273
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:49,710
different families operating under the

274
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:57,960
same actor are sharing code but not

275
00:12:49,710 --> 00:13:00,630
between the different actors so at first

276
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,610
we were quite disappointed by this

277
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,370
result right because we really wanted to

278
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:07,500
find some new and and undetected

279
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,890
connection but then we realized that the

280
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,510
fact that no code was shared between the

281
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,640
different Russian actors is an

282
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,030
interesting conclusion by itself right

283
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,180
and then we started to ask ourselves why

284
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:22,250
why the different Russian actors

285
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,500
are not sharing code with each other and

286
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:28,190
while we could come up with some

287
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,140
theories the truth is that we really

288
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:34,850
don't know and of course we don't have

289
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:38,180
anyone to ask but we do have some

290
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,870
theories the first theory is that Russia

291
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,439
is well aware of the importance of

292
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,470
operational security

293
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,200
OPSEC now let's have a quick pros and

294
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:53,780
cons of the decision not to share code

295
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:56,330
in terms of object so Russia knows that

296
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:59,360
in case of sharing code between two

297
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:01,040
different actors if if one actor would

298
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,830
get caught it will put the other

299
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,300
operations at risk right and this is

300
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,810
obviously something that would like to

301
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:12,050
avoid and by separating the code base

302
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:14,900
they can make sure it won't happen but

303
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:17,479
of course it comes with a cost and a

304
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,270
very expensive one because if this

305
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,330
theory is true it means that Russia is

306
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:26,120
willing to invest time efforts and

307
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,910
man-hours in having different teams of

308
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,790
Malwa developers writing the exact same

309
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,079
functionality over and over again

310
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:36,890
instead of just sharing code between the

311
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:39,650
different tools now the second theory

312
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:42,500
that we have is completely different and

313
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:45,199
in this theory Russian organizations do

314
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,660
not share code due to internal politics

315
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,930
this could happen but again we don't

316
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:55,089
know that for sure and I just wanted to

317
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,089
put it on the table as an option

318
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:06,700
so unfortunately we couldn't find any

319
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,320
unknown connection an undocumented

320
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,470
connection but we still analyzed many

321
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,750
samples and many connections and we

322
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,630
wanted to do something with it so we

323
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:20,410
wrote another tool by having access to

324
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:22,630
thousands of samples we were able to

325
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:25,569
tell which genes which are the assembly

326
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:29,620
fragments per sample which genes are the

327
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:33,010
most popular per family so we wrote the

328
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:36,070
apt detector which basically what we did

329
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:38,890
is we grabbed the most popular genes per

330
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:40,720
family and then we automatically

331
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,660
generated yahwah rules based on those

332
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,430
genes we merged all the yellow rules

333
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,670
from all the different Russian families

334
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:51,459
into one yellow rule set and we rubbed

335
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,380
it with Python and executable and now

336
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:55,359
it's ready to use you can use it to scan

337
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,330
your systems and to make sure that

338
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,800
you're not infected this tool by the way

339
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:03,330
is there are cross-platform so you can

340
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:07,569

344
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:15,640

345
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,430
example and deploy them in any other

346

system that you may have or conduct your

347
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:26,229
