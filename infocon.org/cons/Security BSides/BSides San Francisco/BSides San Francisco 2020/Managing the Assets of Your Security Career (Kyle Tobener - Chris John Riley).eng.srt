you like you said my name is Kyle Tobin

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,869
er I've been at Salesforce for nine

23
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,640
years and a manager for five I'm the

24
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,040
director of our enterprise security team

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,979
which is vendor security application

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,380
security and a few other things I first

27
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,470
started as a zoologist in my life and

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,460
failed at that miserably so now I'm here

29
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,259
you can see a fun little picture that

30
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,169
are included and I'm also an art

31
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,729
collector of 90s cyberpunk art so that I

32
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,049
threw on some of my favorites there was

33
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,048
awesome on this big screen

34
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,119
one other thing to know about me I

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,210
really loved strategy strategy board

36
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,240
games especially and I think this really

37
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,030
informs how I operate as a manager a lot

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,320
of the times I have a board game meet up

39
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,850
that I've been running for multiple

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,220
years is now the biggest board game

41
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,289
meetup in San Francisco and so I'm very

42
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,210
deep into the board games I love it but

43
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,470
when I'm working I often think like I'm

44
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,119
playing a board game and I ask myself

45
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,070
what are the rules of whatever I'm doing

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,320
and how do I win how do I'd win most

47
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,270
efficiently and that was kind of where I

48
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,639
got the inspiration for this talk was

49
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,710
you know I think everyone should be

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,929
strategic about their career growth I

51
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,720
definitely have been and I thought maybe

52
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,150
I could write a

53
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:18,560
talk about being strategic about growing

54
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:21,290
your influence so what do I mean by

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,050
influence I think to me influences the

56
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,810
ability to change minds to generate

57
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,610
respect within your organization to be

58
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:32,090
able to have an impact on the people

59
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:34,580
around you and as you grow in your

60
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,140
career the expectations on your ability

61
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,700
to influence will increase so when

62
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,470
you're junior you know there's not a lot

63
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,780
of expectation that you can walk up to a

64
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,420
VP and impress them but as you get more

65
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,430
senior to staff or director level it's

66
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,079
basically a requirement you have to be

67
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,050
able to do it as you get more

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,000
responsibility you need more influence

69
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,290
so I like to think you know if you want

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,730
to grow your career you've got to grow

71
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,650
your influence how can you do this

72
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,600
strategically how can you show

73
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:01,310
improvement in your influence over time

74
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,420
and manage this while you're doing all

75
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,680
the other things that you're doing with

76
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:09,320
your career one thing I like to focus on

77
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,850
is feedback so feedback is often how

78
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,410
people measure whether you've got

79
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,690
influence or not when you're coming up

80
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:16,100
for promotion your boss may say hi and

81
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,380
it'll I need a list of names we're gonna

82
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,910
generate some feedback your organization

83
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,680
may have different rules like you know

84
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,079
mandatory feedback from a certain set of

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,800
people but it kind of takes this this

86
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,080
form here the other thing I hate as a

87
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,760
manager is when I get out of the blue

88
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,260
feedback about someone I haven't talked

89
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,149
to you in six months and suddenly I get

90
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,040
a request for feedback for you and I'm

91
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,739
like I don't really know this person

92
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,600
what I really like is someone who I have

93
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:43,700
a relationship a strong relationship

94
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,440
with when I get that feedback request

95
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,000
from them I write awesome feedback

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,150
because I know how important it is to

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,430
their career so I really tell my staff

98
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,769
you need to plan ahead for killer

99
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,420
feedback you know you just got promoted

100
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,920
you are gonna start working on your next

101
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,410
promotion let's say it's two plus years

102
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,030
away start thinking strategically now

103
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,450
how you're gonna build up that feedback

104
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,040
set you need to get to the next level

105
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,200
but something I hear pretty often is

106
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,179
that relationship building is tough

107
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,579
especially insecurity I think a lot of

108
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,230
us end up in a lot of conflict there's a

109
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,060
lot of escalations around what we do

110
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,709
we're trying to convince people to do

111
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,750
things that they don't often want to do

112
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,660
that cost them time cost them money and

113
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,580
so it can be difficult to build that

114
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,349
influence with stakeholders and

115
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,240
can also be difficult to build influence

116
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:31,400
within your organization you've got a

117
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,979
mandate it may be focused on a certain

118
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,659
set of stakeholders finding that common

119
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:36,859
ground with other security people in

120
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,120
your organization can be tough

121
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,379
especially if you're in a really big

122
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,460
organization and there's a lot of

123
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:46,009
siloing but that's where we come to the

124
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,068
crux of my talk here today

125
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:51,259
I think the strategies of asset

126
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:53,479
management can really help you work on

127
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:55,189
your influence strategically and grow

128
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,159
your career much more efficiently than

129
00:04:55,189 --> 00:05:00,440
you might otherwise so why do I think

130
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:02,599
that well you know when you're working

131
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,190
on your influence you generally have a

132
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:06,139
large number of people that you're

133
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,150
keeping track of you know you've got

134
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,440
your team you've got other stakeholders

135
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,919
you've got other departments within

136
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,449
security it's a lot of people and when

137
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:17,479
you're talking about a promotion there's

138
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:19,099
a long time period between you know one

139
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,568
role and the next role can be two years

140
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:22,699
it could be five years depending on

141
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:24,319
where you are in your career so you

142
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,539
really have to work on your influence

143
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,949
over a long period of time and like I

144
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,810
said you've got lots of priorities and

145
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,580
you're not just there to make friends

146
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,190
and get feedback you've got security

147
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,318
impact that you're driving so sometimes

148
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,509
getting feedback getting visibility is a

149
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,949
secondary thing you know you're focused

150
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:42,229
more on the impact of your work as you

151
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,669
should be but you have to keep in the

152
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:45,050
back of your mind that that impact is

153
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:48,770
going to be critical at the moment when

154
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:50,629
you need it so when I talk about asset

155
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,549
management I'm talking about people here

156
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:55,009
the people that you are influencing are

157
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,139
your assets and I think you can track

158
00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:00,560
them more efficiently so let's dig into

159
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:04,129
what I mean I believe very strongly that

160
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,719
you know at the outset of a new moment

161
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:07,699
in your career say you just got promoted

162
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:09,620
and you've got new responsibilities or

163
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:12,589
you've just started a new role you

164
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:15,889
really need to identify who your assets

165
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:19,400
are or possibly where you need assets

166
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:21,650
and don't have them so you know variety

167
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,539
is very key here you need people within

168
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,770
the security organization you need

169
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:27,139
people outside of the security

170
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,000
organization you need leaders within

171
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,349
your vertical depending on the size of

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,949
your security team you need leaders

173
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:35,690
outside of your vertical and you have to

174
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:37,990
build all of these relationships over

175
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,990
time

176
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,610
some of these can be really hard

177
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:43,169
depending on the role that you're in I

178
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,900
know for my team enterprise security

179
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,248
we're very business focused so building

180
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,438
business relationships is a piece of

181
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:51,479
cake before the people on my team it's

182
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,189
with insecurity where they're often not

183
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,139
overlapping roles that it can be really

184
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:57,330
hard so we really have to be proactive

185
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,080
with our security partners to try and

186
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,969
build that visibility within our team

187
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,159
also you know discs and very company the

188
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:07,050
company you know Salesforce has certain

189
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,759
requirements on the kinds of feedback

190
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,169
you need going into a promotion for

191
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,449
certain levels your company may have

192
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:13,498
different requirements so I think

193
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:15,210
identifying what those requirements are

194
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,999
upfront so they're not a surprise later

195
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,248
is really effective the other thing you

196
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:22,289
might notice is what if you have some

197
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:24,689
gaps here you don't know a manager

198
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:26,909
really well outside of your direct

199
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:28,949
manager in the security function well

200
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:31,998
then you know okay I have an area where

201
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:34,319
I need to go in and identify an asset

202
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:34,949
but once you've got that asset list what

203
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,279
do you do next

204
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:40,680
I recommend fingerprinting your assets I

205
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,939
think you need to know a lot more about

206
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,589
them and then you're probably tracking

207
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,300
day to day and there's some reasons to

208
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:47,009
this that I'll get to but I think it's

209
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,979
important to know what role they play to

210
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:52,439
you or they appear of yours or a leader

211
00:07:48,979 --> 00:07:54,930
and then rank varies company to company

212
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:58,409
I see that as like one being you know

213
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,999
CEO 10 being any level finding out where

214
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:02,479
they are and the hierarchy is important

215
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:05,550
because many companies have hierarchy

216
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,649
requirements for promotion so some

217
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,269
people may not be as effective in terms

218
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:11,610
of feedback for your promotion as others

219
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:13,459
are also knowing whether there's

220
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,139
security organization or not

221
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,939
prioritizing them based on your needs

222
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,979
you know where you are your career

223
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,259
currently and then I think it's really

224
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,209
important to be honest about the status

225
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,110
of your relationship with people ideally

226
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:28,229
you want to have a great relationship

227
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,789
with everyone but in a in a company in

228
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:32,149
an organization especially when you're

229
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:34,559
in security it's not really realistic

230
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:36,328
but I think it's important to identify

231
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,818
some people that you maybe don't have a

232
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:41,578
great relationship and target them and

233
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:43,380
really work overtime on approve

234
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:46,349
improving their opinion of you because I

235
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,019
know when you get into promotion

236
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,000
conversations as a manager it's really

237
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,550
powerful to hear someone say you know I

238
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,519
really

239
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,529
like this person at first but they kept

240
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,120
working on me they kept showing me how

241
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:00,700
good they were and I've turned around I

242
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,529
love this person now that means a ton in

243
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,959
a promotion conversation and goes a long

244
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:09,339
way you also want to track when you're

245
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:12,310
talking to them so how do you use this

246
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:14,019
info once you've got it then you want to

247
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,149
monitor your assets and this is a little

248
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:19,180
more manual than traditional asset

249
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:21,790
monitoring but I recommend blocking your

250
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,380
calendar I do mine thirty minutes every

251
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,480
four weeks but you could do it as often

252
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,279
it's two weeks depending on how often

253
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,810
you need to do this kind of thing but

254
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,550
you want to look at that spreadsheet of

255
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,349
people you've put out there and you want

256
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,120
to think about how is that spreadsheet

257
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,310
changed a lot of times people get

258
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,980
promoted people leave the company people

259
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:41,589
take on new responsibilities or you've

260
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,970
just had hallway conversations that when

261
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,130
you look at someone's name in that sheet

262
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,450
you go oh man I should talk to them

263
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,890
about what I just heard this could be

264
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,040
really interesting opportunity for both

265
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:52,720
of us and that's the next thing to do

266
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,250
once you've you know spent that time

267
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,899
looking at those people is identify

268
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,720
opportunities where you can collaborate

269
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,040
with those people either reaching out if

270
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,740
you haven't spoken to someone in a

271
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,420
couple months get coffee with them look

272
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,510
at gaps you may have in your coverage

273
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,699
organizations change very rapidly people

274
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:12,490
leave the company move on you may need

275
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,140
to go and find a new manager because the

276
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:17,800
one you had a really great relationship

277
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:20,290
just went somewhere else promotions are

278
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,240
also key too because when people get

279
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,339
additional opportunities it is a great

280
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,320
time to connect with them both in terms

281
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:27,880
of project opportunities just

282
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,360
understanding what their goals are and

283
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,579
you know as they get a bigger promotion

284
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,690
they are more interesting in terms of

285
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:40,000
feedback for your career as well so this

286
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,100
is how I do my asset management I've

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,320
been doing this for about six years I

288
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,920
have a Google spreadsheet that I spend

289
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,620
30 minutes with every month and I track

290
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,110
every one that I'm working on over time

291
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,079
and it has been super super effective to

292
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,399
me I really like this approach so I

293
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,709
thought I'd just share it with you here

294
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:03,679
I'm gonna pop over

295
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:05,179
here that look okay yeah I used random

296
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,709
Star Trek data here I didn't want to

297
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:08,959
show you actually the people I'm talking

298
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:12,638
to in my organization but theoretically

299
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,420
here I'm a security engineer under Worf

300
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,980
maybe I don't have a great relationship

301
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,269
with him because it's hard to have a

302
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,459
great relationship with Worf

303
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:21,110
but you know there's a lot of people

304
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:22,878
within the enterprise that I want to

305
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,769
influence in order to grow my career and

306
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,749
I can track that here so looking at this

307
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:28,670
spreadsheet now I might think well

308
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:30,649
Wesley Crusher is new to the bridge

309
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,509
maybe I should spend some time with him

310
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:34,220
he seems pretty smart so I might look at

311
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:35,809
this and then go into my calendar and

312
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,660
reach out and schedule a meeting with

313
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:40,790
him I also have a couple other tabs that

314
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,589
I use I've got an external one which I

315
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,519
didn't populate with with data because

316
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:45,529
sometimes you're trying to influence

317
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,910
people don't work at your company and I

318
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:48,170
also have an archive because a lot of

319
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,360
times people will leave your company

320
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,769
you'll scratch them off but there's

321
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,269
boomerangs it happens all the time

322
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,799
especially you know I've been at

323
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:56,779
Salesforce for nine years yeah Amar'e's

324
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,980
waving he's a boomerang they leave and

325
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,480
then they come back and then you should

326
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,949
just throw them right back into the

327
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:10,939
roster and get to know them again

328
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:12,979
because they will be your friend so

329
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,809
you've got this spreadsheet now you've

330
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,419
got people in it you're you're targeting

331
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:19,910
them for conversations for coffee for

332
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:21,559
opportunities I just thought it might be

333
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,850
useful to talk about a few tips that

334
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,819
have worked for me over the years

335
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,199
using this strategy to make the most of

336
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:29,118
the people that you're spending your

337
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:31,819
time with or that you're investing your

338
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:37,249
energy to befriend and turn into an

339
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:40,639
asset so I think collaboration is really

340
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:42,529
really really important even when it

341
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,529
might be faster for you to do something

342
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:49,160
on your own by yourself and I'll tell

343
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:50,869
you a bit why collaboration tends to

344
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,089
create opportunities even where you

345
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:55,009
wouldn't expect it so let's say there's

346
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,899
a project you know a scripting project

347
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:58,759
you can knock it out on your own but if

348
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:00,649
you invite someone in to participate

349
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,419
with you you might teach them something

350
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:04,189
that could be really useful to them they

351
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:06,379
might have ideas about that project that

352
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:07,849
you didn't even think of but oftentimes

353
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:09,289
though they think is most exciting as

354
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,019
you knock out a small project with

355
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,470
someone and then the ideas that come for

356
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,290
follow-ups

357
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,670
projects that you didn't even expect

358
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:20,079
what at the outset where you wouldn't

359
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,449
even got there if you didn't partner

360
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,370
with someone the other thing that I

361
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,810
think is important here is the chance to

362
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,220
expand your impact you know when you

363
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,449
bring someone else in they've got a

364
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,670
different perspective they may have a

365
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,980
totally different job if they can apply

366
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,510
what you're thinking you know if you

367
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,490
have some automation in mind and they

368
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,770
can expand what that automation can do

369
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,780
to their department as well you are not

370
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,430
only influencing that person in that

371
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,959
organization but you're a driving

372
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,969
additional security impact which is

373
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,030
super important and you might learn new

374
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,860
things from these people so once you're

375
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,680
collaborating this is a very very

376
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,300
important step at least to me you and

377
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
this person let's say me and Emmerich is

378
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,420
he's sitting right here in front of me

379
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,550
me and Emery are collaborating together

380
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,740
and we've got great visibility between

381
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,479
each other you know we both know exactly

382
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,640
what we're doing but that isn't always

383
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,650
useful when it comes to promotion time I

384
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,240
can get feedback from him but what I

385
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,939
really want is feedback from his boss

386
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,950
and he may want feedback from my boss so

387
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,470
this is something I like to tell the

388
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,600
people who work on my team your boss and

389
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,400
your boss is time or a currency that you

390
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,080
can spend you know someone on my team

391
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,329
can come to me and say hey I need your

392
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,760
attention on this thing so I recommend

393
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,980
leveraging your boss as currency in

394
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,160
trade for access to someone else's boss

395
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,540
you can say let's send a status email

396
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,430
talking about the work we're doing

397
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,959
together to your boss in my boss and

398
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,030
let's make sure that we each get the

399
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,010
visibility we need someone up the chain

400
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,860
so that when it comes time to promotion

401
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:46,270
I have access to feedback from someone

402
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:53,710
at a much higher level than if I just

403
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:57,430
stuck with with them right here all

404
00:14:53,710 --> 00:15:01,120
right one more silly trick that I think

405
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:02,949
is useful email filters are a great way

406
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,690
to prioritize the people that you're

407
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,870
tracking you know there's a lot of noise

408
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,390
we all get a ton of email we may not

409
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,400
always keep up on it but with a you know

410
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:14,620
15 minutes of work you can add everyone

411
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,140
you're tracking to an email filter that

412
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,880
pops them into a special gmail box where

413
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,280
you see it immediately at the top of

414
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,140
everything else this can greatly improve

415
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,939
how you respond to these people how you

416
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,600
manage these relationships over time

417
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,250
make you seem really

418
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,350
be consistent to them which is important

419
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,120
you know everyone's a priority when

420
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,829
you're in security but when you're

421
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,420
working on your career you also have to

422
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:37,008
really prioritize the people who are

423
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:46,160
going to talk to your boss about how

424
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:49,160
effective you are so in conclusion I

425
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,079
think it's really important to approach

426
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,149
building your influence strategically

427
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:55,008
and you can do it like I'm doing it you

428
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,660
can throw people in a spreadsheet you

429
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:59,029
can treat it like asset management and

430
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,310
you can be consistent with these people

431
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:01,819
over time by monitoring what they're

432
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,500
doing

433
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:05,060
watching the changes in your

434
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,360
organization looking for new

435
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:11,508
opportunities and taking advantage of

436
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,639
those to build your career finally I

437
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:16,160
think everyone needs to collaborate more

438
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,110
often I say this the most in one-on-ones

439
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,759
find people to collaborate with outside

440
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,529
your organization because it will really

441
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,529
drive your career forward more than you

442
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:26,329
think and you will get great value out

443
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:27,350
of that influence that you have not just

444
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:33,439
in your department but in other

445
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:38,180
departments as well and that's it thank

446
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:39,980
you very much and if you want me to work

447
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,609
on your career I'm also hiring so you

448
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,050
can come and I'd be happy to help

449
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,310
and I'm happy to answer questions too

450
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,508
and I put this in here because I wanted

451
00:16:46,310 --> 00:17:24,168
to see how it looks really big that's

452
00:16:47,509 --> 00:17:26,390
cool yeah yeah so I actually think

453
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:28,730
that's we're adding some structure like

454
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,980
this can really help you because it's a

455
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,299
reminder to challenge yourself you know

456
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,710
if you're looking at your sheet and

457
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,600
you're being like oh gosh I've never

458
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,730
talked to this person that I really want

459
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,730
to just put together a quick email that

460
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,320
says hey I

461
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,640
you know I really value what you're

462
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,350
doing with your career I think it's

463
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,150
really interesting would you have time

464
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,799
to get coffee with me that goes a long

465
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,750
way you know and if you're just

466
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,040
reminding yourself constantly you're

467
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,690
gonna push yourself a little more than

468
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,540
you might otherwise if you can put that

469
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:57,530
you know that need way off to the side

470
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:01,168
and not pay attention to it

471
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:04,168
question from slide oh yeah anonymous is

472
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:06,150
wondering would you say asset management

473
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:08,610
in quotes is difficult for

474
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,400
underrepresented minorities including

475
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,330
people of color and women do you have

476
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,330
any specific advice

477
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,750
obviously I'm a white man so I don't

478
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,370
have a ton of perspective on that

479
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,260
question but I do think it can be

480
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,928
challenging especially in an

481
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:27,629
organization that doesn't have a lot of

482
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,520
underrepresented people I think you know

483
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,160
finding you know that could be another

484
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,990
lens you put in your asset management

485
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,419
it's who are some people that inspire me

486
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,250
within this organization that I can

487
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,900
reach out to and spend time with and

488
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,100
maybe will give me career advice and

489
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,929
opportunities that I didn't have

490
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:51,629
otherwise I think that would be a great

491
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:57,120
thing to do sure over here yeah yeah

492
00:18:51,630 --> 00:19:01,580
just ask I yes I believe the slides will

493
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,659
be posted and I put in a URL link to the

494
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,389
spreadsheet as well so you can just grab

495
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,120
it I'll put it on my Twitter that'll be

496
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:12,540
that I'll do that in like ten minutes

497
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,129
another question from Jeannie so you're

498
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,780
having coffee with one of your assets

499
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,000
what's your goal in that conversation

500
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:21,360
trying to get them to advocate down the

501
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,230
road for pure promotion questions so I

502
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,790
think that's a really good question

503
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:28,710
because you don't want to be super

504
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:30,450
mercenary about this going back to the

505
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,450
head of my privacy team is somebody that

506
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,250
I've known for six years and she's in my

507
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,429
asset deck and I hope she doesn't watch

508
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,140
this as I talk about her but I have

509
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:42,299
frequently kept in touch with her over

510
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:44,220
the years just asking what are your

511
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,679
priorities what are you working on right

512
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,780
now what is scaring you in the in the

513
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,030
company because I can get a lot of

514
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,440
interesting ideas just by spending time

515
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,658
with

516
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,120
like that and if I see a problem that I

517
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:58,009
can solve on her behalf I'm absolutely

518
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,080
gonna jump in there and do it because

519
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:02,000
that is a great opportunity to both make

520
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,309
an impact at the company but also help

521
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,019
someone I really like and build up

522
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:09,220
reputation and influence with someone

523
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:09,220
who can help me in my career as well

524
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:36,649
yeah totally so how do I make time for

525
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,960
it

526
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:40,699
Oh repeat the question so well the first

527
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,750
question was how do you make time for

528
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:46,159
something like this when you're really

529
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:49,009
busy I think or when the other person is

530
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,730
really busy that's even harder so going

531
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:54,169
back to this slide I think this is a

532
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,450
really important strategy in those

533
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,820
scenarios you can start by targeting

534
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:03,200
someone who isn't as busy and work your

535
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:05,240
way up the chain so if I know that I

536
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,500
want to target someone's boss is someone

537
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,269
that I think could be really important

538
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,759
spending time with one of their direct

539
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:13,490
reports is a great way to make yourself

540
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,870
valuable and I pay attention like a lot

541
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,460
of attention to the people who are

542
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,379
partnering with the people who are on my

543
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,179
direct team because I really like that

544
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:22,250
they're seeking out collaboration

545
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:24,080
finding ways to help my team have a

546
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,179
greater impact I think that's really

547
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,480
really important and that's what makes

548
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:30,679
me prioritize someone like that did that

549
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:37,700
answer kind of both your questions at

550
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:41,210
the same time I'm happy to talk after

551
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:45,259
two we have one more question from slide

552
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:48,590
Oh from an ominous the wood units would

553
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:50,029
you not seem oh sorry would you not seem

554
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,189
that focused or less professional

555
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:54,860
scheduling so many meetings in coffees

556
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,870
as a technical engineer who's not in

557
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,100
your minute as a technical engineer was

558
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,189
not in management

559
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,840
that's a great question so I didn't jump

560
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,610
into a lot unlike what is the time frame

561
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,709
for this you know I've been at

562
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:09,049
Salesforce over nine years so I stand to

563
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,909
tend to think in really long ranges I

564
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:12,440
don't expect you to be scheduling a

565
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:13,519
coffee with every single person every

566
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,539
week that's absurd

567
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,610
they're not gonna have the time you

568
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:19,070
don't have the time I tend to think like

569
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:21,019
once a quarter for some people once a

570
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,820
month for others it depends on how often

571
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:24,049
you're spending time with like if you're

572
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,908
working with them on a project great

573
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:26,840
meet with them a lot if it's someone

574
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:28,129
like an exec

575
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,500
over a function that you're partnering

576
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:33,500
with once a quarter maybe once every six

577
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,960
months but having some kind of touch

578
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,369
point at some point well before you're

579
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:57,619
going up for promotion is super

580
00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:59,869
important nice yes to all of it and

581
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:01,699
sometimes different priorities for

582
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:03,529
different people so like when I'm

583
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,480
meeting with when I'm meeting with Mr a

584
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:07,279
right here he's in the product security

585
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,139
organization and I'm in the enterprise

586
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:10,730
security organization I'm trying to meet

587
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:12,709
with him to talk about what are areas

588
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,909
where our teams have overlapped where we

589
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,159
could potentially have a project

590
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:17,539
together that would be awesome I'm not

591
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,980
trying to get him to like me I'm just

592
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:20,899
trying to do stuff with him that will be

593
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,539
effective for our organization yeah I

594
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:25,908
know you don't like me but there are

595
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:29,090
some people where you know maybe I know

596
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:31,309
that someone has been sniping at me by

597
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,379
email or you know talking about me

598
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:35,869
behind my back I might reach out to that

599
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:37,939
person just to be very very blunt and

600
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:40,279
say you know I don't think we got off on

601
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,409
the right foot water you know what we do

602
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:45,519
to improve our relationship and I think

603
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:45,519
that's perfectly valid to do

604
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,019
[Music]

605
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:07,770
Chris you're in my spreadsheet yes yes

606
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,750
it is important I think to have a few

607
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,000
contacts outside of your company you

608
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,590
know you may want a job at some point in

609
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,540
the future somewhere else and so maybe

610
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,770
you maintain some relationships with

611
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,020
some people that you think might help

612
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,790
you in that arena or you might want to

613
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,290
speak with someone tomorrow about vendor

614
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,680
security and so you might have them in

615
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:47,430
there

616
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:48,900
reach out to them on occasion yeah fair

617
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:51,420
question so the question was how did I

618
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,680
fail from zoology into security which I

619
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,780
think is a really interesting story

620
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,890
that's longer than this then longer than

621
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,700
the amount of time I have but I would

622
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:02,160
say I hated zoology a lot I thought it

623
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,640
just was too manual for me at the time I

624
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,500
really liked computers a lot more and my

625
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,940
interest in security has always been

626
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,050
about just breaking things and so I I'd

627
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:18,390
love to talk to you afterwards I'll tell

628
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:20,250
you the whole story cool anything else

629
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,150
all good all right thank you

630
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,949
thank you thank you so much girl

631
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,949
[Applause]
