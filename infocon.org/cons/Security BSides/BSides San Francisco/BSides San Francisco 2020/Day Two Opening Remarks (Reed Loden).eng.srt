40
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:49,179
knowledge you know keep the conversation

41
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:51,520

50
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:11,170
hall and other things the Career Center

51
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:15,790
we want people to be able to participate

52
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:17,260
again three different floors I'm sure

53
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,920
most of you are familiar with that now

54
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,810
mezzanine for registration this is the

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,518
city view level where most of the stuff

56
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:30,519
is the and then AMC on the third floor

57
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,319
is where we have the IMAX track and then

58
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:38,040
theater 14 and 15 plus some overflow

59
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:41,290

71
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,099
intense conversations happening and so

84
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,199
printed program in your bags we have a

85
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:49,180
couple of different TVs around the venue

86
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,420
and then it's also in hacker tracker as

87
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,580
well if you have that from

88
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,200
countenance with their events just a

89
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,480
reminder that the outdoor patio is

90
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,220
non-smoking only if you need to smoke

91
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,959
and that includes vaping you need to go

92
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,810
all the way down to the ground level for

93
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:07,280
that again Q&A is done via slide oh

94
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,020
there's a bunch of signs around that

95
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,270
have a QR code you can scan but if you

96
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:14,390
just go to to slider calm and inner be

97
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:16,970
size SF 2020 you can then pick the track

98
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:21,168
that you're in and ask your questions

99
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:22,669
that way and then we need feedback we

100
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:24,409
need to know if this is working for you

101
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:26,690
if there's anything we can do to improve

102
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,870
if we're actually creating this

103
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:31,580
atmosphere for conversation so please

104
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,889
give us feedback you can go to be says

105
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,630
SF dot org slash feedback you can also

106
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,570
if you have feedback about a particular

107
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,880
session you can just go onto sched and

108
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:46,070
there's a button on the schedule to

109
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,419
provide feedback so we take you know

110
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,040
creating a safe environment very

111
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:51,320
seriously and so we have a code of

112
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,150
conduct we've had this go to conduct now

113
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,370
for a number of years we've signs posted

114
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,799
around the venue it basically boils down

115
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,110
to show respect and tolerance for each

116
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,539
other's uniqueness be kind and practice

117
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,580
the golden rule in short what that means

118
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:06,409
is do not be an ass I will kick your ass

119
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,990
out

120
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,720
so again absolutely zero tolerance for

121
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,770
Maude for any physical verbal or sexual

122
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,220
harassment intimidation or

123
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,200
marginalization of any human if you

124
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,820
encounter this you can find any of our

125
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,010
staff members or any of our public

126
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,969
safety in the orange shirts let them

127
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:28,159
know and we will take care of it for the

128
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,930
full code of conduct again check the

129
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,090
signs and also check your code your

130
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:38,419
program so hygiene again this is a lot a

131
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:42,859
lot of people's minds with the corner

132
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:45,260
virus and threat and so we understand

133
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,240
that like hey you know some people may

134
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,070
not want to shake hands or some people

135
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,690
may not want to hug and so you just keep

136
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,120
that in mind try like a fist bump or

137
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,910
something you know just just wave or

138
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,310
something but just keep that in mind we

139
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,440
have hand sanitizer in your registration

140
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,770
bags we also have it throughout the

141
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,469
venue including the bathrooms

142
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,570
just you know we're also wiping down all

143
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,420
the major services cleaning the mics in

144
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,580
between uses and just you know practice

145
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,110
basic courtesy call from your elbows and

146
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,659
just make sure we're doing our best to

147
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,880
not spread germs and wash your hands

148
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,930
please thank you

149
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,969
so this conference is we have kind of

150
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,170
unique video and photo policy that not a

151
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,570
lot of our others kind of security

152
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:33,020
conferences and such have it basically

153
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:36,290
boils down to that if you're going to

154
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:38,599
take a photo or video make sure that you

155
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,570

156
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,510
frame may everybody the shot crowd shots

157
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,790
are you know discouraged because of this

158
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,830
there is one exception this policy and

159
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,080
it's written in but we actually have an

160
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,550
official photographer this year for the

161
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,440
first time ever hoping to actually

162
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,190
capture the event we've never actually

163
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,420
had photos of the event before and so

164
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,450
she's walking around with the vinner

165
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:05,660
badge and see if I see her there she is

166
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:08,240

196
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,009
charity that gives back to the local San

197
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,619
Francisco community and so

198
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:21,529
many different ways so when you buy a

199
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:23,270
t-shirt over near coat-check there are

200
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:25,219
boxes there you'll get a token and you

201
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,359

204
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:36,198
closing ceremonies and finally but last

205
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,110
not least this events not possible

206
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:41,828
without all of our sponsors this is say

207
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,269
you know we're in downtown San Francisco

208
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:46,670
San Francisco in general is just super

209
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:48,829
expensive putting this event on is very

210
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,479
expensive we actually cost more to put

211
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:52,699
on this event than B says Las Vegas

212
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,490
which is bigger than us but that's just

213
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:58,040
the nature of being in one of the most

214
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,510
expensive cities in the world it's not

215
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,279
possible without our very generous

216
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,720
sponsors so each one of these

217
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,720
organizations has contributed something

218
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,370
to make this event possible and special

219
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,639
