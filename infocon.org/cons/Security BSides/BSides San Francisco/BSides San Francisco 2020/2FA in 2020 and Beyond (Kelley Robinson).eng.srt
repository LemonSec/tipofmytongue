1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,780
today we have a really great talk on

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,029
two-factor authentication by Kelly

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,949
Robinson she works in the account

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,080
security team at Twilio helping

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,150
developers manage and secure customer

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,370
identity in their software applications

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,650
please give her your respect and

8
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,880
attention throughout her whole talk

9
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,590
awesome thank you thank you all for

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,019
joining apparently there was a mild

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,759
projector issue earlier so we're here

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,788
now I'm gonna go a little bit over my

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,000
time a little bit after three just so

14
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,380
you know what to expect so I've been

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
thinking about this a lot in this last

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,040
week this was something that the

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,920
security researcher Troy hunt tweeted

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,899
last week for those of you that might

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,879
not be familiar with Troy he is the

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,690
researcher behind the website have I

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,890
been on comm who here uses that website

22
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,539
for those of you that did not raise your

23
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,000
hand definitely recommend checking this

24
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,649
out later it's a service that compiles

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,660
data breach information and lets you

26
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,960
know if your email address or password

27
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,370
has been seen in a data breach but I

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,729
think this is a really interesting take

29
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,860
because in 2020 the reality is we're so

30
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,110
owned right now that we expect

31
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,390
legitimate email addresses to have been

32
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,710
seen in a data breach right we expect

33
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,900
that you would have gotten owned at some

34
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,030
point I know I certainly have I'm

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,159
guessing if you're not lying most of you

36
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,670
also have as well and that's not your

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,880
fault

38
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,570
right like it's a scary world out there

39
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,000
and while this isn't a talked about data

40
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:32,039
storage security you know there's still

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,680
a lot of unsecure password usage out

42
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,150
there and Troy hunts project proves that

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,939
as much as we'd like to believe

44
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,430
otherwise simple passwords like one two

45
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,610
three four five six are still being used

46
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,450
a lot that password has been seen over

47
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,149
23 million times in data breaches and

48
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:53,040
it's still incredibly common so this is

49
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,750
what we're here to discuss today this

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,149
reality where we're so owns that

51
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,549
passwords are no longer enough how

52
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,740
two-factor authentication or 2fa can

53
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,360
help us stay more secure and help keep

54
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,119
our companies and our customers more

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,810
secure and how we can evaluate all the

56
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,690
different options available for 2fa so

57
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,640
my name is Kelly Robinson

58
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,910
work at Twilio if you haven't come say

59
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,529
hi at our booth please do after this if

60
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,900
you are familiar with off the air all

61
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,480
the users toward the 2fa app Tulio

62
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,430
acquired authy five years ago and I work

63
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,230
on the part of the business that

64
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,930
includes offi our account security team

65
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,700
so I work on our API square things like

66
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,830
phone and e-mail verification and

67
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,260
two-factor authentication and I also

68
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,720
spend a good amount of my time educating

69
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,120
developers about security and especially

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,250
identity and authentication concepts and

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,690
so this talk is going to incorporate a

72
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,370
lot of the things I have learned in the

73
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,680
last two-and-a-half years working there

74
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,100
and working with our customers on their

75
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,010
authentication challenges in the failure

76
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,989
of good authentication often results in

77
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,420
account takeover and according to

78
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,700
javelin study and research from 2019

79
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,010
this is a four billion dollar industry

80
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,079
problem and so this is why people are

81
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,340
incentivized by the industries and sent

82
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,500
advice to solve this because this is

83
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,750
costing businesses a lot of money it's

84
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,490
costing people a lot of pain to have

85
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,930
their account being broken into so

86
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,410
there's a lot of incentives to fix this

87
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:19,760
problem and one of the ways that we have

88
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,500
classically authenticated people into

89
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,290
our systems is with these different

90
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,420
types of factors primarily we're using

91
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,179
knowledge factor to prove your identity

92
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,609
and so this is the authentication factor

93
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,250
that is something that you know like a

94
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,600
password but in order to keep us more

95
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,060
secure we want to start adding

96
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,010
additional factors anything that uses

97
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,110
two or more of these different factors

98
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,660
is what's known as two-factor

99
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,519
authentication and so you in addition to

100
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,109
the knowledge factor also have the

101
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,150
possession factor which is something you

102
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,760
have like a mobile phone or a security

103
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,769
key and the inherence factor which is

104
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,769
like biometric data like face ID

105
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,670
because we're focusing on the second

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,798
factor all the things that we're going

107
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,780
to talk about today have to do with this

108
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,859
possession factor and that's just

109
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,760
because these are some of the most

110
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:11,370
common types of 2fa available right now

111
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,420
that we're going to be focusing on this

112
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,159
so let's talk about the different

113
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,630
factors that we have available and talk

114
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:19,358
about some of the benefits and downsides

115
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,190
to these different factors starting with

116
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,888
everyone's favorite sms-based

117
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:26,370
one-time passwords and so one of the

118
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:29,259
reasons that people like this factor is

119
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,949
because it's easy to onboard your

120
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,830
customers

121
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:34,840
according to a recent Pew study 99

122
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,270
percent of Americans have a mobile phone

123
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,729
capable of receiving text messages and

124
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,799
that's huge this makes companies want to

125
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,960
add this channel because it's really

126
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,580
easy to onboard your users you don't

127
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,219
have to make them do anything special

128
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,109
they already are capable and familiar

129
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,210
with receiving these one-time codes via

130
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,550
SMS this is a factor that's been around

131
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,770
for over a decade and it's become so

132
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,020
popular that people are familiar with

133
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,830
this factor and are willing to use it

134
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:05,650
however this is not a secure delivery

135
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,000
mechanism for one-time pass codes it's

136
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,669
subject to man-in-the-middle attacks

137
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,039
people can get access to the codes that

138
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:14,530
are being sent to you because SMS is not

139
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:16,300
an encrypted Channel and there are ways

140
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,698
that people can get access to those

141
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,880
messages one way that they can do that

142
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:25,360
is through ss7 vulnerabilities ss7 is

143
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,889
the signaling system 7 and to condense

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,320
an explanation of the vulnerability

145
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:32,050
there it basically is a vulnerability in

146
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,509
the inter carrier telecom switching that

147
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,090
allows people to impersonate a carrier

148
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:39,940
in order to get your messages routed to

149
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,380
them and so if I'm roaming a carrier in

150
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,820
another country or a someone

151
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,340
impersonating a carrier in another

152
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,320
country can say hey Kelly's actually in

153
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,900
Colombia right now why don't you send

154
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,680
our messages to us and that allows them

155
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,150
to get access to my text messages but

156
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,860
arguably the more common thing that

157
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,109
we're seeing right now is what's known

158
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,300
as sim swapping and this is when people

159
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,380
use social engineering or perhaps

160
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,870
bribery of telecom agents

161
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,790
to get access to my SIM cards so if you

162
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,190
want to call up Verizon and tell them

163
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,860
hey I'm Kelly and I would like you to

164
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,719
send a new SIM card to this address or

165
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,480
you go into a store and bribe an agent

166
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,030
or successfully impersonate me in person

167
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,500
then you can get access to my text

168
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,239
messages that way and all of a sudden

169
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,530
I'm cut off from everything that's being

170
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,330
sent to my number so SMS is a super

171
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,890
convenient option but it's not very

172
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,719
secure another method that we have

173
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,120
available is what's known as soft tokens

174
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,290
or TOTP which stands for time-based

175
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,180
one-time pass codes these are a way to

176
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,550
generate tokens based on an algorithm

177
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,040
the inputs to that algorithm are a

178
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,740
secret key a shared symmetric secret key

179
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,720
and the system time and those get put

180
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,510
through a one-way function that pops out

181
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,850
a truncated token symmetric key

182
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,190
cryptography offers increased security

183
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,740
compared to SMS but if someone gets

184
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,900
access to that shared secret then the

185
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,750
method is easily compromised at a

186
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,950
previous job we had two FA turned on for

187
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,980
some of these shared engineering

188
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:16,020
accounts but we shared the QR code in

189
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,640
the engineering slack channels so that

190
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,770
when new people join the team they could

191
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,890
scan that and get a totp on their phone

192
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,750
this is not a horrible situation but

193
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,000
this is an example of how this type of

194
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,040
factor could get compromised because

195
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,740
it's not device specific it's not person

196
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,410
specific and so there is the ability for

197
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,970
these types of secrets to be leaked but

198
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,920
it offers some distinct advantages

199
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,190
because it's an algorithm that basically

200
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,270
uses simple math and the inputs are not

201
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,880
do not require an internet connection

202
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,770
this is available offline and it's also

203
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,290
an open standard so while this does

204
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,909
require you to download an app there's

205
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,310
multiple apps that have implemented this

206
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,930
standard so anywhere that you see Google

207
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,670
Authenticator like scan it with Google

208
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,170
Authenticator you can scan that with you

209
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,210
oh you can scan that with aathi you can

210
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:03,090
scan that with the totp app of your

211
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,580
choice unfortunately this does require

212
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:09,119
the app download and in a recent study

213
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,210
of token usability they found that

214
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,490
two-thirds of participants who had

215
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,799
issues who use TOTP had issues entering

216
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,270
touken before it expired and so there

217
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,680
might be some concerns about the

218
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:24,729
usability there because of the

219
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,400
expiration user experience so this is a

220
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:28,840
pretty good option but it's not perfect

221
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,620
but we see a lot of security conscious

222
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,419
companies moving and adding to UTP as an

223
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,229
option in order to delight their more

224
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,640
security conscious users another thing

225
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:41,770
that I want to mention because this is

226
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,270
used in a study that I'm going to

227
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,640
reference later is the idea of

228
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,529
pre-generated codes and so this is

229
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,500
something that a website would generate

230
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:53,380
a set of usually backup tokens for you

231
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,810
and you would store those somewhere up

232
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,529
to you and then you can use those in

233
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,750
replacement of your 2f8 methods so this

234
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:04,450
is easy to use however if anybody has

235
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,910
ever implemented backup tokens or worked

236
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,500
at a company that had backup tokens you

237
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,839
know that your users never store these

238
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,370
you know they don't remember where they

239
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,410
stored them or if they email them to you

240
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,850
themselves or if they ever noticed that

241
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:19,540
this was an option that they could store

242
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,279
the backup tokens to begin with so this

243
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,949
is a challenging thing because there

244
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,790
isn't a standard way to give users to

245
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:29,890
store the backup tokens and 25% of users

246
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,719
in the study that I mentioned said that

247
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,819
when they use the backup token it didn't

248
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,480
really feel like added security on top

249
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,940
of just a password so this is an option

250
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,339
for backups we'll debate later if it's a

251
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:45,970
good option for backups but it's less

252
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:48,300
practical for ongoing use push

253
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,170
authentication is another channel for

254
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,899
two-factor authentication that we're

255
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:55,089
seeing more popularized in recent years

256
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,250
because of duo Authenticator and so

257
00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:00,040
users like this because it's so low

258
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,870
friction you can approve or deny a login

259
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,870
request from your Apple watcher from

260
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,390
your phone and it also uses a symmetric

261
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,490
key cryptography which uses two tokens

262
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,140
one of which the private key is only

263
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,779
stored on your device so it's device

264
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,939
specific it's user specific it doesn't

265
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,850
have the same shared secret leaking

266
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,920
potential that totp has you don't have

267
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,650
to worry about that secret leaking like

268
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,680
you might with totp and this is the only

269
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,760
form of 2fa that really offers a denial

270
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,069
feedback

271
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,870
eight so the other ones if you don't

272
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,340
recognize that message there's nothing

273
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,650
that you can do about the fact that

274
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,200
you're getting this request for two - fi

275
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,750
login however we've pushed

276
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,850
authentication you can build in actions

277
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,200
based on denial based on the fact that

278
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,200
you might think somebody's trying to

279
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,000
compromise an account unfortunately this

280
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,710
is so low friction that one of the

281
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,640
common arguments against push

282
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:56,650
authentication is that people see it as

283
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,020
too easy to accidentally approve a

284
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,390
request so in the middle of the night if

285
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,650
somebody is trying to fish you you might

286
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,720
accidentally approve that request

287
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:07,090
without meaning to just to make your

288
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,740
phone stop buzzing I haven't found any

289
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,720
research about how common that actually

290
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,400
is but that is something that people

291
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,800
note as a concern with push

292
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,540
authentication but one of the notable

293
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,209
downsides to push is that it does

294
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,640
require a special proprietary app that

295
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,620
could be built into your application and

296
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,960
if you are a mobile first company or a

297
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,760
company with a lot of mobile users we've

298
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,590
seen Google start to do this with any of

299
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,080
the google apps they use it as they push

300
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:34,510
Authenticator to approve login requests

301
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,880
from other devices but you might also

302
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,890
use something like duo or like coffee in

303
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,660
order to approve those requests and this

304
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,640
does require that somebody have an

305
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,770
application of any kind on their phone

306
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,400
and users aren't always willing to

307
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:50,410
download another app so it seems great

308
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,209
it's cryptographically secure but it

309
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,920
might be too convenient and there is the

310
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,170
downside of getting people to download

311
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,849
the additional application this also

312
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,280
will require some additional dev work

313
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:05,940
that might be slightly more complicated

314
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:08,230
than the adding of 2fa via SMS or TOTP

315
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,420
finally I want to talk about u2f

316
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,340
Universal second factors and web often

317
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,209
web off then is part of the new Fido -

318
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:18,640
spec that is including a path towards a

319
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,410
password list future we're not talking

320
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,850
about these as a password replacement

321
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,980
right now we're talking about these as

322
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,500
password augmentation as the second

323
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,180
factor - and so I combined these to

324
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,820
basically talk about things like

325
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,099
security keys like the tightened keys

326
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,720
that Google's giving away and these are

327
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,430
great because they're fishing resistant

328
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,590
you don't have the ability to get those

329
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,750
man-in-the-middle attacks it uses a

330
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,860
symmetric key cryptography so it's tied

331
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,260
both to these

332
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,959
specific and to the device that you are

333
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,630
using and authenticating from but it's

334
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,069
also an open standard like totp which

335
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,079
means that a lot of people can go and

336
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,820
implement the spec and add an

337
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:57,760
Authenticator that is compatible with

338
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,769
web off then the biggest drawbacks right

339
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,720
now is that this is kind of a new thing

340
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:03,970
not everybody has implemented web

341
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,560
offense aport yet though it's becoming I

342
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,200
think pretty standard across most major

343
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,329
browsers however one of the biggest

344
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,660
implementations right of this right now

345
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:15,550
are things like you bikies and like

346
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,860
google tighten keys and it's not super

347
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,930
reasonable for to expect that everyone

348
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,700
will have access to one of those unless

349
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,920
you are at peace sides and getting a

350
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,480
free one from google these things cost

351
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,640
about 50 bucks you have to actually

352
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,980
order one and so these are things that

353
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,600
you might want to consider if you're

354
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,550
thinking about getting these for

355
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,779
supporting this for especially things

356
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:39,250
like a consumer use case as more devices

357
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:41,920
that we already have like our phones

358
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,510
become supported authenticators and

359
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,140
there's a lot of phones like I think the

360
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:49,300
iOS or iPhones just added support for

361
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,310
this in like the last three months but

362
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,410
it's not as common right now and as

363
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,779
devices that we already have start to

364
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,329
adopt the standard we'll see this become

365
00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:00,339
more common and we'll also see this

366
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:01,779
become more common in places like in

367
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,510
ancient companies and enterprise

368
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,970
environments where you have used this

369
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,410
for employee authentication because you

370
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,240
have something like an IT department

371
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,279
that can hand you a physical token

372
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,110
during your onboarding and you have an

373
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,180
IT department that can handle the

374
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,800
account recovery use case because they

375
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,810
have details about who you are in the

376
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,870
employment system one of the drawbacks

377
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:25,300
of using Hardware security keys like

378
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,980
this is that when you lose one you might

379
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,079
have a really hard time getting back

380
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,390
into your account depending on how the

381
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:35,079
site has set it up to do the account

382
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:36,730
recovery so what I wanted to do was back

383
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,370
up some of this more qualitative data

384
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:41,529
with actual research and there was this

385
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,750
great study from 2019 that was presented

386
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:45,760
at the symposium unusable privacy and

387
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,800
security Supes great name for a

388
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,160
conference so this was presented last

389
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:53,319
August and study focused on setting up

390
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,469
and using these five factors that I just

391
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:55,550
walked through

392
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,320
this is definitely a really interesting

393
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,479
study I've linked this in the reefs and

394
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,770
the references for this talk I'll post

395
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,600
the slides after if you want to read

396
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,970
through the entire study there's also a

397
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,750
talk that they gave at Supes where they

398
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,640
kind of summarize their research on this

399
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,880
let's talk about how to set up these

400
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,189
different authentication tokens kind of

401
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,770
surprisingly the pre generated codes

402
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,480
were what they found were the fastest to

403
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,340
set up and that's because they did this

404
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,440
for google and google has a one-click

405
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,480
button that says generate some codes for

406
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,370
me unfortunately the study didn't really

407
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,770
take into account how the users would

408
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,780
store these tokens long-term and that

409
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,510
wasn't part of the overall setup and

410
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:38,630
usability considerations for measuring

411
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,520
the usage of these tokens so code

412
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,890
storage was not considered and like I

413
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,460
mentioned before 25% of the participants

414
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,650
in the study

415
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:50,120
so these pre generated codes didn't

416
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:53,750
really feel like any added security in a

417
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,240
different study from 2018 focus just on

418
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,950
you bikies but for cross-platform setup

419
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,650
I think this was really interesting

420
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,900
because the set up success was really

421
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,480
different depending on the platform so

422
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:09,260
Google had 83 percent success while

423
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,450
Facebook had 32 percent success and 2018

424
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:14,150
is like forever ago in terms of yuba

425
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:16,100
keys and hardware security tokens a lot

426
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,160
has changed since then but I think this

427
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,630
is a really interesting look at how

428
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,150
onboarding users can affect their

429
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:25,760
success in using a single type of

430
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,350
Authenticator so one of the things that

431
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,640
was really great about the Google set up

432
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,350
was that they walked you through it

433
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,150
step-by-step and made sure that users

434
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,410
had success at every step along the way

435
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,840
and that's why there was much more

436
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,280
success there the documentation for

437
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,470
setting it up with Facebook was more

438
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,150
lacking and so people were relying on a

439
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,690
combination of documentation from the

440
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,949
Yubikey website and from Facebook itself

441
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,230
so this is a really interesting look at

442
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:51,110
how onboarding UX of impacts user

443
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,790
success because you want to keep in mind

444
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,800
that you have to have successful logins

445
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,930
with these extra factors before you

446
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,880
allow people to actually turn it on and

447
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,130
so people were adding up locking

448
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,110
themselves out of Windows 10 computers

449
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,920
because the Windows 10 computers didn't

450
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,630
actually force them to use and

451
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,850
to complete a successful authentication

452
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:15,280
before they enabled the second factor so

453
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:17,109
moving on to usability one measure of

454
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,290
usability was the overall time that it

455
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:21,310
took to authenticate and unsurprisingly

456
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,319
universal second factors in push

457
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,139
authentication which require a single

458
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,490
tap were the fastest methods they have

459
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,950
the fastest meeting and authentication

460
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:33,040
times and especially when it comes to

461
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:36,010
compared to SMS some do a research from

462
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,409
2019 sound that push save the user 13

463
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:41,320
minutes annually while u2f say is a user

464
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,120
up to 18 minutes annually and so this is

465
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,159
going to save people time in the long

466
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,439
run if that's one thing that you want to

467
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,540
consider in terms of keeping your users

468
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,340
happy with authentication a lot of

469
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,720
people are concerned about adding 2fa

470
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,300
because they think it slows down the

471
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,220
signups slows down the login process and

472
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:01,840
there's proof here that there's faster

473
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:04,480
methods of authentication available but

474
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,330
another measure of usability was this

475
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,270
idea of a system usability score or

476
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:13,090
system usability scale and SQS or sauce

477
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:15,310
is a common measure used by researchers

478
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,139
who measure people's opinions on the

479
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,600
usability of these different factors and

480
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,090
so despite the fact that a lot of people

481
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,149
couldn't enter TOTP codes in this study

482
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:27,699
on their first try people actually liked

483
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,830
TOTP the best and I thought that was

484
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,300
really interesting finding here and

485
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,500
that's for the second factor is you

486
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,270
might notice that they actually like

487
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,730
just passwords they like passwords

488
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,780
without any - okay the most but that's

489
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,570
not really what we're concerned about

490
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,700
for a second factor TOTP was a most

491
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,080
successful but the usability scores for

492
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,030
all of them were actually kind of high

493
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,159
which I think it's promising people are

494
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:52,780
willing to use 2fa when they see it

495
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,580
working for them however we mentioned

496
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,020
the time to authenticate using some of

497
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,550
these factors there's somewhat of an

498
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,440
inverse relationship here with how

499
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,320
people felt about the factors versus how

500
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,650
fast they were so pushing u2f were

501
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,780
actually some of the lowest scored soft

502
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,520
scores even though they were the fastest

503
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,870
to authenticate and so the researchers

504
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,879
observed that faster authentication

505
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:14,830
doesn't necessarily mean higher

506
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,120
usability

507
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,919
so there are a lot of trade-offs here

508
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,020
and a lot of levels of security and

509
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,240
these options but I think it's important

510
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,850
to note that sms-based 2fa is still

511
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,320
better than no 2fa at all this is really

512
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,540
easy for me to say I work at a company

513
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,310
that does this right there's more

514
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,399
research on this to back me up

515
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:37,580
so in 2019 Google did this study that

516
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,180
said that SMS 2fa effectively blocks a

517
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:44,030
hundred percent of automated BOTS 96% of

518
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:46,430
bulk phishing attacks and 76% of

519
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,530
targeted attacks and so this is a really

520
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,900
good way of measuring the effectiveness

521
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:53,360
of adding this on top of just user name

522
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,430
and password and even though targeted

523
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,830
attacks still have a attack factor

524
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,840
available to them that's one thing that

525
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,669
we can consider but it's still better

526
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,250
than nothing at all even for companies

527
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,940
like Queen based a mandate to FA for

528
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,160
their users

529
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,050
they still support SMS face to sa

530
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,420
because they know that it's better than

531
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:13,010
not supporting anything at all or not or

532
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:17,330
allowing their users to get by without

533
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:18,950
2ff but when you start looking at push

534
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:21,679
authentication there is increased

535
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,450
protection so it increases the bulk

536
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,360
phishing attempt attacks to 99 percent

537
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:29,030
and a protection of targeted attacks to

538
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:31,820
90 percent you have different options

539
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:34,129
for your to FA but you also need to get

540
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,520
your users to enable it for at the added

541
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:39,410
security and so adoption of optional to

542
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,780
FA is something that's historically been

543
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,880
abysmal I read some research that said

544
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,550
that Dropbox quoted that something like

545
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,470
1% of their users have turned on to FA F

546
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:51,409
or Dropbox and there's a few reasons

547
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,150
behind the adoption for this the BYU

548
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,640
study that I've been mentioning found

549
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:58,160
that people were willing to add to FA if

550
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,410
they saw the value in the account but

551
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,940
there was still 13% of the participants

552
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,100
that just thought the inconvenience was

553
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,990
too high and so I think that we need to

554
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,060
educate users about the importance of

555
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,220
security here but also make it easy for

556
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,350
them to turn it on and make the options

557
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,240
for available to them to enable this

558
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:16,490
seamless enough that they're going to

559
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,870
see the value and going to make sure

560
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,630
that they enable this at their

561
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:23,300
convenience because a lot of people just

562
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,800
believe that they're not a target you

563
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,060
know this is from another research

564
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,500
participant

565
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,879
they said I just don't think I have

566
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,770
anything people would want to take from

567
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,510
me and so that's why I haven't been that

568
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,490
it's concerned about it and this might

569
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,560
be true for some accounts but depending

570
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,700
on what your company is protecting this

571
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,250
is something that you want to consider

572
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,290
of educating people about why they need

573
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,540
to turn on to FA and what they are

574
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:48,080
protecting and how to incentivize them

575
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,820
to do it all hope is not lost awareness

576
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,460
and adoptions almost doubled in the last

577
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,560
two years and so this is trim to do a

578
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,630
research from last year people that have

579
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,760
heard of to FA has increased to 77

580
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:00,920
percent out of 2019 and people who have

581
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,740
used to FAI has increased to 53 percent

582
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,200
in 2019 in one minute

583
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,060
and websites are getting more savvy

584
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,730
about how they're getting people to turn

585
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:13,220
on to FA there's some options that you

586
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,500
have available for this so product

587
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,480
incentives is one method for this does

588
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:22,750
anybody know what the spike in 2018 is

589
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:25,160
their fortnight so fortnight started off

590
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:27,740
incentivizing people to turn on to FA

591
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,170
and it's really funny because even

592
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,330
almost two years later three of the top

593
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:34,190
5 s related search queries to 2 FA

594
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,909
according to Google Trends have to do

595
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,070
with for tonight

596
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,740
epic games of su bones for tonight they

597
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,600
aren't the only ones offering incentives

598
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,630
MailChimp offers a 10% discount for

599
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,800
users that turn on to FA as well

600
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,120
so there's things that you want to

601
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,250
consider here but you also need to

602
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,510
measure your success and the one thing

603
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,430
that I want to point out here is that

604
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,230
you want to make sure that your losses

605
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,000
due to account takeovers are going down

606
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,040
but you also want to make sure that your

607
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,290
support costs relative to those losses

608
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,909
are also going down and that could mean

609
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:05,000
that your support costs are increasing

610
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:06,710
but that's a calculated decision that

611
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,350
you want to make in order to support the

612
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,850
added security for your customers so

613
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,100
there's no one-size-fits-all solution

614
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,260
here but the advice that I end up giving

615
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,100
most folks get boils down to this you

616
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,750
want to delight your most

617
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,300
security-conscious users and provide

618
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:22,340
some options for the rest because like

619
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,800
the security researcher Cormac Curley

620
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:28,429
says when we exaggerate all dangers we

621
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,870
simply train users to ignore us I hope

622
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,740
I've given you some inspiration for how

623
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,350
to think about your authentication

624
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,970
systems come find me after this if you

625
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,990
have any questions I will be up at the

626
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,790
Twilio booth once again my name is Kelly

627
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:43,410
and thank you for listening

628
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,409
[Applause]
