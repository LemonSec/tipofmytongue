1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,850
is secured by design usable security toy

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:16,560
right sorry I'm trying to figure out how

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,480
to hit the next slide okay cool

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,630
a little bit about myself my name is

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,119
Hancock I started working in tech as a

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,979
software engineer as sumo logic building

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,800
observability pipelines a couple years

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,869
ago and about half a year ago I moved

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,989
into InfoSec where now I work as a

10
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,269
security engineer at Cruz I built human

11
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,430
centric security experiences on security

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,710
I'm the security products team and I'll

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,430
elaborate a little bit bit more on what

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,770
I do next

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,800
outside of work I occasionally write

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,450
long-form thoughts on my blog on des and

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,620
I'm also on Twitter and can be reached

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,260
there if you'd like to say hi okay so I

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,769
joined the world of security about half

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,050
a year ago and like any new job I walked

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,059
around the office shook hands and did

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,949
introductions and most people were a

23
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,798
little curious about what my background

24
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,080
and what I did specifically so I say I

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,030
did a lot of usability and front-end

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,250
work previously and that caught some

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,900
people's attention a co-worker of mine

28
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,549
asked if I could take a look at

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,070
something he's been working on and maybe

30
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,810
help he showed me this tool that he

31
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,970
built for the OPSEC team that collected

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,790
data from reoccurring scans on internal

33
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,710
resources it was built API first and

34
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,210
then eventually they decided that they

35
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,158
want to use their interface to make it

36
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,380
easier for reasons like discover

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,490
building discoverability and learn

38
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,259
ability and they hacked together a UI

39
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:42,360
unfortunately this UI had a lot of

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,549
difficulty gaining adoption and some

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,590
people just outright avoided it someone

42
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:51,780
described it to me as an embarrassment

43
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,399
so unfortunately the product didn't

44
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,950
really represent the value of the work

45
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,509
done and he wanted to fix that so let me

46
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,600
show you some screenshots of the

47
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:05,490
redacted UI all right this is the home

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,709
page of the application there's four

49
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,930
buttons records repos home file ticket

50
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,750
and a bunch of mysterious

51
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,810
dspace as well so say we click on one of

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,180
the buttons alright we clicked on the

53
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,970
repose button this is a page with a

54
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,799
table of a list of all repos we have and

55
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,799
if you clicked on records you would see

56
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:32,040
nearly the same UI not shown in this

57
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:34,200
screenshot is that this table itself has

58
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,640
thousands of rows to it so you can

59
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:42,119
scroll a lot so let's let's look on a

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,470
table row all right so clicking on a

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,109
table row takes you to a resource

62
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,599
specific page and the output of any

63
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:51,319
scans done previously these three pages

64
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:55,078
cover a majority of the application so

65
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:57,208
let's take up that all in I'm sure some

66
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:59,819
of you all have thoughts on the UI and

67
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:04,409
UX of this experience but let's do an

68
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:06,328
exercise on what we've just seen from

69
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,739
there we can elaborate on why these

70
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:10,769
points can be especially problematic

71
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,870
it's in the context of security tooling

72
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,959
and don't worry about not being a

73
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,120
usability expert as people that touch

74
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,620
computers we're all qualified to form

75
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,359
opinions on how we interact with

76
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,840
technology all right back to the home

77
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,650
page

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,669
ok view all around 10 seconds to form

79
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,669
some opinions on this

80
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,230
all right so I'm sure a lot of you are

81
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,620
thinking about this already but why is

82
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,510
there so much white space it is like

83
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,670
something not loading correctly do I

84
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,160
have the right permissions to view this

85
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,410
in the first place what's going on so

86
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,480
why not put some information there if

87
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,090
you're using this app for the first time

88
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,890
this does not lend well to understanding

89
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,420
what the application does and that can

90
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,099
be really dangerous from a security

91
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:14,200
perspective because it makes the

92
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,200
application intimidating from the get-go

93
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,510
all right here's some here are all the

94
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,729
screenshots I showed earlier and let's

95
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,729
take maybe 20 seconds to form some

96
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:28,150
additional opinions and the usability of

97
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:28,150
these

98
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,169
so some things you can take a look at is

99
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,460
the general layout of the overall

100
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:49,030
application the URLs the whitespace etc

101
00:04:46,460 --> 00:05:03,820
etc if it like makes sense to navigate

102
00:04:49,030 --> 00:05:06,260
give you another 10 seconds all right so

103
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,200
why is the home button in the rightmost

104
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,630
part of the navigation this is not a

105
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,490
common design pattern and most websites

106
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,770
that use a horizontal navigation part

107
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:19,040
has a home page as the first button as a

108
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,620
left mouse button and why is this bad so

109
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,810
security is not always the easiest thing

110
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,450
to learn and having non standard UI

111
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,970
practices changes the context from

112
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,070
learning security to learning to use

113
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,710
this application and learning to use

114
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,480
security this adds a lot of unnecessary

115
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,669
brain cycles to something that is

116
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,340
completely unrelated to the original

117
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,410
intent of using this application when

118
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,570
you have enough of these seemingly small

119
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,480
quirks they really add up and make the

120
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:52,330
cognitive load of using your application

121
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:56,750
ineffective and slow here's another one

122
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:59,599
looking at these URLs they have the same

123
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,940
URLs for different pages so one of the

124
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,520
URLs is for the list of all resources

125
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,710
and the other one is resource specific

126
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,049
and they're the exact same so this

127
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,239
suggests that this application does not

128
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,880
support deep linking and that implies

129
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,010
that users have to navigate through the

130
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,550
entire UI again to get to a specific

131
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:22,070
state if you see something interesting

132
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:25,370
on a specific resource and want to show

133
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:27,860
a co-worker this co-worker would have to

134
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,590
navigate to the same page as opposed to

135
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,240
you just sending them a link this might

136
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,880
includes growing through hundreds of

137
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,800
rows on the table like that is slow

138
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,990
inefficient and that just makes it

139
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,240
difficult to use again and it also makes

140
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,240
collaboration unnecessarily difficult

141
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:50,060
alright so I redesigned and rewrote the

142
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,650
entire front end I fixed all the things

143
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,080
noted previously there's

144
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,669
homepage now there's also a navigation

145
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,969
bar that makes sense and deep linking

146
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:02,479
also exists but some of the other things

147
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,880
that usability improvements that came to

148
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,159
be is that the table is a lot more data

149
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,440
dense previously information in the

150
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,020
table created very tall rows and I made

151
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,500
it very difficult to perform search and

152
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:19,460
scan operations so previously in the

153
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,949
viewport they were about two rows per a

154
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:26,719
window and now you have a lot more and

155
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:29,380
this is also blown up so yeah and then

156
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,669
it's also easier to digest date/time

157
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,039
previously you had a lot of information

158
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:36,500
you didn't need and sometimes you just

159
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:39,320
want human friendly text and as people

160
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,900
that use you eyes we are humans and we

161
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,460
should be nice to ourselves if you

162
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,349
wanted that information you can hover

163
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:49,099
over that text and see that information

164
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:52,070
and lastly as the unspoken requirement

165
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:58,490
for all security tooling we have dark

166
00:07:52,070 --> 00:08:01,190
theme all right so like most security

167
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,720
teams when you find issues and

168
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,150
vulnerabilities you reach out to people

169
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,729
in engineering organizations for

170
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,070
mediations and fixes so this happens

171
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:12,620
quite often and in some of these

172
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,539
interactions the developers got a little

173
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,720
curious about this application that all

174
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:19,820
these security engineers were using so

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,310
they asked what is this tool that I

176
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:27,070
don't have access to can I get access to

177
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:30,889
it and how do I get access so let's stop

178
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:33,529
we have a mental shift from security

179
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:35,870
folks doing security to engineering and

180
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,390
security people doing security this

181
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,630
human friendly UI empowers people to do

182
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:45,050
and secure things by themselves we're

183
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,300
decreasing friction and makes are we are

184
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,120
decreasing friction to security and it

185
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,439
makes all our lives much easier if you

186
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,870
want to build constructive relationships

187
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:00,020
having user-friendly tools

188
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,450
it helps motive motivate engineers to

189
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,199
champion security tasks this question

190
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,130
represents

191
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,220
a shift they shift from reactivity to

192
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,340
proactivity around security by enabling

193
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,870
your people and let's remember why we

194
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,910
build security products in the first

195
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,100
place we build and maintain these

196
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,839
services and tools to enable the rest of

197
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:26,240
the organization to maintain its

198
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:29,840
security posture and culture so what is

199
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,000
usability in short it can be broken down

200
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,380
into effectiveness efficiency and

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,840
satisfaction

202
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,480
notice how nowhere in this definition

203
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,480
does it say usability means aesthetics

204
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,610
it doesn't oftentimes usability gets

205
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,650
pigeon-holed into just visual design and

206
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,120
that's just not true things like

207
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,579
command-line tools can benefit from

208
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,010
usability thinking get the version

209
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,900
control system had a recent update where

210
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,730
it broke down get checkout and to get

211
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,670
switch and get restored

212
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,560
why because having one command do two

213
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:05,719
different things is confusing and

214
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,810
unnecessary so would you ever build a

215
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,540
security tool that is not effective not

216
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:14,390
efficient and not satisfactory sounds

217
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,130
really dumb right so usability should be

218
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:21,620
the top priority for any sort of

219
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:23,240
security decision okay UI before API so

220
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,220
Dan is a large finger in the front-end

221
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,680
community for his work around react and

222
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:31,010
redux he also clarified in this tweet

223
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,310
that he uses UI and UX interchangeably

224
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:37,580
and there's also grateful a blog post if

225
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:41,920
you look it up but as a takeaway from

226
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:46,340
this let's talk about it more abstractly

227
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,439
so api's are an abstraction on how a

228
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,350
person might do something on a computer

229
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,890
and at the same time api's are four

230
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:57,740
machines turns out api is also create

231
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,900
constraints these constraints enable

232
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,090
people to do things they also prevent

233
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,770
people from doing things and lastly they

234
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:07,660
enforce people to follow a particular

235
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:11,150
interaction pattern so let's hold up

236
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,920
aren't API is just abstractions for how

237
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:16,910
a human might interact with the computer

238
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,880
and an AI yeah

239
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:22,339
um api's are abstractions for how humans

240
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,550
interact with computers but why should

241
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:28,940
we let an abstraction for a machine

242
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:31,010
dictate how we as humans do things in an

243
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,130
ideal world we need to be thinking about

244
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:36,740
the user first also in an ideal world

245
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:45,640
usability considerations exist at the

246
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:48,610
start of any security decision so

247
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,990
hopefully I've sold some of y'all and

248
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,000
prioritizing usability and your security

249
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,010
tooling so what are some actionable

250
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,780
things that we can do to get the ball

251
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,150
rolling

252
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,560
so if you have designers go talk to them

253
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,170
come best friends with them they're

254
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,540
really cool people if your product is

255
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:08,089
internal your designers already interact

256
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,310
with your engineers a lot already and if

257
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,380
your product is external your designer

258
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,729
is almost a hundred percent already have

259
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,130
a deep understanding of your

260
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,230
organization's customers you can find

261
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,060
out what's in place for user research

262
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,420
and maybe even find people to champion

263
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,510
your cause second point is inventory

264
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,089
what work already exists do you have a

265
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:32,210
component library a design system a

266
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:34,250
cruise we had a UI kit that a lot of you

267
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,350
a lot of engineers were building with

268
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,230
already but the security team wasn't

269
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,390
utilizing it using known resources means

270
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,390
you're making new experiences feel

271
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:46,280
familiar people know what interaction

272
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,620
patterns exist in their current tooling

273
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,689
so why not use those patterns in your

274
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,880
security tooling by benefiting from

275
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,160
these known design patterns and makes

276
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,070
your application less intimidating

277
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:04,360
easier to learn and my favorite last

278
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:07,160
work for me so for feedback and

279
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,990
evaluation of your existing tools here's

280
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,469
what you shouldn't do and it should be a

281
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,900
combination of both so if you're

282
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,540
including others in your research you

283
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:20,000
should do user research and that means

284
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,089
gathering others doing surveys doing

285
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,250
interviews getting an idea of how people

286
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:27,020
interact with your application seeing if

287
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,640
anything's confusing if there's any

288
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,230
workflows that you never thought of in

289
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,030
the first place

290
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,450
the other thing is a heuristics

291
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:37,699
evaluation a heuristics evaluation is a

292
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,650
usability inspection method used to

293
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,050
identify any design issues associated

294
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,329
with your user interface

295
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,699
I said Nielsen and parentheses because

296
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:49,040
Nielsen heuristics are ten very

297
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:52,040
well-known and general principles for

298
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,949
interaction design I have three of the

299
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,439
ten listed below so for example

300
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,360
recognition rather than recall in the

301
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,940
image that I have on my slide you can

302
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,850
see the fonts are displayed in a font in

303
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,140
the form of that particular font so when

304
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,510
you choose it you already have an idea

305
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:12,260
of what it looks like so let's put this

306
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,880
in a security tool in context say you're

307
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,700
giving someone permissions to access

308
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,090
something that requires you to input

309
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,550
their email and you now need to know

310
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:25,070
their entire email before they have

311
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:27,589
access to something a usability plus

312
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:30,280
that you can add to your form would be

313
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:32,780
autocomplete instead of having someone

314
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,319
recall and type out the entirety of that

315
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,870
email

316
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,240
now a couple keystrokes and hopefully

317
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,240
you can recognize and identify the right

318
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,190
person for those access permissions if

319
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,950
you're doing a heuristics evaluation

320
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,140
definitely take a look at Nielsen's

321
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,840
heuristics there are ten which can be a

322
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:57,319
lot but focusing on a couple can really

323
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:58,970
help you get started all right so if you

324
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,520
learn nothing else from this talk

325
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:04,790
remember this effective security is

326
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,590
secured by design security has a lot of

327
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,020
tough and important problems and

328
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,270
unusable solutions gets us nowhere

329
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,760
let's think of poor design as an

330
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,400
inherent flaw or vulnerability to any

331
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,530
sort of solution if you have an unusable

332
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,939
security tool and no one wants to use it

333
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,910
and it doesn't really help get the job

334
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:26,360
done why bother why have them build an

335
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,910
unusable product I mean no one starts

336
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,220
off writing something and going like I

337
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:36,170
am going to build an unusable product no

338
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:39,170
one does that that's pretty silly so why

339
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,939
do we have unusable products well if you

340
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,729
don't prioritize usability from the

341
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,600
get-go

342
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:47,160
very easily becomes unusable so

343
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,170
effective security is really secured by

344
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,930
design and there's a lot of amazing

345
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,089
security products out there but that but

346
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,660
the work that interfaces with us the

347
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,089
humans

348
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,189
it doesn't really always add up your

349
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,709
user interfaces should represent the

350
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,959
value of your work as the world

351
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:07,589
discovers how important security is

352
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:10,079
let's make sure it's effective efficient

353
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:12,300
and satisfactory thank you all so much

354
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,380

356
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:20,250
questions since I finished pretty early

357
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,990

358
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,430
I've ever given and I wanted to give

359
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,529
thanks to a bunch of people that helped

360
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,479

361
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:30,570
