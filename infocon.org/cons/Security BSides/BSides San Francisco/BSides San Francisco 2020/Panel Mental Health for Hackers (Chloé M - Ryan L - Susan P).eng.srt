1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
all right welcome welcome welcome thanks

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,580
for hanging out with us I know there's

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,090
an open bar

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,679
right next door and I just wanted to say

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,860
that this talk is gonna share some

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,299
personal stories um so whatever happens

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,340
this room I know it's not gonna stay in

8
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,980
this room but the good news is that your

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,840
Q&A session will be private it will not

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,300
be recorded so if you have any personal

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,130
questions on these topics do not worry

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,439
you are not being recorded and if you

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,179
feel awkward about doing that we'll also

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,390
be in the hallway for a good 20 minutes

15
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,540
afterwards so we can help you guys out

16
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:39,629
so before we begin I just want to say

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,760
that overall in InfoSec we all work

18
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,559
really long hours and not just that we

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,430
work all the time because that is

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:46,980
security

21
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,460
it's all ours and because of that we all

22
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,819
run into depression burnout and as well

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,829
as anxiety so I'm gonna let my wonderful

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,070
panelists next to me introduce

25
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,070

the time out this afternoon to I think

43
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,570
about yourself and mental health and

44
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,729
what it means to be well in this hackers

45
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,829
world my name is Ryan Louie I'm a

46
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,840
board-certified psychiatrist I work with

47
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,309
a medical group called VY 2d and I

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,750
actually work in a hospital right here

49
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,490
in San Francisco in between Knob Hill

50
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,680
and Tenderloin at the st. Francis

51
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,509
Memorial Hospital in the psychiatric

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,799
unit and I've been really interested in

53
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,149
just working with different people from

54
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,180
different walks of life different

55
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,460
backgrounds and here in this this room

56
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,079
here hackers and cyber security and

57
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,449
about mental health so I think we could

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,098
have a great conversation together my

59
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,810
name is Claire mr. Yee I'm the VP of

60
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,038
strategy over at point three security

61
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,510
I'm also the founder

62
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:18,689
women hackers and the co-founder of whoa

63
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:21,149
sec women of security and I am so happy

64
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:22,379
to be here today because mental health

65
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,019
hackers is one of those organizations

66
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,090
that every single person in the space

67
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,459
should know about and so we get to touch

68
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,900
on that a little bit later but first I

69
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,849
think we need to talk about what we're

70
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,170
actually dealing with I did mention that

71
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,420
we work all hours

72
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,689
I mean sometimes we'll be working at

73
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,518
2:00 3:00 and the weekends and Brenna is

74
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:44,269
really prevalent and what ends up

75
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,980
happening is that were basically also

76
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:49,799
self-medicating ourselves many of us are

77
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,828
drinking some of us are doing drugs some

78
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:55,079
of us are doing risky behaviors and some

79
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:58,530
of us use food as a way to protect

80
00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:00,959
ourselves or to help us cope and I'm

81
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,250
really happy to have Ryan here who can

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,459
actually share a little bit more on the

83
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,680
medical side of things so we can share a

84
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,530
little bit more about the truth out

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,010
there about mental health Ryan it's up

86
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,949
to you sir so first of all I just want

87
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,629
to let everyone know that deep down

88
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:21,239
mental health is not just something for

89
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,159
a certain profession or a group it's not

90
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,419
just for psychiatrists it's not just for

91
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,519
people who are trained in mental health

92
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:29,760
it's actually everybody because deep

93
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:33,180
down everyone already has it in his or

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,798
her own DNA and and if you think back to

95
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,690
mental health and what it means for you

96
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,449
just think back to your own experiences

97
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,099
and think about how it made you feel how

98
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:43,260
do made you think what kind of actions

99
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,810
did you take just kind of reflect on

100
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,569
that and everyone has the permission to

101
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,760
do it themselves so so keeping an open

102
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,649
conversation so in terms of mental

103
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,448
health just as a general background you

104
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,790
can tell from the slide that it's super

105
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:59,669
super common I'm sure that maybe someone

106
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,709
has a very likely to have known someone

107
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:04,260
with a mental health condition and maybe

108
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,599
even ourselves or what a friend or a

109
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,269
family or a colleague and it's a very

110
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,939
very very common and oftentimes it

111
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:14,069
starts very early in in life sometimes

112
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:17,099
it happens in middle age and sometimes

113
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,440
older older people get it also so

114
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:22,560
there's a wide spectrum but they're very

115
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,780
common and and oftentimes being aware of

116
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,370
it and detecting it

117
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:30,349
and doing something about it it's what

118
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:32,300
it's all about too often times people

119
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,889
talk about stress in that maybe some of

120
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,389
you in the audience have seen this curve

121
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:37,730
it's actually made over a hundred years

122
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:40,430
ago called the uruk's Dodson curve I

123
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,020
didn't talk about this idea of like

124
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,480
there's different levels of stress and

125
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,430
different types of stress overall

126
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,639
meaning that if you see on your left

127
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,650
side that if it's not stressful enough

128
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,880
it's kind of boring you know it's like

129
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,919
it's the same old same old

130
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,300
you know they could do the job probably

131
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,729
do it pretty well but it's not really

132
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,900
that fun and then when you kind of

133
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,940
ramped up the stress a little bit you

134
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,960
get kind of like in the middle zone

135
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,610
where you kind of feel like yeah you

136
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,070
know it's pretty stressful and it was

137
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:10,100
challenging and it was hard and you know

138
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,719
we we stayed up pretty late and you know

139
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,700
I went through some hard times but

140
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,410
overall I think it was good it was a

141
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,539
good it was a good time we're learning a

142
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,940
lot you felt you grew as a team grew as

143
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,710
a person and then as you start getting

144
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,590
towards the right side get into the bad

145
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,630
stress and that's when stuff starts

146
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,280
going downhill you start noticing that

147
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,350
you know there you're not feeling

148
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,450
yourself you're not feeling like the

149
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:37,310
work is worth it and just overall not

150
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:39,710
not feeling that good so um Chloe and

151
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,140
Susan have been very kind to share some

152
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,489
stories have both personally and the

153
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,440
things that they've seen and I'll also

154
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,940
share some things that I've that I've

155
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,110
seen as well but maybe we could launch

156
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,640
by going into the field of anxiety all

157
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,270
right you're looking at me so I will

158
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,930
start recently you probably maybe saw

159
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:02,000
that I wrote an article for a tripwire

160
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:05,360
talking about openly about having

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,880
anxiety so myself in 2011 I experienced

162
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,530
my first panic attack and it was the

163
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,740
scariest thing in my life I'm not gonna

164
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:15,739
lie I literally thought I was dying and

165
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,560
I didn't know what was going on and so

166
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,080
basically ever since then I think for

167
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,000
about a good four years I would have a

168
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,280
panic attack every single month and

169
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,080
every time I did I saw the symptoms

170
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,719
which was the tingling sensation in my

171
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,130
toes and going a little bit higher up

172
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,810
and that's when I realized I'm gonna

173
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,370
curl up in a ball and I'm gonna put my

174
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,560
timer on for eight minutes because I

175
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,030
figured it out that if I put the timer

176
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
on for

177
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,229
minutes I know this is just a panic

178
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,790
attack and I'm gonna be okay so it's set

179
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,470
my timer for eight minutes krill bin a

180
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,420
ball and think of as many positive

181
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,580
things and reinforcing the idea that

182
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,710
once again I'm having a panic attack now

183
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,500
the issue with that was that during this

184
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,510
time I was scared to go out and about

185
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,730
because I didn't know when it was gonna

186
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,320
hit so imagine you're like in a crowd

187
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,880
like this and then suddenly like you

188
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,260
start feeling this sensation you're like

189
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,510
I can't breathe

190
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,550
we're gonna do you go to the restroom

191
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,740
where everyone else is in there I mean

192
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,600
at RSA as a woman maybe you won't have

193
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,820
anyone in the restroom but here there's

194
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,440
a good amount of people and it was

195
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,780
really hard and I realized what was

196
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,820
happening was it was based over control

197
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,559
because when I was little I planned

198
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,170
everything to tea it's like at the age

199
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,330
of 23 I'm gonna do the following things

200
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,250
at the age 25 I'm gonna do the following

201
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,050
things and you know what happens it

202
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,390
doesn't happen and then that's when you

203
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,590
start having the panic attacks and that

204
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,340
was one of the lessons that I definitely

205
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,810
learned so I'm pretty sure this slide is

206
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,630
me right now

207
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:44,550
being on a panel at besides SF and

208
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:46,990
having anxiety it's it's apropos but

209
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,490
being at cons in general I think that

210
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,860
they're slightly anxiety inducing

211
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:53,230
there's so many people and it's a

212
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,420
sensory overload almost which is again

213
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,740
why mental health hackers does what it

214
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,190
does and tries to provide a chill-out

215
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,440
room at conferences when it's invited

216
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:04,360
and then also from personal experience I

217
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,550
think the time I feel anxiety the worst

218
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,280
is usually when it's there's like an

219
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,930
impending deadline and you just want to

220
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,640
make sure it's the perfectionist in me I

221
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,810
want to make sure I'm turning in like

222
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,870
the perfect product the perfect

223
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,430
deliverable and it's it's probably like

224
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,770
the worst experience until I finally hit

225
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,470
Send and it's gone and there's nothing I

226
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,870
can do about it then so I'm sure we all

227
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,790
have there's hundreds of examples I can

228
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:33,520
give you right now but yeah

229
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:35,500
keep it short yeah thanks to Susan Chloe

230
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,780
I mean a lot of these things that you've

231
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,090
described as I'm sure everyone kind of

232
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,159
has felt some part of that at some point

233
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,710
in their life and it's a it's anxiety

234
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,630
can be a normal response of stress it

235
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,160
protects us so lets us know that there's

236
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,960
bad things out there and then we got to

237
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,980
be careful and just kind of avoid it or

238
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,170
deal with it and

239
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,290
kind of keeps us alert but when anxiety

240
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,000
becomes kind of like a more serious kind

241
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,459
of thing is then when it becomes somehow

242
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,040
out of proportion to what would be

243
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:06,099
appropriate for either at that situation

244
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,529
or the stage and life of a person or the

245
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:13,000
context of it so it's a it's a it's kind

246
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:15,820
of a scale almost and and anxiety

247
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,769
disorders are super comments so lots of

248
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,980
lots of lots of people are can be

249
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:23,800
affected by it several different types

250
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,260
of anxiety and and on the internet and

251
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,750
different sources there's a lot of

252
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,850
information there so you just just as an

253
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,649
example for educational purposes you

254
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,560
know there's different types of anxiety

255
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:37,720
there's panic disorders there's there's

256
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,459
a generalized anxiety disorders where

257
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,370
there's anxiety about things in general

258
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:44,888
and broad things then you get into

259
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,920
things like social anxiety disorders

260
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:51,670
where where there's social situations

261
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,740
that that cause the anxious feelings and

262
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,569
and things of that nature then you have

263
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,779
to all the different kind of phobias and

264
00:09:55,569 --> 00:10:00,729
and oftentimes we've heard in the media

265
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:02,709
about various phobias and there's

266
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,949
constantly new ones so but all of them

267
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:08,079
have this element of anxiety and then

268
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:10,180
finally there's a anxiety that's

269
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,170
oftentimes caused by things that are

270
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,149
beyond mental health or psychiatry

271
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,849
things to do with substances like drugs

272
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:21,970
and alcohol in their medical conditions

273
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,190
and finally there's other things that

274
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,600
are related to anxiety such as PTSD and

275
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,589
what we call that justment disorder

276
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,420
meaning that there's something that

277
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:30,190
happened and people are trying to adjust

278
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,740
the best that they can to take care of

279
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,600
this so I listed on the right side of

280
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,449
the slide just various kind of symptoms

281
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,490
and I'm sure these are very familiar to

282
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:42,519
everyone who's ever felt panicked or or

283
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,430
anxious essentially the queasiness

284
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:47,620
sweating palpitations feeling uneasy

285
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,790
don't feel like eating you know can't

286
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,380
sleep all that kind of stuff

287
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:54,939
so and just a brief educational slide

288
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:58,180
about treatment the most important thing

289
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,399
is to is to find someone that you trust

290
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,410
find someone that you trust in and don't

291
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,790
be afraid to go out and reach out and

292
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,980
get some help if this could be a

293
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,660
friend a close colleague a mentor

294
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,160
someone that you could go to say hey you

295
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,469
know there's there's something going on

296
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,949
I I want someone to talk to about this

297
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:18,290
kind of thing and and you and maybe

298
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:20,210
after speaking and self-reflecting get

299
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,250

300
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:25,100

309
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,460
tips on how to handle anxiety and the

310
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,100
general thing I like to tell people is

311
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,440
find something that you feel that you

312
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,540
could do on your own that you can feel

313
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,920
happy about that you feel satisfying and

314
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,170
that you feel personally rewarding

315
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,699
because that's what's gonna keep you

316
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,290
going when things get tough you want to

317
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,360
be able to make sure that you could do

318
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,819
the things that you enjoy and of course

319
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,320
you know get get people involved I get

320
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,570
get people that you trust involved get

321
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,840
get doctors and physicians on board and

322
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:13,580
and get it all comprehensively moving

323
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:17,540
forward then we're going to talk about

324
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,850
some depression I guess I'm going first

325
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,199
again

326
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:24,500
okay so I've never been clinically

327
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,750
depressed and so what I've gone through

328
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,610
is episode depression which is from an

329
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,680
event that occurs in your life where

330
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:34,340
suddenly you get depressed if symptoms

331
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,890
this depression for me I had a breakup

332
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,770
with someone that I loved so much and

333
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:43,340
hurt me really bad and a week later I

334
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:45,290
lost my job so I was a complete I was

335
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,330
just a disaster in a sense like I was

336
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,380
crying like every single day I was

337
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,200
putting on weight trenee

338
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:55,040
like put some sort of barrier around me

339
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,110
some way and it was just crying a lot

340
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,480
and no one knew about it because I was

341
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,270
also being very productive also looking

342
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,480
for a new job so that lasted for like

343
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:08,600
months on end maybe I should have gone

344
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,060
first because she took my answer but no

345
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,130
it's very much the same where I think

346
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,199
anytime I've ever felt depression it's

347
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,540
always been event driven

348
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,910
and I always felt very selfish for

349
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,230
labeling and as depression I felt like I

350
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,110
shouldn't do that because I know people

351
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,900
in my life who have been diagnosed with

352
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:29,780
depression manic depressive and like

353
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,650
Khloe said it's all usually you're still

354
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,069
high-functioning

355
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:37,550
you're still seemingly normal until you

356
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:41,150
go home and you're on the floor and it's

357
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:43,969
always been like breakups or the job

358
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:49,250
really having some sort of failure at

359
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:50,750
work family induced but yeah it could be

360
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,300
any of those things but I'll leave it to

361
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:56,600
Ryan to talk about actual depression

362
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,640
like the symptoms and everything Chloe

363
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,130
and Susan brought up a great point in

364
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,810
that the idea of depression there's

365
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,430
always going to be some points in life

366
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,780
that definitely that you know people

367
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:07,819
feel down there's gonna be ups and downs

368
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,650
for sure and oftentimes people ask you

369
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,120
know hey is this like actual depression

370
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,560
or we just feeling depressed or just

371
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,920
feeling kind of stressed like how this

372
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,079
is all kind of work in in many cases

373
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,699
it's a we have a common language in

374
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,130
psychiatry - clinically that I know

375
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,510
something but in actuality it's all the

376
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,850
same biology we are all the same

377
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,160
molecules we're all the same cells

378
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,710
inside our body and it's it's a gray

379
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,870
zone actually to be able to say like you

380
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,460
know what's kind of like okay stress and

381
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,140
what's kind of like super stressful and

382
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,780
what's clinically you know completely

383
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,240
serious it's oftentimes a gradation and

384
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,430
to be able to know where each person is

385
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,290
in terms of his or her own life and what

386
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,689
feels right what doesn't feel right I

387
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,910
think each of us knows ourselves the

388
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,250
best so just kind of keep that in mind

389
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:54,589
and keep it open mind towards being

390
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,080
aware of oneself and we could get places

391
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,070
so but in terms of psychiatrists and

392
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,660
then people in the mental health field

393
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,460
in terms of what actually depression is

394
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,430
that is the diagnostic Statistical

395
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,620
Manual called the dsm-5 and it's the man

396
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,260
of all the clinical diagnosis so you

397
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,240
know we have criteria that that that are

398
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,100
used to actually diagnose depression so

399
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,750
I'll leave this up here on the on the

400
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,640
sly for everyone to read but essentially

401
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:19,250
it's stuff like don't feel like hanging

402
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,439
out with people don't feel like doing

403
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,750
things for fun feeling kind of guilty

404
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,590
you're not just guilty but

405
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:26,930
inappropriately guilty maybe too much

406
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:29,120
guilt about stuff that happens feels

407
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,589
like you know you don't want to

408
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,420
you know hang out with people with

409
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:34,220
having problems concentrating your

410
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,140
you're fine like you're eating too much

411
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,480
or either to a little same for sleep

412
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,220
sleeping too much sleeping to too little

413
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,660
hard to get out of bed hard to get

414
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,630
started these are some of the things

415
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,980
that people kind of describe and feeling

416
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,620
depressed for most of the day and

417
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,930
sometimes even getting to the point of

418
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,930
having thoughts of self-harm or maybe

419
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:56,810
even suicide and and that's when that's

420
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,910
when things get very serious and it's

421
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:03,670
time to look out for each other in

422
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:06,770
ourselves to try to get some help and

423
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:09,439
similarly the symptoms some of these are

424
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,720
our physical manifestations like in

425
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,240
terms of what our bodies feel when when

426
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,550
when we get depressed and um and again

427
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,930
oftentimes these are felt and other kind

428
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,420
of mental health conditions as well they

429
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:22,310
kind of overlap with anxiety and

430
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,979
depression but it all points to the fact

431
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,469
that we're human bodies where were human

432
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,960
beings and everything that affects us in

433
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,110
one part of our mental health oftentimes

434
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,720
kind of leaks over to other things so

435
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:39,110
again we talk about things like feeling

436
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,670
feeling depressed and down overall so

437
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,620
I'll leave this up and and I think these

438
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,719
slides will be available for people and

439
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:50,390
certainly contact us and we'll send you

440
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,250
a copies and treatment wise overall it's

441
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,980
its idea of don't don't do it alone

442
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,060
that's the general message you know you

443
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,770
find someone you trust

444
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,529
I get it get the help of a professional

445
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,970
you get I go see a counselor a therapist

446
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:03,860
someone that you could talk to you just

447
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,179
so that you're not by yourself so that

448
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,010
you've got people around you you got a

449
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:09,380
team just like here I besides you know

450
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,030
no one's doing cybersecurity or hacking

451
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,650
and things like that no one's doing it

452
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,670
by themselves you know although it's an

453
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,439
individual endeavor

454
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,030
deep down it's a community effort so

455
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,770
that's you think about everyone in this

456
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,420
room everyone's sitting here so this is

457
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,000
what we do we all we all do it together

458
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,140
and the things at the bottom are when we

459
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,089
talk about when things get really

460
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,820
serious in terms of danger to self

461
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:31,428
danger self harm so these are certain

462
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,169
some of the flags that we could look out

463
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:35,090
for ourselves or to our for our

464
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:38,480
colleagues in terms of you know what to

465
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:40,520
look out for and things like wanting to

466
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,960
end things maybe getting things

467
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,990
organized preparing

468
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,210
for things maybe by their their change

469
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,520
in their behavior and maybe their

470
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:52,250
outlook or the way they do things and in

471
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,918
the way they say things so so just kinda

472
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,380
looking out for everyone to continue

473
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,090
with the talk about suicide I think many

474
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,580
of us have lost someone in InfoSec

475
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,139
because of suicide and it's really

476
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,029
important to talk about that there's two

477
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,399
different types of suicide and usually

478
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:09,500
we don't really know about this the

479
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:11,779
first one is an active thought an active

480
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,850
thought is like today next week next

481
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:16,399
month next year I'm gonna take this many

482
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,740
pills on this one day and I'm gonna end

483
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:21,320
it all now another one it could be

484
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:24,080
sudden where you're like you look for a

485
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,760
blade you see it and you're like I can't

486
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,289
do this anymore like this is it I've had

487
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,450
thoughts this is the time to do it

488
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:32,870
that is one of those things that is an

489
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:35,000
active moment now there are suicidal

490
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:38,870
tendencies and passive thoughts passive

491
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,980
thoughts can be anything from I am going

492
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,658
to not look in my rear window I mean my

493
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,340
mirror and I'm just gonna go and merge

494
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:48,380
into the outline and if I get hit I hit

495
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,760
I get thrown iodide and this is great

496
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,110
for me because I don't want to do this

497
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,970
anymore

498
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:56,059
another thing could be not looking when

499
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:59,450
crossing the street these are other ways

500
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:01,129
to spot suicidal thoughts and I'm pretty

501
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,200
sure that most of us at some point in

502
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,230
our life know someone who has gone

503
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:14,480
through something like this or ourselves

504
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:17,510
as well we're gonna move into the area

505
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,279
burnout and when Susan and Chloe showed

506
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,779
me the slide you know in terms of

507
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,190
InfoSec I said why is that just three

508
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:25,250
years going from baby Yoda

509
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:27,529
it's like Master Yoda and like a Jedi

510
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,029
Master but but overall it puts the

511
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:31,789
general idea that this is thing called

512
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:33,169
burnout and essentially you know let's

513
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:35,450
talk about what burnout is you know I

514
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:36,799
think everyone kind of knows to some

515
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,240
degree like you know what it was what it

516
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,889
sort of feels like in terms of burnout I

517
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,600
kind of liken it to this like when your

518
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,610
cell phone battery like for me let's say

519
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,469
I'm tweeting a lot and then it you know

520
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,299
it goes down to 10 percent 5 percent 3

521
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,940
percent Oh starts turning red stars

522
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:52,039
blinking stuff this the screen start to

523
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,960
dim and then I can't do other functions

524
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:55,280
I everything runs really slow and it's

525
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,920
it gets the

526
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,480
phone suddenly knows that that they just

527
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,100
need to preserve the most basic things

528
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,710
make phone calls send messages and

529
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,820
somehow get whatever data if we can

530
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,040
something like that you know we gotta

531
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,990
make the most of what's going on so I

532
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,420
for burn out its when the energy is

533
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,850
essentially all drained out emotional

534
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,940
depletion is is one of the features it's

535
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:19,459
the idea that just drained it's this a

536
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,620
flashing red icon on your cell phone

537
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,810
detachment cynicism oftentimes people

538
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,939
start making off-color jokes and making

539
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:28,970
comments about different things at work

540
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,280
or or about about life in general or

541
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,710
about different problems and then it

542
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,030
starts to become something noticeable

543
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,310
that there's kind of detached from their

544
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,690
work low personal achievement this idea

545
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,220
that hey you know this is when I first

546
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,870
joined this this job is really fun I

547
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,300
really really excited I want to do great

548
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,340
things in the world and build my career

549
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,409
and and kind of go for it but after well

550
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,330
it's it kind of levels off a little bit

551
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,340
maybe even kind of goes downhill in

552
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,260
terms of like hey it's not what I

553
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,790
thought it was anymore and in

554
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,560
depersonalization it's the idea that

555
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,330
it's not connected to you as a person

556
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,940
anymore some people describe it as like

557
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,830
looking at yourself in a film or looking

558
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,390
at yourself as if you were an exhibit at

559
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,030
a museum or something like that so all

560
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,100
these things are are signs of burnout

561
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,260
and interestingly burnout is not part of

562
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,840
that dsm-5 manual that I talked about

563
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,120
it's actually a condition that's not

564
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,500
officially a psychiatric illness but

565
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,229
some people think that it's on its way

566
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:24,010
to depression but whatever it is it's a

567
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:28,190
it's it's it's affecting people's lives

568
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:29,560
and also interrupts sorry so we were

569
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,720
gonna share personal stories about this

570
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,980
and I really wanted to make sure I spoke

571
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,010
on this one because this is the one that

572
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,260
I experienced most recently so I was

573
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,820
with a consulting company I'm not

574
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,470
working right now for this reason for

575
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,290
burnout specifically so I was with a

576
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:49,700
consulting company for 14 years at 14

577
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:51,230
months Jesus 14 years and that whole 14

578
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,870
months I didn't have a single vacation I

579
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,240
didn't have a day off I took three weeks

580
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,370
off to go do my reserve duty and they

581
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,750
counted that as my time off when I asked

582
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,639
for time off they were likely just took

583
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,080
three weeks off and I'm like to go serve

584
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,660
in the reserves I mean that's not really

585
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,419
sitting on the beach with a drink in my

586
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,370
hand so

587
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,420
I try to ignore it kept trying to ignore

588
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,330
it I was like let me just make it to one

589
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,890
year made it to one year had prana

590
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,000
clients had a project going on I was

591
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:20,130
like okay let me just make it to the end

592
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,930
and my body Ryan talked about physical

593
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:25,150
manifestations and my body was just not

594
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:27,280
going to let it happen anymore so come

595
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:29,890
July I was having a migraine every

596
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,360
single day it's just literally as soon

597
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,060
as I woke up in the morning it was

598
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,879
migraine and I kept ignoring it took my

599
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:40,360
migraine medicine later on about a week

600
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,680
later I developed a facial twitch and I

601
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,969
went to the doctor and I was like I

602
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,170
can't get this to stop and he was like

603
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,440
that's because you're about to either

604
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,270
have Bell's palsy or have a stroke so

605
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,270
that was the day that I put in my two

606
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,190
weeks notice and I quit my job and no

607
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,240
regrets about it I knew that it was the

608
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,070
right thing to do I had the support of

609
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,170
my friends and family when I tell people

610
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,550
about it they were like good for you it

611
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,190
was just something that was necessary

612
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,210
and I needed to that was one of the

613
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,440
reasons why I really wanted to make sure

614
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,460
I spoke today because I was like it's

615
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,740
just something that we want to keep

616
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,490
pushing through and ignoring but after a

617
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:15,880
while like you just can't anymore that

618
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:17,560
picture was literally me Oh Chloe I

619
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,080
don't know if you have any um so and

620
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,940
before I wanted to InfoSec I was in

621
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,399
humanitarian work and that I also

622
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,650
included education I was placed in

623
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,870
Oakland a school district to work with

624
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,450
special ed kids and I was not trained I

625
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:34,479
had kids that were being prostitute at

626
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,210
the age of like eight or nine I had kids

627
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,920
that were being stabbed multiple times

628
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,540
like in other places of their bodies so

629
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,480
wouldn't anyone would be able to notice

630
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,190
it I was dealing with kids that saw

631
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,590
someone get murdered in front of them

632
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,180
and I was not trained for this and I

633
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,280
remember just being so burned out

634
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,140
because not only that but people quit

635
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,760
all the time in special ed in Oakland

636
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,950
cuz there's no resources for you and

637
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,300
you're like where did the money go

638
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,610
and the thing is is that with that

639
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:03,190
burnout people leave and then you take

640
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:05,500
on their cases so suddenly it was had 12

641
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:10,210
kids and then suddenly it went up to 42

642
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,680
and I was not doing good and if you

643
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,990
heard a little bit earlier about being

644
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,820
in a car and you're looking in the

645
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,560
mirror you're like well what happens if

646
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,779
I just don't look when going to the

647
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,940
other lane and that was the moment

648
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:23,499
I realize like okay I'm burned out I

649
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,239
need to get out this is not good for me

650
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:28,210
if I'm having these type of thoughts and

651
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:30,009
yeah the same thing you recognize it but

652
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:34,599
sometimes it's too late and it's really

653
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:37,239
important to recognize that now yeah and

654
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,158
and and and the idea of recognizing it

655
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:40,989
now doing something now that's so

656
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:43,029
important like everyone here is at this

657
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:46,239
session as you it's the last day of

658
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:47,830
besides SF reflect on the people that

659
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:49,299
you've met here today reflect on the

660
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,559
sessions that you've been there ideas

661
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:52,029
that you were thinking about in and

662
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,408
think about what this means for you and

663
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:55,210
and where do you like to be checking

664
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:57,279
where yourself constantly is it's a

665
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,070
great place to start so that's how we

666
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:03,460
could start to tackle these ideas and

667
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:05,408
things I believe in the power stores I

668
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,719
think Susan and Chloe have have have

669
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:09,580
shared very powerful stories so with

670
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:11,649
everyone I'll just leave the slide up

671
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,928
just general physical scientists signs

672
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:15,820
and symptoms of burnout things to do

673
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:18,009
with behavior emotional signs but I

674
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,869
think overall from the stories that

675
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:22,450
we've heard I think I think that

676
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:24,549
encapsulates very well about this idea

677
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:30,429
of what it means to feel when you feel

678
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:31,658
burned out oftentimes people talk about

679
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,999
what's the difference between stress and

680
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:36,399
burnout and this is a slide that we got

681
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,989
off the internet there but but in

682
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:39,309
general sometimes it's kind of gray and

683
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:41,619
sometimes it's kind of hard there's no

684
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:43,839
delineation in terms of stress and

685
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:45,070
burnout oftentimes one goes on to the

686
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,009
other side and the other one comes on

687
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,570
the other side but in general stress as

688
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:51,639
we talked about that curve there could

689
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,320
be good stress bad stress everything in

690
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:55,209
between kind of stress when it becomes

691
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,158
burnout is when you when you start

692
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,869
hitting that red battery so the red

693
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:04,749
battery flash and battery got to do

694
00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:06,728
something and there's different types of

695
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:08,710
things that can cause burnout they could

696
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:09,879
be caused by things that the workplace

697
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,869
that's the most common things that

698
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:16,059
people hear about that that causes a

699
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:18,070
burnout and stress things like not

700
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:20,229
having control over your work having not

701
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,839
given enough resources to do the work

702
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:25,119
you've been assigned to dynamics between

703
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,249
colleagues and just really stressful

704
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,839
high-pressure kind of environments it

705
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:30,460
could also be caused by lifestyle kind

706
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,139
of things like maybe things in terms of

707
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,149
not being able to turn off when you go

708
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:35,070
back home like you know

709
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:36,570
you clocked out you're done for shift

710
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:38,399
but you're back at home when you should

711
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,479
be enjoying stuff with your family but

712
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:41,849
then you're thinking about work and

713
00:26:39,479 --> 00:26:43,769
checking your phone and and and trying

714
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:46,379
to do stuff like that sometimes it's a

715
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,639
it's built into each of us and we talked

716
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:49,080
about that idea that everyone's

717
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:51,089
different and everyone has a different

718
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,889
level of threshold for what stress is

719
00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:55,349
good and when it's bad and sometimes

720
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:57,689
this could be built into our own DNA our

721
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:59,189
own personality so being aware of that

722
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,239
and what works for us and what doesn't

723
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:06,179
is oftentimes a big step to go forward

724
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:08,489
and again treatment in general it's it's

725
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:10,019
again don't do it by yourself

726
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:12,929
you know just go out and find people

727
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:15,210
that you trust go out and get some help

728
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:17,159
and then talk about what might be needed

729
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,929
different things that we could treat not

730
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,719
just burnout but also depression anxiety

731
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,909
sometimes it could be used there could

732
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:26,309
be medications for for for treatments

733
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:27,749
sometimes it's talk therapy sometimes

734
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:29,129
it's a combination of both and

735
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:30,690
oftentimes we try to look for the

736
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:33,238
underlying cause so just solve the

737
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,879
underlying cause try to try to find into

738
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:37,409
that and and there's a whole bunch of

739
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:38,998
different kind of ways to manage

740
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:40,529
symptoms so I'll leave this up for

741
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:43,429
everyone to take a look at it but I

742
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:46,409
generally find people that you trust

743
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:48,419
find a group of people that can help you

744
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:50,940
out do something that you enjoy that you

745
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:53,279
feel you could do on your own just out

746
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,889
of enjoy ability and keep moderation in

747
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,869
in terms of things that you do and

748
00:27:55,889 --> 00:28:02,849
always keep tabs on yourself too to

749
00:27:57,869 --> 00:28:05,070
understand where you are I think this

750
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:06,869
whole presentation we're trying to show

751
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:09,960
that you should never go through

752
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:12,119
anything alone I mean we are a community

753
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,710
of people that like we have many of our

754
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,839
dams are open and we're always trying to

755
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,249
help each other out and I think that's

756
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,168
one of the things that keeps us in this

757
00:28:17,249 --> 00:28:21,239
room and keeps us going to be sides s of

758
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:23,129
it it's it's the community and we need

759
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:25,710
to be part of that and just note that

760
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:28,498
like it's very hard to talk openly about

761
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,609
your situation but there's plenty of

762
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:32,729
people out there that are willing to

763
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:35,570
look into and help you out anytime you

764
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:35,570
want started dry throat

765
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:40,769
honestly I think the industry needs to

766
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,769
change we need to be a little bit more

767
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:46,990
open about these things and also to have

768
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:49,540
open dialogue the other thing is that

769
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:51,640
you know we usually treat anything but

770
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,670
the health concern pretty well so like a

771
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,410
broken leg diabetes but we never really

772
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,610
do anything when it comes to people that

773
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:00,400
are dealing with like depression anxiety

774
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,840
and PTSD and whatnot and that's one of

775
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,990
the things that we really need to talk

776
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,809
about because it does impact us in our

777
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:10,270
everyday work at the same time and we're

778
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:16,540
still going through the stigmatism that

779
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:18,490
come with mental health as well so like

780
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,200
I was saying share your experiences is

781
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,540
going to be really important but also

782
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,679
you can do is reach out to the resources

783
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,230
that we're going to share towards the

784
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,230
end and also note that you can actually

785
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,660
build a support network yourselves to to

786
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,670
help each other so everyone has someone

787
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:40,630
that they can call when they need

788
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:42,970
someone to talk to now change in the

789
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:45,010
workplace like I said earlier if someone

790
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,440
has a broken leg you take that seriously

791
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:49,390
you're like you can stay home you can't

792
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,530
walk it's totally fine but we should

793
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:53,170
also do that when people are dealing

794
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,190
with some things and mentally and that's

795
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,410
one things that we need to change

796
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,120
because a lot of us when we're going

797
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,380
through something we don't tell HR we

798
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,399
don't tell our manager because we're

799
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,620
coming where we're going to get fired

800
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,260
let's be real and that's a real problem

801
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,659
but the other thing is that if we don't

802
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,490
say anything then we might get end up

803
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,470
game fired because we were dealing with

804
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,070
something and we're not getting the

805
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:17,440
right treatment that we need so just

806
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:20,590
remember that is that if a company is

807
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,870
not going to help you out at all you

808
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,139
shouldn't be working there period and

809
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,219
before we actually basically announce

810
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,140
that we're going to be doing this talk

811
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,480
we started doing research ourselves and

812
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,730
we asked the community do you have any

813
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,980
employer that has helped you with your

814
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:40,660
mental health we got zero responses and

815
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:43,150
that's just letting you know the problem

816
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,070
is very real and we are definitely being

817
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,450
overworked and especially when someone

818
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,550
leaves our team we're taking on more

819
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,200
work and we're not being respected or

820
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,610
appreciated so this is why it's really

821
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,309
important if you're a manager in this

822
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:57,300
room please push something forward this

823
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:57,300
is really important to do

824
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:04,650
so I wanted to give you some quick facts

825
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:06,960
about mental health in the workplace go

826
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,610
off of what Chloe just said depression

827
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,810
and anxiety have a significant economic

828
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:15,209
impact the estimated cost globally is

829
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:19,590
one trillion per year in lost

830
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:21,690
productivity due to mental illness work

831
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,399
is good for mental health but being in a

832
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:24,990
negative work environment can lead to

833
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,670
physical and mental health problems like

834
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,400
we've already Illustrated

835
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:33,090
who here has worked a negative work

836
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:37,050
environment before kind of surprised

837
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:40,220
there's not everybody but I need to know

838
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:42,480
where you work so I can apply there so

839
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,100
it's usually through like some

840
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,860
harassment or bullying at work those are

841
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,740
the commonly reported problems they can

842
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,439
have a substantial adverse impact on

843
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,450
your mental health unemployment is a

844
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,330
negative risk factor on mental health

845
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:59,940
but returning or getting work it has a

846
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:03,090
positive impact negative working

847
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,770
environment can lead to as Chloe stated

848
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,540
before it can lead to physical and

849
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:10,530
mental health problems but also harmful

850
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:12,750
use of substances or alcohol it can also

851
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:15,899
lead to absenteeism and the lost

852
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:19,860
productivity for every one dollar that's

853
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:23,840
been put into a skilled treatment in a

854
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:26,669
company they see a common return of $4

855
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,000
in improved health and productivity so

856
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:32,990
it's a 400% return for any company that

857
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,030
does invest in these kind of programs so

858
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:38,150
to move on to that we don't want to

859
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:41,580
present just or bring light to this

860
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:43,110
problem we want to potentially give you

861
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,590
solutions to that you might be able to

862
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:48,360
take back to your employer or if you are

863
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:51,030
a lead in a company maybe take these

864
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,169
initiatives back so some of the changes

865
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:55,050
that you can do in your workplace

866
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,220
give your team flexibility so you want

867
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,840
to invest in mental health in your

868
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,650
workplace and you're not sure where to

869
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,080
start let the employees choose so one

870
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:05,940
option is potentially a monthly stipend

871
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,370
that can be used at their choice for

872
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:13,260
therapy appointments massages meditation

873
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:15,719
apps gym memberships spa days

874
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,050
and then potentially healthier working

875
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,610
hours so we had talked to someone about

876
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:24,379
how they were kind of drowning at work

877
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:27,899
and their supervisor recognized this and

878
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:30,150
changed his work hours and he was almost

879
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,560
instantly happier and healthier so

880
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,540
everybody has like different rhythms

881
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,460
some people are early birds and people

882
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:38,370
are night owls having that level of

883
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,980
autonomy at your work sometimes really

884
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:45,560
helps and resonates with the people and

885
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:48,420
it's apparent in their productivity so

886
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:51,629
next slide we talked about getting

887
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:54,000
employee buy-in and so there were

888
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:56,160
several companies on inks 20 19 best

889
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,070
workplace lists that said that they

890
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,500
offer monthly and annual stipends but

891
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,649
employees don't always take advantage of

892
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,400
these benefits even the short-term ones

893
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,740
short-term services for people

894
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:11,850
struggling with perhaps like addiction

895
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,590
or personal problems of some sort and so

896
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:16,500
only half of the employees were actually

897
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:19,230
aware that they were given this benefit

898
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,530
so awareness to your employees is huge

899
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:24,179
if you do offer these programs and

900
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:26,010
getting employee buy-in is easier and

901
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,129
smaller companies usually because of the

902
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:31,139
tight-knit culture that they have there

903
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:33,210
and having leadership again as Chloe

904
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,639
mentioned that's open about their own

905
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,199
struggles with mental health so if you

906
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,149
have I mean even if you're not in a

907
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,960
position of leadership just being open

908
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:46,319
and vocal sometimes just helps everybody

909
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,389
else employees that see that mental

910
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,610
illness isn't shameful it can be managed

911
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:53,280
and more likely seek help before they're

912
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:58,410
in crisis and potentially lose their

913
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,670
jobs so next slide so one of the other

914
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,830
things an employer can do is making it

915
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,900
easier to get help so opening the

916
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:06,299
workplace dialog is one way and teaching

917
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,610
coping strategies is another you can go

918
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:12,240
a long way in aiding employees mental

919
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:14,210
health and sometimes people just also

920
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,310
need professional treatment though so

921
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:20,940
while most health insurance plans cover

922
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:24,180
some mental health care therapy can be

923
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:28,260
very expensive even with the insurance

924
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:31,440
so one of the things that they're doing

925
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,660
to close the gap is companies are

926
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,220
turning to online services and then to

927
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:38,069
the next point they're actually bringing

928
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,560
in-house professionals so one of the

929
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:43,320
there was an Illinois based accounting

930
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,990
firm that provides all of their

931
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,960
employees with access to a psychologist

932
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:52,290
on the company's dime and during the

933
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,210
company time at their location so it

934
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:57,390
makes it super accessible for the

935
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:59,310
employees to take advantage of and the

936
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,810
company also started bringing in a

937
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:06,810
certified life coach to work with

938
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:08,400
employees at least once a year and it

939
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,960
wouldn't be a talk at a cyber conference

940
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,050
unless we mentioned metrics at some

941
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,170
point so how would you measure that this

942
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:18,090
is actually working and I mean the the

943
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,230
program sound good in theory but you it

944
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,190
can be difficult to measure their

945
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,130
success because how do you measure

946
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:25,050
happiness and there are a few things

947
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,410
that you can do potentially track

948
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:30,200
productivity the quality of output as

949
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:35,850
well as the turnover rate and

950
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:37,020
absenteeism inside so I told you I'd

951
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:40,350
talk to you about mental health hackers

952
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:42,630
a little bit I was privileged enough to

953
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:46,650
be at Derby con 8 and it all began out

954
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:48,720
of a tweet our illustrious CEO Amanda

955
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,190
Berlin info sister a lot of people know

956
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,500
you know her his info sister on Twitter

957
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:54,720
she's just amazing and she's spoken

958
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,700
about mental health extensively and

959
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,709
she's done many talks at cyber cons

960
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,210
about them and she saw that this was a

961
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,670
problem and she wanted to present a

962
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:06,510
solution so she went to the creators of

963
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:08,160
or the people who run Derby con and they

964
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,810
were super supportive and they gave her

965
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,230
a room and they said you know have a

966
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:15,270
mental health village and she invited me

967
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,730
to teach yoga and and I jumped on the

968
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,740
chance to go to Derby and be able to do

969
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:21,240
this for her and that's where it all

970
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,669
began for us was Derby Khanate in

971
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,259
October of 2018 it was such a success

972
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:27,090
and it was so well received by the

973
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,730
community that we knew it had to be

974
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:31,620
something so she formed a board I think

975
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,880
our board members are listed on the

976
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,660
slide so please

977
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,820
go and follow them on Twitter and by

978
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,740
November just the following month she

979
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,360
had us incorporated as a non-profit and

980
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:48,450
by April of the following year we were a

981
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:51,030
501c3 we received our status on that

982
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:54,029
which was amazing so our goal is to have

983
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:57,750
hackers helping hackers and we kind of

984
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,860
say it's a a for mental health one of

985
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,840
the things that we want to grow into

986
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,480
because right now we provide mental

987
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:06,270
health villages at various cons and in

988
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,790
our first year we did cons in three

989
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:11,550
countries and and 10 in in 10 different

990
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:14,160
states and upcoming in 2020 we're

991
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:16,620
already committed or speaking to 12

992
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,020
other cons and what we do at our mental

993
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:22,980
health village is we have presentations

994
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:24,870
and discussions yoga like I mentioned

995
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,970
before we have massage chairs which

996
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,440
people love who doesn't love getting a

997
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:31,859
15 minute massage in the middle of the

998
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,830
day and then we have different tables

999
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,420
set up so there's like a fidget table

1000
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:39,420
coloring adult coloring books setup we

1001
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:42,630
have a crafts table we had a session on

1002
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,640
paracord crafting knitting essential

1003
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:47,300
oils there was a therapy dog that showed

1004
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,220
up that people really loved we filled a

1005
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,630
unicorn cool with like beads and people

1006
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,629
loved running their hands through it it

1007
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,800
was it was crazy but we want to be able

1008
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,170
to do this more and we want to be able

1009
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:00,150
to expand and one of the things we want

1010
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,760
to do is there's a mental health first

1011
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,320
aid training out there and we want to be

1012
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,490
able to bring that to the hacker

1013
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,440
community

1014
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:10,200
it's basically CPR for mental health is

1015
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,690
the way that we like to look at it we

1016
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,980

1027
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:37,080
village we're there for you and I just

1028
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,540
want to mention that I do have stickers

1029
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:43,560
and swag afterwards for anybody who

1030
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,630
wants them yes so just find me after I

1031
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,490
absolutely love the fidgeting stay

1032
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:50,040
so the first time I found mental health

1033
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:51,750
hackers was an B says Austin and I was

1034
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,279
like there's so many things I can like

1035
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,320
play with while I was like waiting to

1036
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,240
get a massage I was like this is

1037
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,340
luxurious like I wish every conference

1038
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,950
had this because I could use a massage

1039
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,890
every time but it made me feel really

1040
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:06,629
comforted for sure I think it lets you

1041
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,920
know that you're not alone like I said

1042
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,510
it's sensory overload so it's nice to

1043
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,640
take that break but it's also like a

1044
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,050
room of people who are just there for

1045
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,910
each other that's what the discussions

1046
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,350
like I think the first one at Derby

1047
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,149
eight there was like we went through so

1048
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,799
many boxes of tissue like there was

1049
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,010
sharing their stories and they're just

1050
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,630
crying it was great it's very cathartic

1051
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:26,520
and I and I first heard about a mental

1052
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,500
health hackers actually on Twitter and I

1053
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,880
think Amanda ended the whole team and it

1054
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,560
was Susan everyone they've done really

1055
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,050
exciting work so I was really happy to

1056
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,160
see that people cared a lot too to put

1057
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:39,330
something together for people in the

1058
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,160
hacker community overall we're really

1059
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:43,799
hoping that when you guys walk out of

1060
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,170
here that you kind of want to give back

1061
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:48,960
in a sense because we need to all come

1062
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:51,150
together to change what needs to be

1063
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,280
changed at this point but most

1064
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:55,380
importantly you do not know what each

1065
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,990
person is going through so please be

1066
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,940
kind and that means on Twitter I'm

1067
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:02,220
looking at everyone in here be nice on

1068
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,320
Twitter because you do not know how

1069
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,700
that's going to impact a person so if

1070
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,080
even if you want to troll you're gonna

1071
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,240
have a snarky remark that's cool and

1072
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:13,500
everything but think about it before you

1073
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,569
press tweet we have a really good page

1074
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,420
for you and I'm gonna ask for everyone

1075
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:20,700
in this audience to take a photo of this

1076
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,890
I want you to share this everywhere if

1077
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,960
anyone ever were to connect with you and

1078
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:27,450
be like I'm dealing with a situation I

1079
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,790
want you to send this photo to them post

1080
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:32,580
on Facebook post on LinkedIn post it

1081
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:34,890
everywhere you possibly can because that

1082
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:38,370
is how we let people know about the

1083
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:41,160
resources that are available now like I

1084
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:43,790
promised we're gonna stop the recording

1085
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,410
so if anyone wants to ask some questions

1086
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:48,750
don't worry it's not being recorded and

1087
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:51,600
if anyone asked any questions please

1088
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,340
keep that within the room meaning don't

1089
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,810
bring it out don't share it that this

1090
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,550
person did this or talked about this

1091
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,000
literally just keep it in this room

1092
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,230
please and I know

1093
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,640
whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas

1094
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,079
and we're not in Vegas but let's be real

1095
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,180
every time we ride like how people are

1096
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,180
taking photographs okay so
