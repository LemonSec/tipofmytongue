1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,779
and now enough of me rambling like to

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,610
introduce flea who is the the C so at

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,860
gusto he's going to be doing a keynote

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,259
on giving give away securities Legos

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:22,970
dumping traditional security teams leave

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:25,859
Italy take a second here to get set up

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,500
it's a interesting intro and in

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,029
particular it's always good I guess get

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,250
these talks like kicked off but like

10
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,170
some somewhat scary things like reminded

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,750
the K there's this crazy virus going on

12
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,460
and oh yeah by the way which I did not

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,239
know I'm not being paid for this okay

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,610
thanks that's good to find out like and

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,800
and you know I probably should have read

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,989
that guideline early about not being an

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:55,289
ass so bear with me I will attempt so um

18
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,669
you know as we mentioned my name is flea

19
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,309
I'm gonna be talking to you about this

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,500
idea of giving away your security Legos

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,180
I tried to hack you make this talk a

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,739
little bit more friendly and less

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,510
violent in the language I actually

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,979
decided to say dumping the traditional

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,960
security team as opposed to killing the

26
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,810
traditional security team but I guess I

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,339
snuck that in there anyway so I'm plea

28
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,479
worked at a couple of security companies

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,700
that actually worked at a couple

30
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,900
startups you know I have a history at

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,640
square at Twilio I'm now at gussto or

32
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,140
react you focus on building a people

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,180
platform and actually one of the great

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,939
things about all these adventures has

35
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,400
been that emphasis on building I learned

36
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,408
a ton at Twilio about the power of code

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,090
and what it means to be a builder took

38
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,189
that on further at square and just

39
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,960
really really elevated myself now at

40
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,449
gussto I'm not only thinking about what

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,949
I can do that keep build with code but

42
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,530
also what I can actually do a building

43
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,570
with people but also what I want take a

44
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,939
step back I think as a lot of you

45
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,610
probably my first exposure to building

46
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,470
was Legos I love Legos everybody likes

47
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,240
Legos maybe if you're a parent you may

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,670
not like Legos so much in particular if

49
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,189
you find them laying around etc was

50
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,899
actually just one of those really great

51
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:06,059
accessible tools that I think everybody

52
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,320
can use and if you figure out and

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,128
actually pay attention to Lego you like

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,959
to build some things that actually

55
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,450
marvelous and fantastic

56
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,040
so maybe actually take a little history

57
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,839
of Legos

58
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,099
I don't know at a minimum you'll come

59
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,760
away from this talk with just some

60
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:23,119
random useless Bar trivia so leggo Becky

61
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,030
a ridiculously old company and the word

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,069
leggo actually come from the Danish leg

63
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,079
dot and I'm sure I mutilated that but

64
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:31,879
that kid means played well and I love

65
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:35,870
that in particular when it comes to

66
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:38,328
security oddly enough that she started

67
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,950
out by building wooden toys and I was

68
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:41,090
like the whole deal is like hey kids

69
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,219
need things to play with the critter

70
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,900
that goes much later than that he went

71
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:46,700
on to build these plastic toys we all

72
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,470
know about but it's a key one of the

73
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,290
things that everybody resonates with all

74
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:54,319
across world everybody knows about Legos

75
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:57,048
it is the most powerful brand in the

76
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,409
world one thing that I really really

77
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:04,189
latched onto with Legos was their motto

78
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:05,989
which is the best is not too good I'm

79
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:07,939
totally stealing that so everybody

80
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:11,359
actually works with me at gusto that's a

81
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:13,578
new thing I'm reeling at you but that's

82
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:15,950
just a little bit of background on Legos

83
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:18,109
and this is also to set you up for a

84
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,879
really really really extended and

85
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:21,349
drawn-out analogy so you can actually

86
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,459
see a lot of Legos and a bunch of slides

87
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:28,280
I want to start off though talking about

88
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:30,250
the stereotypical company and immediate

89
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,530
disclaimer I know that your company is

90
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,209
special and it's a snowflake and you do

91
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,010
things better than anybody else you have

92
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,409
nothing in common with anybody else so

93
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,269
just take this with a grain of salt that

94
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:43,668
these are just broad generalizations and

95
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:44,479
like most other stereotypes it's not

96
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:47,510
true

97
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,669
I want to talk about companies though

98
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,978
because how we interact with companies

99
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,840
as security professionals and some of

100
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:56,419
the things that we think about and take

101
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,250
for granted you know we kind of think

102
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:59,720
that companies are like these monoliths

103
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,970
actually you know fighting against us

104
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,069
etc and I just want to bring back those

105
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:08,720
key aspects of the company companies

106
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:11,569
exist to solve a problem for customers

107
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,629
and ideally they want actually do that

108
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:15,828
in the most efficient way possible and

109
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,820
at the end of the day what they're

110
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,099
trying to do is they're trying to take

111
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,829
all of their Legos and build something

112
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:23,670
great like a company that is doing well

113
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,770
is meant to grow

114
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:28,980
and extend itself and continue growing

115
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,780
and extending itself every company even

116
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,920
the tiny little baby companies for so

117
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,750
for those you're working at the ten

118
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,700
person start-up your temperature startup

119
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,380
is complex for those you working at the

120
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,520
you know huge model lifts there are a

121
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,440
hundred thousand two hundred thousand

122
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,890
employees obviously that's really

123
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,600
complex no company is actually simple I

124
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,190
think one of those other things that we

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,750
often think about as security

126
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,490
professionals in particular we think

127
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,170
about the size of your security team or

128
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,400
maybe the reach you have and that the

129
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,470
company doesn't care about security

130
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,690
that's actually not true your company

131
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:02,250
cares deeply about risk but it cares

132
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:05,640
about all risk so let's take a look at

133
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,900
the stereotypical security team at some

134
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,780
of these political up stereotypical

135
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,280
companies and this will probably make

136
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,070
you sad because it makes me sad whenever

137
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,469
I think about it is I personally did not

138
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,510
sign up to be a cop but a lot of the

139
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:22,050
tasks that traditional security teams

140
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,539
have often look like cops it's like oh

141
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,640
well I'm here to make sure that nothing

142
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,540
bad happens I'm gonna keep all the bad

143
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,580
people out I'm going to say no to you

144
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,620
and you're not allowed to do X Y & Z you

145
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,180
can't have a Linux laptop you can't have

146
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,000
a MacBook you have to have this shitty

147
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,070
Windows PC all these kind of things that

148
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,290
we think about when other people at

149
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,960
least as they experience security have

150
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,180
to deal with this you know the other

151
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,849
really really weird thing to get to see

152
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,580
about security teams is that oftentimes

153
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,350
we're the ones pointed towards when

154
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,180
something bad goes wrong it's like hey

155
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,310
my company got popped

156
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,110
Oh security what happened why did we get

157
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,820
hacked what went wrong why don't you

158
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,140
stop all the hackers you should've been

159
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,880
doing everything possible and

160
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,400
eliminating all risks cuz you're the

161
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,980
security team it doesn't actually feel

162
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,890
like that even more interesting is when

163
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,930
you look at how security teams our staff

164
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:18,060
inside of companies it doesn't seem like

165
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,930
we're necessarily set up for success in

166
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,100
the traditional security team model like

167
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,440
most companies that you look at and this

168
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,700
is hand-wavy anecdotal I found some

169
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,090
stats on the internet so you know it's

170
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,610
true most companies security teams are

171
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,080
less than 1% of the company and there's

172
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,760
definitely some anomalies out there some

173
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,370
companies are doing fantastic things and

174
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,199
really in

175
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,790
testing insecurity the smart ones

176
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,500
recognize that security is a competitive

177
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,750
advantage but not all companies are

178
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,330
smart and not all companies also have

179
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,510
that same approach so in general you are

180
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,430
always outnumbered and always outdone at

181
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,289
least that's what it feels like but

182
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,389
probably the worst thing about a

183
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,280
traditional security team is that they

184
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:58,720
really look like a bunch of people that

185
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,530
are just going through sec oh yeah let

186
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,570
me take a look at that

187
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,638
oh I prove it oh let me take a look at

188
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,240
that oh that's really yucky I'm gonna

189
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:09,340
you know deny that repeat etc etc and

190
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,770
it's such a weird things I never thought

191
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,900
that I would turn into a bureaucrat and

192
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,030
that's effectively what it feels like a

193
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,299
lot of traditional security teams are

194
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,559
doing it's like you know did I sign up

195
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,720
to be a hacker that I found to be an

196
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,240
accountant I personally think that

197
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,400
security teams are probably a large part

198
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,870
of these success for Atlassian just

199
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,000
because of all the dirt Achatz that we

200
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,710
file and put people through so I'm

201
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,150
really grateful that it lasts in is a

202
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:39,219
sponsor looking at least we're getting

203
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:40,620
some of that money back but seriously

204
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,669
like how many people in this room

205
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,130
haven't secured him a part of your

206
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:49,570
function is you're required to do design

207
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:51,580
reviews oh that hurts or you require

208
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,020
someone actually review access and say

209
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,370
oh this person gets to have permissions

210
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,049
or oh I need to actually look at this

211
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,669
vendor I need to look at this one person

212
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,919
company I need to look at this little

213
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:01,450
crappy chrome plug-in I got to look at

214
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,880
every single piece of software that I

215
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,889
could comes in there I did not sign up

216
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,080
for that that is a horrible experience

217
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:10,000
all the years that I actually spent

218
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,490
trying to at least be a real security

219
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,520
person doesn't feel like that when I'm

220
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,580
just doing a bunch of paperwork I wanted

221
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,710
to do deeply technical work not just be

222
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,449
in somebody else's way and causing

223
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,750
friction and frustration for other

224
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:27,849
people part of that though is because of

225
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,289
Miss that we have to tell ourselves and

226
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,049
a lot of things that we kind of

227
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:35,588
perpetuate about what it means to be a

228
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:37,359
security professional there's all these

229
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:39,909
things that we actually want to believe

230
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,650
like one is this idea that we're not

231
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,059
drowning I also don't understand what

232
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,670
this kid is so blissful and also where's

233
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:48,160
this kid's parents whatever I'm not a

234
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,469
parent so maybe I don't know

235
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,819
but it's like all these weird things and

236
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,440
we're at stereotypes to be perpetuate

237
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,990
like this idea that security is the

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:00,160
smartest team I have worked with a lot

239
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:02,710
of dumb security people a lot of dumpy I

240
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,839
consider myself dumb as well but it's

241
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,370
this idea that when we show up we know

242
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,720
better than developers and that

243
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,700
developer doesn't know what he's doing

244
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,840
and that you know she's gonna go out and

245
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,610
she's gonna craft something that's gonna

246
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,200
just destroy the company and I have to

247
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,750
be there watching over her shoulders

248
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,520
otherwise she's gonna make a mistake one

249
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,740
of my favorites though is this idea that

250
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,410
all the reviews that we do are actually

251
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,360
that meaningful do you really believe

252
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:29,469
that the design review you performed is

253
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,110
the same code that is in production how

254
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,480
do you guarantee that I've definitely

255
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,160
experienced where yep security did the

256
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,730
sign-off and something else completely

257
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,890
different is in production the other odd

258
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,390
thing I find is this idea that security

259
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,610
is too hard there definitely are some

260
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,900
complex things in security like if you

261
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,330
were to ask fleeta actually do some

262
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,640
crypto work you're gonna have a bad time

263
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,780
everybody's gonna be unhappy but we do

264
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,790
know that people can learn these things

265
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,829
and it's not one of the things that only

266
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,290
security professionals can do but we've

267
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:02,410
caught perpetuated this mist that only

268
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:05,890
security people wearing a hoodie with

269
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:09,819
purple hair I don't have hair etc can

270
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:12,280
actually do these things it led to this

271
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,190
idea that we perpetuated ourselves that

272
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:17,350
we need to control everything that if

273
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,180
somebody is trying to build something we

274
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:24,700
need to be holding on to a lot of those

275
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:26,620
Lego blocks I think that's done think

276
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,600
about this idea of us and a company

277
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,020
trying to build something and they said

278
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,740
hey we want this multi rainbow

279
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,060
architecture something like all these

280
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,310
various things who actually trying to

281
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,229
piece together etc but when you think

282
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,420
about security as a gate we're the ones

283
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,420
holding all these red blocks why

284
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,420
this is appropriate because there's film

285
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,860
in the matrix in San Francisco right now

286
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,959
but no seriously like what if there

287
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,310
actually was a better way and that's

288
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,850
what I'm pitching to you and hopefully

289
00:10:52,310 --> 00:11:00,319
get you to at least think about how we

290
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:02,900
should be practicing security what we

291
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,440
really want to do and what the company

292
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:09,079
needs and deserves is secure outcomes a

293
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,600
secure outcome does not need to be done

294
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,050
by a security professional or someone

295
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,120
who has security in their title we need

296
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,780
to be flexible around that in order to

297
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,030
allow other teams to help us have those

298
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,449
secure outcomes and to encourage them to

299
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,819
drive towards secure outcomes at the end

300
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,650
of the day some of the most powerful

301
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:35,380
individuals in your company are the

302
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:37,370
developers help the developers be better

303
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,900
so I hear what you're saying it's like

304
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,430
okay well you gave this nice little

305
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,970
pitch and it's all doom and gloom and

306
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:45,709
security sucks and what should we do now

307
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,140
and this is where this whole idea of

308
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:50,660
actually sharing our Legos comes into

309
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,600
place how can we actually allow more

310
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:56,719
people to participate in our ecosystem

311
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,530
and hopefully take more vacations and be

312
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:03,290
on call a little less then what you do

313
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:06,199
this is you actually make it everybody's

314
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,939
job I know I know every single person in

315
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,360
here their company says security is

316
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,850
everyone's job but is that real I don't

317
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,490
feel like it can ever be real because in

318
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:20,450
a lot of companies when something goes

319
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:22,460
wrong the security team is blamed one of

320
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,950
the competitive advantages that

321
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,950
companies like square or Netflix or

322
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:31,250
gussto has is this idea that the

323
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,690
decision-maker owns the risk and they

324
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,300
own the consequences that go along with

325
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,490
that but there's so much power in that

326
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,380
of me showing up as a security

327
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,510
professional saying hey I'm here to help

328
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,360
but you can make whatever decision you

329
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:47,420
want but you have to live with that

330
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,060
decision and if we get pop if something

331
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:54,469
goes wrong we hurt one of our customers

332
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,209
that is you not me now we're definitely

333
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,220
there to

334
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:59,920
poor people and health make you really

335
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,709
be successful but that idea of actually

336
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,979
owning the outcome and the consequences

337
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:07,479
associated with that outcome dries

338
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,629
phenomenal behavior and it is so

339
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:14,259
positive and it's just a great way to

340
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:16,059
practice security you know part of the

341
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:18,759
reason why I like this model is that

342
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:21,550
security never has all of the context I

343
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:23,949
will never under I'm a horrible product

344
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,089
person so like when Twitter launch are

345
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:27,490
like oh this is the dumbest idea ever

346
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:29,290
that's never gonna go anywhere when

347
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,689
Facebook launched oh that's never been a

348
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,618
bore anywhere who would ever want that

349
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:33,998
Fitbit who wouldn't want some kind of

350
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:35,589
tracker like looking in their lives

351
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:37,179
except I'm a horrible product person I

352
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:39,100
can't figure out how to make the same

353
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:41,379
decisions that they do and also don't

354
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,839
know the same concerns I would argue to

355
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:46,240
say that since security is primarily an

356
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,999
external entity or an external team to

357
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,769
other teams we will never know all the

358
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:52,779
nuance of what they're working with we

359
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:55,209
don't know their code base as well we

360
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,069
don't know what their customer feedback

361
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,589
really is and we don't know how some of

362
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:03,639
our decisions are going to impact those

363
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:06,519
customers by pushing this back onto the

364
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:09,069
teams and giving them more freedom we're

365
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,920
also reducing that process overhead and

366
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:13,449
this is how we really scale when you can

367
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,110
say hey I'm going to help you set up

368
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:20,049
processes I'm going to give you code etc

369
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,549
you can actually scale a four-person

370
00:14:20,049 --> 00:14:23,199
security team of five person and

371
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:24,939
security team at in person and security

372
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,389
team sometimes even a one person

373
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:30,429
security team so I know what you're

374
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:34,869
asking all right fleet I'm bought in

375
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:37,959
what should I be giving up when I talk

376
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:40,089
about this idea of sharing the red Legos

377
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,489
there's all kinds of things that we

378
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:44,049
should be pushing back on to other

379
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,589
people in particular we've got to get

380
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:48,490
rid of gates

381
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:51,490
I personally rarely see gates be truly

382
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,319
effective at driving secure outcomes

383
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:57,220
even more so

384
00:14:53,319 --> 00:15:00,939
gates slow your company down one of the

385
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,490
biggest risk to companies is shipping

386
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:05,139
the wrong thing or shipping something

387
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,609
too late

388
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:12,009
you don't want security that could be

389
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:13,989
part of that reason this you know next

390
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:15,429
point exactly a no-brainer the debit

391
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:18,160
should be doing the code of you they

392
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:19,629
will know the code much better than we

393
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,819
will and they know the entire ecosystem

394
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:25,239
of what that code looks like where it

395
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:27,729
lives etc better than anybody on the

396
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:29,439
security team I would love to see more

397
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,179
product managers themselves actually

398
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:33,519
lead those threat models we can teach

399
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:35,079
them how to do a threat model if you

400
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,449
know joy foresight she has this

401
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:38,769
phenomenal little talk that she does

402
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:40,988
where she actually can teach a

403
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:42,279
kindergartner to threat model you can

404
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:43,809
teach a kindergarten to threat model I'm

405
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,689
positive you can teach a product manager

406
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:48,969
to threat model one of the other big

407
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:53,079
things and this is probably the key is

408
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:55,029
making sure that the product owner truly

409
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,519
owns the risk and owns the risk a

410
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:59,529
separate acceptance now part of that

411
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,989
means that you're going to occasionally

412
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:04,329
have to be like because they're gonna

413
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:05,829
make a decision that you don't like but

414
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:08,108
in exchange for that they're gonna start

415
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:10,540
making more decisions you do like and

416
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:14,079
they're gonna make decisions without you

417
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,299
even needing to be there we want to push

418
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,679
down to our employees that everybody in

419
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:20,110
the company is responsible for

420
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:23,049
protecting data and when you really

421
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:26,110
instill upon them this idea that data is

422
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:27,040
an actual human it resonates in a way

423
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,980
that I don't think we've communicated

424
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,610
before if I can explain to you how

425
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:37,059
losing your laptop or you know not using

426
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:40,869
2fa etc impacts an actual human being

427
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:42,549
you change behavior probably though you

428
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:44,410
know if you want to take anything else

429
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:47,499
away from this is that every single

430
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,459
person must be held accountable and this

431
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:51,699
is actually one of the great things that

432
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:55,569
security can do when security works well

433
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:56,649
is helping a company understand and

434
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:59,289
manage risk

435
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,929
I did not say mitigate I did not say

436
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:04,179
prevent the idea is that we actually

437
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:08,049
want to help them see what their risk

438
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:10,730
budget is so they can ideally make the

439
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:13,520
right choices automatically

440
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,400
I don't want to scare anybody security

441
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,260
is not going away

442
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,490
the people who own those security

443
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:24,290
operations though are going to change

444
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,089
now this is gonna freak you out because

445
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,619
we know that humans are human and

446
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,480
they're going to make mistakes and

447
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:30,889
probably one of the very first things

448
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,410
that pops up is like oh my god

449
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,210
what if something goes wrong I can put

450
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,040
you at ease for your question I already

451
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,540
know the answer to this question what if

452
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,418
something goes wrong yeah it's

453
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,639
definitely to go wrong people are

454
00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:45,590
definitely going to make mistakes they

455
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,630
are going to do things in ways that you

456
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,520
do not like they're gonna use products

457
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,679
you don't like I am very opinionated

458
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,210
about security products the product

459
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,669
people are going to choose security

460
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,540
products that I hate but if it gets the

461
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:58,820
job done

462
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:02,540
then I need to be comfortable with that

463
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,850
outcome one of the things that I

464
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,730
evacuate Syrian so is the opposite I've

465
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:10,730
actually found more pleasant surprises

466
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:14,480
by pushing security back out into the

467
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:17,049
company as opposed to nightmares people

468
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,720
become much more engaged excited

469
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:22,520
developers in particular want to do the

470
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,169
right thing that you want to write great

471
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,270
secure code and now that kept

472
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,860
opportunity to by the security team

473
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,660
saying like hey security is your

474
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,270
responsibility to the product team

475
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,059
developers are now empowered to tell

476
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:37,340
their managers their product managers

477
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:39,230
etc well time out I have to make sure

478
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,699
this is secured in the same way that the

479
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,950
developer fills in power to say no

480
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,590
there's a bug in this code and the

481
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,240
feature doesn't work they can't and will

482
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,780
push back because we've actually pushed

483
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,700
that power back into them some tricks

484
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:56,629
though is to figure out ways to help

485
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,309
teams fail quickly and if they're going

486
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,530
to make security mistakes ideally make

487
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:02,480
small security mistakes and that's by

488
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,428
saying like hey you know just try this

489
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,340
out we'll be along for the ride with you

490
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:10,610
etc help you know you've been engaged in

491
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,379
that process along with them I think

492
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,689
something people also forget a lot is

493
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,370
that security teams do you make mistakes

494
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,240
they make mistakes a lot how many people

495
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,250
here have ever actually brought down

496
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,390
production as a security person by

497
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:24,550
scanning 10 testing etc

498
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,470
I see some people here that I know

499
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,310
should be raising their hands that's

500
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,020
fine

501
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:33,550
this isn't hackers anonymous it's fine

502
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,050
middle but it's like we should also be

503
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:39,550
comfortable with the product teams

504
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:41,139
making some of those same mistakes you

505
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,520
don't want to give them everything at

506
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,050
once right you know it's like it's this

507
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,980
idea of like Lego blocks you want to

508
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,120
give them maybe some of the bigger

509
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,560
blocks you don't want to give them the

510
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,360
things that they can choke on etc you

511
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:53,050
want to give them chances to actually

512
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,699
ramp up give them the tools and support

513
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,520
those so that when they do make mistakes

514
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:01,480
the impact of that mistake it's just

515
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,740
minimal I just realized I'm pretty sure

516
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,380
everyone in this room is a security

517
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:09,610
professional and I'm kind of lobbying to

518
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,370
get rid of your job that's ok look not

519
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,479
actually the point of my talk though but

520
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,860
it is one of things that people key I

521
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,540
think hold on to you may even wonder

522
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,449
reasonable we've held on to these these

523
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,710
red Legos is because we think that's the

524
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,640
thing that defines us that's what keeps

525
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:27,310
us employed etc there's still a ton of

526
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,770
work to do the things I'm advocating for

527
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:32,290
pushing down are the things that are

528
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:34,629
best handled by the development teams

529
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,399
etc I would argue that the things that

530
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:39,670
the security team is best positioned to

531
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,500
do and are the most impactful for our

532
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:45,340
different set of skills and actually the

533
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,900
skills that we really enjoy so this idea

534
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,429
of actually consulting with teams and

535
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,630
I'm like hey let's sit down and talk

536
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,240
with your design you don't have to

537
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,340
listen to me if you want my help I'm

538
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,870
happy to you know sit down look through

539
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,399
the design talked about the product

540
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,709
features you're about to make etcetera

541
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,210
and just say hey this is maybe one of

542
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,160
the risk and some trade-offs you might

543
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,770
wanna consider oh you identified this

544
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,360
risk yourself here's some of the things

545
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:09,100
I think of when I think I keep

546
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,919
mitigating those things you get to be

547
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,510
creative and actually build again this

548
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,280
idea of security is kind of being that

549
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,740
lens for the rest of the company to

550
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,110
really understand risk and actually see

551
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,760
the entire ecosystem so a product team

552
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,649
can think about their individual risk

553
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,690
but they may not be aware of all the

554
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,160
other teams that are involved in some

555
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,320
decisions they make and security is a

556
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,640
good area to actually kind of focus at

557
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,189
in

558
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,450
but I think probably one of the things

559
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,799
that security could be a little more

560
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,510
powerful at and should work a little bit

561
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:41,110
more at its culture building culture

562
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:43,390
scales if we can convince other people

563
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:47,559
to care about security to care about

564
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:51,130
privacy to care about the humans at the

565
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:53,139
end of the bits and bytes our job is

566
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,400
almost one that's like--you one of the

567
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,770
more powerful thinking I could do as

568
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,799
security game is educate your users and

569
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:06,040
to encourage them to be excited about

570
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:07,960
security by pushing a lot of the JIRA

571
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,520
tickets and the approvals and interviews

572
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,200
off you can also get back that you're

573
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,418
doing real security work you can do deep

574
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,390
research now you can specialize on some

575
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:18,190
really really complex problems one of

576
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,870
the things that was really exciting for

577
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,210
people in the square security team

578
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:25,299
because the gachy spent most of their

579
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,860
time writing code how do you get the

580
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:29,320
right code anymore how many I could get

581
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,049
to do beat reversing how many you

582
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,820
actually get to do what you signed up

583
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:39,129
for when you were just a little baby

584
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:43,330
hacker going back to this idea of

585
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:45,580
security being the lens around like risk

586
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,559
etc we still need to you know help

587
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,270
Shepherd vulnerabilities it's not your

588
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,780
job to fix stuffs not your job to patch

589
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:55,179
but it is your job to help people stay

590
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,309
on top of their phones and then of

591
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:58,090
course the thing that we are

592
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:59,290
unfortunately I guess really good at is

593
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,629
actually handling incidents in doing in

594
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:04,059
forensics I personally think incidents

595
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:07,299
can be fun I don't want any but they can

596
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:09,428
be interesting so this idea of having a

597
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:11,710
team that a city providing that lends

598
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:14,169
and creating like holistic risk

599
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,700
visibility it's like yeah you get to

600
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:18,100
think about and search for those like

601
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:21,040
really really deep nuanced security

602
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,809
issues you can also help the company

603
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,600
understand what exactly conflicts of

604
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:27,280
risk decisions so maybe the marketing

605
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,449
team wants to put something on the

606
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,730
website and they feel like they're

607
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,230
empowered to do so and they should but

608
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,750
one of the product teams who wants to

609
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:36,220
alter how cookies work inside of the

610
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,450
ecosystem and it connects to be a

611
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,760
conflict that the marketing team would

612
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,320
not know about and the product team may

613
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,270
not know about and that's actually a

614
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,260
great thing that security can provide

615
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,530
this whole whole

616
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:50,920
lenz of the entire risk in the ecosystem

617
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:53,740
I'm also interpreting the threatened

618
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:57,040
landscape for people your normal

619
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,690
coworker probably is not looking at

620
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,950
every single zero day that's been

621
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,410
released or not reading all the same

622
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,940
papers that we are they don't understand

623
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,770
speculative execution they just heard it

624
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,210
on the news and it's kind of our job to

625
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,350
interpret those people and help them

626
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,090
understand how does this impact the

627
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,100
company how does it impact your team

628
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:15,129
what should you be prioritizing and

629
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,780
where she do prioritize and then finally

630
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:18,370
probably the hardest problem in computer

631
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,320
science is actually finding out where

632
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,090
everything is this idea of cataloging

633
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,620
things it's also fundamental to the

634
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:27,189
security and it helps us do our job

635
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,770
better when we think about education and

636
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:32,020
this role of security is almost like a

637
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:33,580
missionary slash evangelist it's like

638
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,129
yeah you want to provide role specific

639
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,899
role specific security training to

640
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:39,400
people I've fallen through this book or

641
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,530
just given people just you know oh

642
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,330
here's your generic but wash top ten

643
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,990
security training yep you're a firmware

644
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,840
engineer

645
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:49,900
I'm never gonna care about this but you

646
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,970
have to take it that's how you lose

647
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,560
insecurity it's by giving just generic

648
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,940
security training but role specific

649
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,450
trainings actually really engaging and

650
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:00,370
developers love it and they want it all

651
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,070
the time every developer wants to be a

652
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:05,350
better engineer something I don't see

653
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:09,070
enough of is teaching people about

654
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:10,990
privacy you know for me that's actually

655
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,040
deeply personal I want more and more

656
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,290
people that if you think more about

657
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,730
their privacy and I think if we do and

658
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,790
educate the rest of our company

659
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:20,680
companies will make better decisions so

660
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,690
that people will actually start using

661
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,540
our products as opposed to fighting our

662
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,610
products I think yet another internet

663
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:30,639
statistic it's like one out of ten

664
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:33,189
registrations is a fake email address

665
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,450
because people worry about spam so

666
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,950
they're no longer actually getting a

667
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,420
they're no longer active getting the

668
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,710
full value of your service and you're

669
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,540
also not getting the full value of that

670
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,950
relationship if we can actually get

671
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,659
companies think more about privacy

672
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:47,140
though we can actually bring more people

673
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,310
to our platforms everybody needs to

674
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,410
learn about social engineering including

675
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:52,210
security people like my favorite thing

676
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:53,530
is when I hear security people brag

677
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,150
about how great they are at social

678
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:56,680
engineering and then find out they can't

679
00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:02,620
get people inside their company

680
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:06,400
dapat phones it's again hmm just an

681
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,870
opinion if you also want to get people

682
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,490
highly engaged and you can actually do

683
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,830
this with every person in your company

684
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,900
teach them how to hack teach them the

685
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:16,750
same things that we learn every single

686
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:19,570
person in here was a noob at one point

687
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,160
every single person here started from

688
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:24,100
zero and what that means is that every

689
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:27,040
single person out there can also learn

690
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:29,379
the things that we do probably one of

691
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,629
the more controversial things is telling

692
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,550
people decided pragmatic risk yep

693
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,080
there's just gonna be some things you're

694
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,110
gonna live with it's gonna make you feel

695
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,929
bad hopefully it makes you feel bad but

696
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,629
we know that you can't fix and solve

697
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:47,050
everything at once you can't address

698
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:51,550
every single risk and also taking risk

699
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:53,290
is what allows companies to grow if we

700
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:55,659
did not take the risk of saying hey

701
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,430
let's allow somebody to take a credit

702
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,510
card on the internet we wouldn't have

703
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,070
them in Jordan companies we have here

704
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,590
that sounds like a crazy idea we think

705
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,939
about it back like back in my day you

706
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,120
know back in the 90s and things like

707
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,380
that

708
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,810
putting your Craig on and it was scary

709
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,870
but that risk allowed other companies to

710
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:12,790
flourish if you really want to have fun

711
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,979
and get people engaged do a tabletop

712
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,659
exercise everybody likes a DND they just

713
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,460
don't know they like dandy when you

714
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,950
introduce them the table tops they get

715
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:23,200
it super excited even people that I

716
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,240
would never have expected so we have to

717
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,960
did a tabletop exercise with one of our

718
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:31,060
chief people officer and she can't stop

719
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,370
ranting about it like how awesome it was

720
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,720
and how exciting was etcetera they want

721
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:39,219
to be engaged we just have to actually

722
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:42,910
go to them and engage them shepherding

723
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:44,380
bones the bones seem to tend to wander

724
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,760
they will stay out in the pasture and

725
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,250
graze for much longer than we'd ever

726
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,960
actually like but one of the things that

727
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,870
security team can also do is part of the

728
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,240
reason why they oftentimes don't get

729
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:56,649
patched is that the teams aren't getting

730
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,210
them properly prioritized and we don't

731
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,500
help them understand okay what are the

732
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,570
things you should be fixing right now

733
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,300
and they just stopped just in just pure

734
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:06,280
bone overload I'm sure there's actually

735
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,690
some scanning vendors out here I used to

736
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,160
be one of those horrible vendors as well

737
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,940
you know you still work at four to five

738
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,220
giving

739
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,049
like tons and tons of results and it

740
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,730
turns out you can overwhelm somebody

741
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:17,168
with that but the security team connect

742
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,399
yourself there and there's a key one the

743
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:20,110
key things you understand what the

744
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,758
results actually mean and what that

745
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:25,539
impact is when you work along from the

746
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,490
other team hold teams accountable

747
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:29,408
holding somebody accountable does not

748
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,960
mean that you're going up and yelling at

749
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:33,820
them one of my favorite things to do is

750
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,919
to just publish it everybody in the

751
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,600
company gets to see who's meeting their

752
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,580
SLA is who's not meeting their SLA it's

753
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,860
who are there really really good actors

754
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,870
inside the company and it turns out that

755
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,570
sunlight is a great disinfectant and

756
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:50,168
when you make things visible people

757
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:52,509
change their behavior identifying

758
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,980
patterns that Vons really being said

759
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:55,809
like hey wait a second it turns out this

760
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,820
team here has a lot of cross-site

761
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:59,350
scripting this other team here also has

762
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,850
cross-site scripting okay

763
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:02,469
that's the pattern inside our company

764
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,240
it's like you figure out a true systemic

765
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,850
fix how do we actually resolve this

766
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,590
issue

767
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:12,070
remembering to right-size the Vaughn

768
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:14,740
management process for each team how an

769
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:19,360
infrastructure / DevOps team wants to

770
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:21,009
patch 200 servers is different than what

771
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:25,600
a developer wants to do when it's just

772
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:27,070
submitting one code one line of code we

773
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,070
still get to pin tests with stone it

774
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:32,649
actually go out and hunt we thankfully

775
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,389
in this model get more time to think

776
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:36,459
about these things to go out and

777
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:38,620
actually look for those deep nuanced

778
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,590
bugs and vulnerabilities that may be

779
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,330
residing inside of our infrastructure

780
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,039
the other is that you get to recognize

781
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,809
and look for some of those like just bad

782
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,009
patterns what I call it you know quote

783
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:50,009
unquote code smells

784
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:55,750
we're often called upon to actually you

785
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:57,129
know Don the hazmat suits I think it's

786
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,809
actually a great thing for a security

787
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,309
team to do it is a skill that most of us

788
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:02,200
already have learned you get into

789
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:04,059
introduced to it actually pretty early

790
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,580
and so it's something you can actually

791
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:08,918
help other teams learn helped them

792
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:11,830
become better incident responders and

793
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:14,169
even assist with non security incidents

794
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,850
for better or worse we deal with this

795
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:17,379
maybe a little bit more often some other

796
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,658
people inside the organization and we

797
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:22,330
can assist them that helps level up the

798
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:23,500
entire company and they start to see

799
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,780
security

800
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,000
as they team they want to run to for

801
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:33,280
help as opposed to the team they want to

802
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,110
avoid so they can ship Legos have these

803
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,360
really really small tiny pieces that

804
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,729
like these one singular piece Legos are

805
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,530
only meant for like you know people

806
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,730
three years old or above there's a lot

807
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,430
of stuff that we still have to stay on

808
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,660
top of because yeah you can choke on

809
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,950
Legos if you don't like you're doing you

810
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,050
put them into the wrong hands etc you

811
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,430
got to be a little bit a little bit

812
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,200
smart about how you actually roll some

813
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,120
of these things out some of my favorite

814
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,140
things that can help people avoid with

815
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,790
that is this idea of like hey you

816
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,740
flagged sensitive security operations

817
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,500
this thing you're working on looks like

818
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:04,030
it's critical to the company's security

819
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,960
you know we can actually just have a get

820
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,460
hook or something like that

821
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,720
that actually sends an alert it's like

822
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,800
hey security wants to talk to you

823
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,660
because we think you might be doing

824
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,419
something that is a little bit scary

825
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,980
help people also monitor but ideally not

826
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,900
only just monitor their vulnerable

827
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,660
dependencies help your Mac you Auto

828
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,670
patch the biggest thing that you should

829
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,320
be doing though in the security team

830
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:25,150
it's just shift more you should be

831
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,600
riding today you should be building if

832
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,370
you do not see yourself as a builder

833
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,340
come talk to me I want to change your

834
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:35,260
mind

835
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:38,980
creating gold and past making the right

836
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:41,590
thing easy and the obvious answer is the

837
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:46,240
way we win the way we scale and not only

838
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:48,669
that it accelerates teams one of the

839
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,000
favorite experiences that I have at

840
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:53,980
gussto is teams asking me to hire more

841
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,810
security people Sonic eight I want to

842
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,370
work on features can you hire some more

843
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,500
security people so they can help me

844
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:00,850
build these things it's just a

845
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,250
phenomenal experience and completely

846
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,540
different than what you see in quote

847
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,930
unquote traditional companies or

848
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:09,659
traditional security teams helping

849
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:13,960
infrastructure teams or teams in general

850
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:15,640
define and ideally codify known goods if

851
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,430
you know what known good is you can

852
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,480
always detect any deviation something

853
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,430
that's different than good doesn't mean

854
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,410
it's bad but it's not what we set out to

855
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:26,830
do and even I start doing things like

856
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:30,460
Auto remediation around that this idea

857
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:32,290
of also making it much more difficult

858
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,750
for people to shoot themselves in the

859
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:36,370
foot when it comes to sensitive data so

860
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,230
building PII service

861
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:41,110
tokenization serves as crypto services

862
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:43,030
etc so that you have these strong fences

863
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,919
and that people aren't afraid to

864
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:49,030
experiment because they know now they

865
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,410
kind of have these guardrails if you

866
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,430
don't want to worry about or don't want

867
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,280
to wear with the small block you can

868
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,330
always just give your team Duplo blocks

869
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,290
make some of those things that move more

870
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:00,879
complex a little bit more friendly

871
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:03,879
easier for them to consume and they

872
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,900
don't need the same level of security

873
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,850
knowledge we should be putting ourselves

874
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,350
out of a job

875
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:15,070
build robots automate automate automate

876
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:17,350
automate automate anything that you can

877
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,830
do that seems like taking you out of a

878
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,809
job

879
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,909
you should be doing that and the more

880
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:24,580
you can make things self-service the

881
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,260
better for you the better for your

882
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,909
co-workers and última actually the

883
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:30,760
better for the customer because you can

884
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:37,270
start pushing quicker and have better

885
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:38,620
security an entire ecosystem so to wrap

886
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:42,370
it up because I've been getting to sign

887
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:44,590
a couple of times really what I Mikey

888
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:46,120
trying to get is for more people to

889
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:48,490
start thinking about their security

890
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,000
organization as a building organization

891
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:55,690
you have security engineer in your title

892
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,730
be an engineer build every single person

893
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:00,480
in this room is capable of writing code

894
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:03,190
if you don't write code you can learn

895
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,780
every person can learn to write code and

896
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,510
it is such a phenomenally powerful thing

897
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:10,029
to do and that is how we truly scale and

898
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:13,210
if we can actually do those things and

899
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:19,560
get it right we have fun and everything

900
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:19,560
is awesome so yeah

901
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,799
I don't do a halftime / what oh I have

902
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,850
six minutes for questions so yeah if

903
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,510
there are any questions

904
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:37,040
I've also welcome heckling oh wow

905
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:39,070
they're not here some here and I

906
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,779
probably should have brought glasses

907
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:43,460
yeah oh this is a key this is good man

908
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,139
you mentioned it's crucial that everyone

909
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,940
should be held accountable on the

910
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:50,120
subject of owning their own risk well

911
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:52,159
what's the material way to do that in

912
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,799
ways actually I like to do that is as

913
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,780
boring as it sounds risk registers and

914
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,190
just publishing those top risks to the

915
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,820
company and the risk that we're still

916
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:05,390
carrying and which team's own those risk

917
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:08,180
it's amazing how quick people will make

918
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:10,220
different choices once they know that

919
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,200
all of the execs are going to see the

920
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,799
decision that they made that changes

921
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,419
behavior immediately when execs see that

922
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,510
oh this is also gonna be presented to

923
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:23,380
the board immediate behavioral change

924
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:26,420
sunlight is the best disinfectant

925
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:28,100
another question who do judges typically

926
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,960
say it's responsible accountable for

927
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,810
information security and a breached

928
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,210
company they generally always hold the

929
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:37,630
executives accountable but it's a C so

930
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,630
that gets fired

931
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:41,630
every single time and this has happened

932
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,520
to friends among where I know they were

933
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:46,670
literally doing the right thing and I

934
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,940
know that they were advocating for the

935
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:53,540
right behavior and there's a reason why

936
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:56,510
the gallows humor for CSO is cheap chief

937
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,380
scapegoat officer yeah we're kind of

938
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,670
like the first ones to get thrown

939
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:02,320
underneath the bus or the sacrificial

940
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:06,980
lamb but it's still an enjoyable job

941
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,150
that is the whoops another question

942
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:10,910
popped up

943
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:12,950
how do you maintain publish all risk and

944
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:15,290
asila breaks without building a culture

945
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:20,450
of shaming debs that's like a really

946
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:23,210
good question it's just data and and and

947
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:24,649
I am maybe you know I don't here adhere

948
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,600
to the guidance as well I can

949
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:28,460
occasionally be an ass and it's like the

950
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,589
data is the data if you want to change

951
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,830
the data to change your behavior if you

952
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:35,660
are unhappy with having other people

953
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,730
know that you're not living up to your

954
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,569
obligations

955
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,570
live up to your obligation

956
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:44,670
suppose the owner of a small feature

957
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:46,230
accepts the risk but a breach blows up

958
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,050
the reputation the whole company or

959
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:51,450
crease a path to a larger breach that's

960
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,980
a risk that we take every day

961
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,919
I don't not actually solve that problem

962
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,540
I do know that if we empower people more

963
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,010
and build more golden past we can

964
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,610
actually reduce the likelihood of that

965
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:04,380
happening by us being so involved in

966
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:06,390
some of the bureaucracy we don't have

967
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,210
the time and the resources to actually

968
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:11,040
build the tools to minimize impact and

969
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:16,890
risk and so I believe that it is time

970
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:19,110
and yeah work with gusto I don't have

971
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:20,160
the little bracelet on but I will be

972
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,600
down in the hall if you have any other

973
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,009
questions and particularly have a

974
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,259
question about come and get a job at

975
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,880
gusto more than half a key field those

976
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:29,310
as well thank all of you for actually

977
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,860
coming out here yeah and hope you have a

978
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:36,399
great day

979
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:36,399
[Applause]
