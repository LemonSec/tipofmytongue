1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
want to introduce today's keynote

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,480
speaker speaking on what's new or not in

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,490
2020 are we making progress on the

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,210
intractable security problems we have

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,030
Larkin Ryder

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:22,590
she's the interim CEO at slack and here

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:29,689
you go oh all right let's move off the

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,689
big picture of my face oh okay Oh

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,379
yeah all right I'm gonna go ahead and

10
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:59,019
start in the interest of time because

11
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,580
the first few slides are mildly amusing

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,610
but really I can just stand here and

13
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,110
talk and and that'll be great so I am

14
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,340
excited to be here talking about the

15
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,050
next big thing but I'm going to talk

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,210
about the last 10 years of big things

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,370
instead in my presentation so we're all

18
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,679
grounded in our history something I know

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,450
I need to take more time to do speaking

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,290
of my history yes I am currently the

21
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,729
acting chief security officer at slack

22
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,450
and nobody's more surprised about that

23
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,450
than I am

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,210
right so how did that happen well I have

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,309
to blame in part these two well these

26
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,070
two gentlemen right here in 2004 my

27
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,650
manager decided to flee back to France

28
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,570
for an extended vacation at the end of

29
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,630
the year while we were completing our

30
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,190
survey Knox Lee audit and there was just

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,170
one thing left to do and that was to

32
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,880
secure the databases with the financial

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,909
statements in them of financial records

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,070
no problem right that's that's the core

35
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:56,380
of what you do for Sox and of course I

36
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:59,020
had zero experience at that time either

37
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,970
in security or databases so I was the

38
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,630
perfect person to take on this task in a

39
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,700
very small company I didn't mess that up

40
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,859
too badly it turns out so they let me

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:14,019
take a crack at messing with a network

42
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,820
as part of PCI DSS great wonderful you

43
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:20,440
can feel free to take my slides wherever

44
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:21,790
you want to if you need to move them and

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,670
if I have to work without my speaker

46
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,400
notes it's it's whatever I found of mine

47
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,379
I'll just make something out that's fine

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:34,269
that's what I was gonna do anyway

49
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:37,370
so that went okay and that led me on to

50
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:40,069
working in the enterprise security team

51
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,540
at Twitter and then working at slack as

52
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:43,250
the director of risk and compliance and

53
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,049
then director of product security and

54
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,790
apparently the natural progression from

55
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,900
doing all that is to be the acting chief

56
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,900
security officer great

57
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,200
okay let's get back to where we were all

58
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,859
right and then here we are at b-sides

59
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,988
booth celebrating our tenth anniversary

60
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,250
exactly if this is actually I'm so

61
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,500
excited to be here because this is

62
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,239
actually my favorite conference that I

63
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,519
go to of all the security conferences

64
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,500
that I have been to so far I haven't

65
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,870
found what I like more than b-sides it's

66
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,030
local I don't have to travel it's the

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,379
right size and I get to see a bunch of

68
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,420
people who I look forward to seeing

69
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:31,879
every time I can't walk down the hall

70
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,679
without collecting like ten hugs all

71
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,920
right so what have we done in the last

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,790
ten years to bring us here what have we

73
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,980
accomplished well to have that

74
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,030
conversation I want to have that

75
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,670
conversation but first I'm going to

76
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,049
treat you all to a little story so my

77
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,790
husband and I a little while ago we're

78
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:48,200
looking at combining some investment

79
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,720
accounts right so we had to get on the

80
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,220
phone with the agent who had the

81
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,840
separate account they were all in one

82
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,280
company but separate accounts we wanted

83
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,930
to bring them together the agent is like

84
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,120
okay let me ask you some identity

85
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,280
information so the agent is collecting

86
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,989
like your name your birthday or social

87
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,849
security number etcetera and that miss

88
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:07,310
Ryder I have one last security question

89
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:09,578
for you can you please tell me what is

90
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:13,730
the name of the street you grew up on

91
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:14,630
okay I you know typey typey look it up

92
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:20,839
all right all right

93
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:24,560
Capital D % open question mark smiley

94
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:26,090
face and lowercase P uppercase number

95
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,770
one you know whatever I had a long

96
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,450
string and I read it off and that was

97
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,729
that was the answer to that question and

98
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,430
then thank you miss Ryder that's correct

99
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:37,130
mr. Ryder can I ask you please tell me

100
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,289
the name of your first pet and my

101
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,210
husband his eyes get a little wide and

102
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:44,659
then his shoulders just start shaking

103
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:46,669
with laughter and he says Rover and that

104
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,580
is what it's like in my house all right

105
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:51,349
so talking about the attend the events

106
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,270
of the last ten years that shaped our

107
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:55,610
perception I'm gonna talk a little bit

108
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,130
about some fun malware some great data

109
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,020
breaches and some awesome

110
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,340
vulnerabilities starting right away with

111
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,020
malware remember when I thought about

112
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,750
malware when I first started out in my

113
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,789
security career my perception was that

114
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,289
ruins somebody's day you know that's too

115
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:11,659
bad that happened to that other person

116
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:13,610
over there on their one computer and

117
00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:15,530
nobody else is impacted and that's

118
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,169
annoying but I didn't really think of it

119
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,309
as anything that was particularly

120
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:21,890
earth-shattering world-changing

121
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,229
important all right well let's jump into

122
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,330
2010 okay because that's when Stuxnet

123
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:28,070
really became something that we were

124
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,080
allowed to become aware of and this is a

125
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:33,020
really interesting story so we're maybe

126
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,150
talking about 20 million dollars in

127
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,030
centrifuges that were damaged by Stuxnet

128
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:40,489
but really the implications defy math

129
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,770
here right this is for those of you who

130
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,900
don't know the malware that was

131
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,630
introduced to the uranium enrichment

132
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,510
facility in Natanz so this had the

133
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:53,690
purpose of disrupting the the Iranian

134
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:57,409
ability to enrich uranium it was a

135
00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:00,409
program that was started by the US

136
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,909
government and it's it's fascinating how

137
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:03,560
it progressed if you haven't read Kim's

138
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:05,150
letters countdown to zero daybook I

139
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,760
really recommend it it's a it's an

140
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,650
amazing read I can't wait to see who's

141
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,039
in the movie all right and then wanna

142
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:15,770
cry of course landed many years later

143
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,159
this was one of the most dominant pieces

144
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:22,099
of ransomware for billion dollars were

145
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:23,599
impacted across 150 countries and then

146
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,680
not Pecha was really fun not really

147
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:28,729
ransomware this ostensibly was the the

148
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,610
Russian government trying to destabilize

149
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,469
Ukraine I think something like around 70

150
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,020
percent of the infections where we're in

151
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:38,029
that one geographic location right so

152
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,039
this again like Stuxnet was very

153
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:41,510
targeted I think the introduction point

154
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:43,159
was some document that was widely used

155
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,560
for filing taxes in the Ukraine or

156
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:47,270
something so of course with all malware

157
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,400
it wasn't just you contained to the

158
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,380
Ukraine I bet some of these other US

159
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,210
companies global companies that were

160
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,680
impacted maybe they had to file taxes in

161
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,799
the Ukraine and they were impacted as

162
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,380
well alright so talking about data

163
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,480
breaches here's a list of data breaches

164
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,690
it's a small list compared to the actual

165
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,750
number of daily briefing list it really

166
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,550
focuses on some of the larger breeches

167
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,100
they would look larger if Yahoo didn't

168
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,020
look so big sorry about that Yahoo it's

169
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,450
just how things are when you have three

170
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,219
billion is your your winning number

171
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:22,010
but Yahoo is is one of my favorite

172
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,630
breeches as well because there you know

173
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,310
there are great records that I've seen

174
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,680
I've seen great presentations about the

175
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,030
Yahoo breach and understanding that this

176
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,790
is a case where we got from

177
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,650
identification you know all the way

178
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,480
through prosecution to conviction for

179
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,609
the people who are responsible like yeah

180
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,340
I hope that's something that we can do

181
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,900
more of if we work harder on our

182
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,909
attribution capabilities in this case

183
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,190
names email addresses telephone numbers

184
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,830
birthday it's passwords and security

185
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,719
questions were all impacted so Adult

186
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,460
Friend Finder is a it's possibly a

187
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,080
different motivation this one in Ashley

188
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,560
Madison maybe you know those are

189
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,510
motivated by people who are making a

190
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,900
moral judgment on the users of these

191
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:04,880
sites but again you have some very

192
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,500
private data that's being impacted here

193
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,870
as well in this case plain text or

194
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,250
weekly hash passwords were included ok

195
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,940
target takes me all the way back to my

196
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,590
pci-dss roots right so looking at this

197
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,240
particular compromise of these

198
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,679
point-of-sale systems it was one of

199
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,380
those cases where the hackers had to go

200
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,690
in and fix bugs in the point-of-sale

201
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,719
systems that way they were attempting to

202
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,040
corrupt because they had a plan right

203
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,170
they had you know a couple of weeks

204
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,419
before Black Friday to get their malware

205
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,460
in there get it stable get it working

206
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,169
through the holiday season to get the

207
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,120
credit the payment card and debit card

208
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,069
information that they wanted out of that

209
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,929
environment so they made sure that

210
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,420
malware was good they had to of course

211
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:45,949
have access to the server that was

212
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,839
cryptographically signing all the

213
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,850
downloads to the point-of-sale systems

214
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,790
so you know yay for network segmentation

215
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,610
and then they had to have an exfil path

216
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:58,339
and this is where famously a vendor was

217
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,510
involved in the breach as well we can

218
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,370
talk about that in a bit

219
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,960
all right so vulnerabilities earning

220
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,250
names there's so many here you're not

221
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,140
going to see your favorite they're just

222
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,430
too many favorite vulnerabilities but

223
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,990
but heartbleed was the one that really

224
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,459
stuck in my consciousness is one of the

225
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,379
first one a memory leak in the open SSL

226
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:17,349
implementation for the tls heartbeat

227
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:18,999
extension this meant that anything that

228
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,910
you were actually trying to encrypt on

229
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:24,489
open networks was potentially available

230
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:27,368
to someone who had access to that data

231
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:29,709
stream so very scary because you know

232
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:32,079
again payment card data passwords you

233
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,108
know private medical history information

234
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,939
anything could be exposed through this

235
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:38,139
next up were meltdown inspector very

236
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:39,608
interesting because they were at the

237
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:41,139
hardware architecture level and of

238
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:42,309
course if you're working on a in a

239
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:46,839
processing environment where you have

240
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:49,629
shared a hardware stack then you're

241
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,999
worried about processes being able to

242
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:53,679
read the data of each other and then

243
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:54,999
eternal blue okay eternal blue was

244
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,429
actually the vulnerability that was

245
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:59,799
behind want to cry and not Petya this

246
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:02,249
was a mishandled SMB protocol packet

247
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:04,749
that allowed malicious code execution

248
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:06,459
and this one was interesting because

249
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:08,859
this was known for a long time by the

250
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:11,018
NSA and they chose not to disclose it so

251
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:13,600
that they could capitalize on it it was

252
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:17,949
then eventually disclosed by shadow

253
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,839
brokers all right so how have we been

254
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:21,729
changed by these events well I certainly

255
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,439
just developed an increasing interest in

256
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,079
information security as a result of

257
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:27,699
being aware of all these things but

258
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,479
certainly we have to think about how

259
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:32,709
that perception has changed person you

260
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,419
know think about how those events have

261
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:35,949
changed perception more globally so this

262
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:38,949
is a study that was done by the World

263
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:40,779
Economic Forum and it's a global risk

264
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:43,118
perception survey and you'll notice that

265
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:45,610
number five and number eight on this

266
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:47,220
list are cyber attacks so this is the

267
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,980
list of things that they think will

268
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:54,850
increase and be impactful in the next

269
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,860
decade I think part of that perception

270
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,389
has to be defined by the media so one

271
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,949
thing I've noticed as I read the paper

272
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:01,569
every day and I do and that's the

273
00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:04,118
sidewalk in front of my house where the

274
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:06,219
paper actually in physical form gets

275
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:07,809
delivered every day and these are three

276
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,850
articles that I found related to

277
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:12,850
information security in that were in the

278
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:15,549
paper in one day so I think that

279
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,589
heightened awareness is something that

280
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,660
we're all experiencing but the media is

281
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:23,139
bringing it to into everybody's

282
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,939
consciousness but a lot of other things

283
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:28,300
besides awareness chain

284
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,950
in the last decade things materially

285
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,569
changed in the way we get our job done

286
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,070
and I want to talk about some of the

287
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,230
trends that I think are reshaping

288
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,030
working lives certainly we have to talk

289
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,940
about the cloud certainly we have to

290
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,890
talk about privacy regulation and the

291
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,840
ubiquity of mobile devices that I see

292
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:46,180
literally right now pointing at me from

293
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,230
around this audience so talking first

294
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:52,660
about cloud so when I first started in

295
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,730
computer science my my first job out of

296
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,069
college was testing network equipment

297
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,870
for Hewlett Packard so I quickly learned

298
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,970
that I did not wear nice clothes for

299
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,680
that job because what you were going to

300
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,360
be doing is there was this little mini

301
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,739
data that desks all around the perimeter

302
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,450
and then in the center of the building

303
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,310
is the data center where you go in there

304
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,960
and you actually are installing these

305
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,369
network devices and you're pulling up

306
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,560
the floor tiles and you're running the

307
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,380
cables because that's how networks were

308
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,589
built they were actually built in those

309
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,510
days that was that is not what we're

310
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,280
doing right now right we have switched

311
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,040
completely to virtualized environment

312
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,260
and software-defined networking is what

313
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,599
we use every day and of course the most

314
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,400
important device in that environment was

315
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,610
the firewall that we were using to

316
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,410
protect it but now our perimeter is

317
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,620
really identity security of some

318
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,180
combination of your your human users and

319
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,030
the passwords they use and hopefully

320
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,069
two-factor and probably you know their

321
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,230
devices is our trust anchor and their

322
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,300
email or trust anchor for making sure

323
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,700
all that is working the way you want it

324
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,560
to work as a security professional and

325
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,870
then finally that perimeter because now

326
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,270
it's nice and virtualized is evolving at

327
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,370
an incredible rate you can sign up for a

328
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:08,740
new service faster than I can run that

329
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:10,180
cable under that floor for sure now one

330
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,980
of the things that really helps that and

331
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,319
I work at slack which is definitely part

332
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,090
of this problem I realize that is I put

333
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,250
this slide up here with someone else's

334
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:20,500
company is that we have both free and

335
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,830
paid tiers that are available to your

336
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,780
users so your users are you know having

337
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,460
a great time you know going and finding

338
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,079
whatever it is they need and then

339
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,060
clicking the accept button on those

340
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,860
terms of service and then uploading your

341
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,400
company's private data there whether

342
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,910
they're really authorized to agree to

343
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,560
those terms of service on behalf

344
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,380
your company that might be something

345
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,439
that you want to remind them about and

346
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,720
of course then you have all of that data

347
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,540
ending up in the private cloud right on

348
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,000
that in that in the in the cloud so

349
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,530
you're probably as a security

350
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,600
professional thinking oh what can I do

351
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:58,339
to make sure I'm tracking all the data

352
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,140
that's ending up in that you're probably

353
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,210
thinking about more cloud services that

354
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,920
you're gonna buy to help you track that

355
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,450
data that's ending up in the cloud or

356
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,219
you know maybe you actually have a

357
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,750
controlled networking environment and a

358
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,960
cosby and you want to go old-school with

359
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:14,750
that but again what you're doing is

360
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,620
you're bringing more vendors into the

361
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:20,750
equation and this puts more I'm over you

362
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,370
know vendor vendor risk management

363
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,020
vendor security review was definitely

364
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,000
something that I thought about in 2010

365
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,439
but now it's just like this is like I

366
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,650
need more people for that we need a

367
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,050
better solution as a community for how

368
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,480
we establish trust with all the vendors

369
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,490
that we rely on and that is important

370
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,760
because every vendor that is on this

371
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:43,010
screen here was material in a breach a

372
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,300
significant breach probably one of the

373
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,700
ones on the list

374
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,160
Fazio was the mechanical service that

375
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,200
controlled the HVAC system that was the

376
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:56,089
exfil vector for the target

377
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:57,410
point-of-sale malware all right and of

378
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,840
course vector and meltdown

379
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,060
so we already which we already talked

380
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,280
about right but we're all hosting data

381
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,109
on these shared services so so our

382
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,910
hosting environment it was also a cloud

383
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,030
environment it's also a virtualized

384
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:13,189
environment so you know basically every

385
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,650
one of my customers was like I need to

386
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,090
talk to the C so now when Spector and

387
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,620
meltdown became a thing because they

388
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,910
wanted to know that their private data

389
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:26,090
in my AWS environment was being

390
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:28,160
protected from specter and meltdown all

391
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,660
right so one of the good things that I

392
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,829
think has happened because you can't

393
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,180
just spend all our time talking about

394
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,730
the bad things that have happened is

395
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,829
privacy the privacy regulation that has

396
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:40,790
come forward in the last 10 years has

397
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:44,750
been certainly significant we have two

398
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:47,120
things that are of importance mostly in

399
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,130
the EU we have GD P R and then here in

400
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,170
California we have C CPA so that's the

401
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,720
general data

402
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,599
tection regulation and the California

403
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,360
consumer Privacy Act both of those give

404
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,029
some protections on these areas right it

405
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,649
makes sure that you as a user have

406
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:04,870
permission or are granting permission

407
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:08,110
both for the processing and in some

408
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,880
cases the selling of your data you can

409
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,440
have your data removed the right to be

410
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,269
forgotten as it's commonly known you

411
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,639
have visibility to the data that's being

412
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:18,310
stored about you you have a requirement

413
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,079
for breach notices you have some data

414
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,699
portability so you don't get locked in

415
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,899
in one particular vendor because they

416
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:25,630
have so much of your data you have the

417
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:27,399
right to remove that information and

418
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,230
then there are monetary penalties

419
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,930
penalties in my favorite one the right

420
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,949
to private action that means for example

421
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:37,779
under CCP a that you as the consumer

422
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:40,630
have a right if you have non-encrypted

423
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,910
non redacted personal information and it

424
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:45,670
is subject to unauthorized access

425
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,730
exfiltration disclosure as a result of

426
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,990
the business failing to maintain

427
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,209
security procedures and practices that

428
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:56,050
are appropriate so this is saying that

429
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:58,149
we as cloud service providers as holders

430
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,769
of consumer data have to make sure that

431
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:02,230
we're doing right by the consumer with

432
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:06,400
respect to security or they have the

433
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:08,199
right to come after us appropriately one

434
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,209
the only thing I don't like about all

435
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,189
the privacy regulation is that it does

436
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,720
take resources away from everything else

437
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:15,309
I'm trying to do for security because I

438
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,169
have to rush over to whatever that

439
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:18,579
regulation is I have to you know walk

440
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,079
through that checklist of security

441
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,209
requirements and making sure that I'm

442
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,948
doing all of them and they are vague

443
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,079
they're not prescriptive they're they're

444
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:28,000
very broad I have to like actually talk

445
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,129
to lawyers about how to interpret them

446
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,440
and whether they really map to my system

447
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,030
of controls or not or you know do I have

448
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,070
a gap and what is everyone else doing

449
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,918
and has there been litigation that's

450
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,750
decided what good looks like about you

451
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,760
know what you do with IP addresses for

452
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,320
example I would love it if there were a

453
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,910
more prescriptive standard that everyone

454
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,720
could agree to everyone could align on

455
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:51,070
and you know just go do ISO 27001 and

456
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,070
everybody don't be good something like

457
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:57,100
that all right okay so now let's talk

458
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:59,889
about bring your own device the mobile

459
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,110
devices are ubiquitous and I love mobile

460
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:03,630
devices

461
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:06,689
they are great than easy to use the apps

462
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:08,910
are just downright almost fun even if

463
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,770
their work based you know it's easy

464
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,900
token based access for getting whatever

465
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,940
you want there are notifications coming

466
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,820
to my device all the time everybody

467
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,070
loves me isn't that great and it's but

468
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,169
from my perspective easy to FA right

469
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,580
this is a way for me to put a second

470
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,890
factor of authentication in front of my

471
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,169
entire you know identity protected

472
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,120
perimeter that will actually be usable

473
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,280
for my user so I'm happy about that

474
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,229
and there are biometrics there which I

475
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,080
have mixed feelings about biometrics are

476
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,450
potentially complex from a privacy point

477
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,639
of view but for users who need it if

478
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,260
they need a biometric to authorize

479
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,190
themselves and keep that second factor

480
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,830
or easy enough to use I'll take it

481
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:52,320
but there's the problem of loss right

482
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,090
we've had this problem for a while but

483
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,159
it's really more so with the expection

484
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,629
of there's an expectation of mobility

485
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,780
among our employees right so they have

486
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,400
their mobile devices and they expect to

487
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,760
be able to use them for the work that

488
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,169
they do they're putting data on those

489
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,150
devices they're putting the tokens on

490
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:11,429
those devices that are there potentially

491
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,020
at risk this has increased the use of

492
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:14,669
laptops in my opinion I think the two go

493
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:18,990
hand in hand people just expect to be

494
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:22,140
moving around more and that can create

495
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,910
problems for the company now one is of

496
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,059
course lost it's extremely embarrassing

497
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:29,130
when you know laptops and devices get

498
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:33,120
lost and that exposes the information

499
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:34,679
there certainly for the company I I did

500
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,629
a meaningless study where I collected

501
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,520
five years of data to see you know what

502
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,990
happens to laptops and you know what's

503
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,389
the behavior there yeah cars and bars

504
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,100
pretty much if you're losing a laptop or

505
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,500
personal device it's either gonna be

506
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,600
because you left it in your car or you

507
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,940
took it to a bar and you know I know

508
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,159
everybody does those things just just

509
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,510
letting you know and then there's the

510
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,280
complexity of the fact that you're

511
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,290
putting your company's data on your

512
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,020
personal device whether you're using a

513
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,149
personal laptop or a personal phone how

514
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,470
many people here right now today are

515
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:09,300
carrying two phones for this very reason

516
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,010
okay yeah that's that's about what I

517
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,290
thought right I mean they're like maybe

518
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,340
it's maybe five to ten percent of the

519
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,168
people here have

520
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,510
probably are doing that because they've

521
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:20,039
been through this before and the rest of

522
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,289
you haven't been through this yet so

523
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:24,629
you're not doing it but once you have

524
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:26,908
you will because if your company ever

525
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,309
needs to take your device from you and

526
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:31,620
get a complete image for of it

527
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:33,480
for discovery purposes you are not going

528
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,459
to feel very comfortable about having

529
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:40,169
that ever happen to you a second time

530
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,760
and then malware is increasingly

531
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:44,400
becoming something that we have to worry

532
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,440
about in the mobile device ecosystem

533
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,210
humming bad was installed on 10 million

534
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:53,399
devices this is III won't go into detail

535
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,230
here but that is a that is an Android

536
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:57,899
system malware I think going back to

537
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,130
2016 and there as many as 24,000

538
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:01,110
malicious apps that are being blocked

539
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:03,390
every day so how many are actually being

540
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,428
stalled like it's an incredible

541
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,360
it's an incredible volume and something

542
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:10,289
that I think we don't have a great

543
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,360
handle on all right I am going to give

544
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,129
you another story here hang on I got to

545
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,779
remember it because I don't actually I'm

546
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,950
not actually working from speaker notes

547
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:18,950
up here in case you couldn't tell

548
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,100
this was the one where which one was

549
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,130
this Arkady

550
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,408
do you remember damn it Oh oh yeah I

551
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:32,010
remember so my husband called his credit

552
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:34,049
union he was he needed to close out his

553
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:36,720
account so the agent picks up the phone

554
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:40,620
yes my husband's like yeah I want to

555
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,779
close my account yes there is a charge

556
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,719
for that it's a dollar 95 to close your

557
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:48,480
account and I'll need a credit card from

558
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,570
you and my husband's what you're gonna

559
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,549
charge me to close my account that's

560
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,049
ridiculous and sir if you want your

561
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:56,940
account closed you have to pay the

562
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:00,029
dollar 95 fee but I'm ready to take your

563
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,409
credit card number at any time I my

564
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:03,539
husband's like no I'm not gonna pay you

565
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:05,309
for that and the agent hangs up on him

566
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,990
at which point my husband notices that

567
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:08,700
he has Mis dialed the number for his

568
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:11,640
credit union and whoever he was talking

569
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,620
to was actually not an agent of that

570
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,559
company just some guy who was collecting

571
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,299
credit card numbers and I don't know

572
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,610
probably more than a dollar 95 at a time

573
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:21,639
all right so I don't make predictions

574
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,988
about things

575
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:25,238
if I were to make predictions I'd

576
00:22:22,989 --> 00:22:26,609
probably make these three that we're

577
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:29,139
going to see a lot more

578
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:32,439
internet-of-things participation in

579
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:33,939
virus distribution and botnets I've

580
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,859
heard I you know when I was getting

581
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,089
ready for this presentation and looking

582
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:39,609
around about things one of the things

583
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:41,019
that kept coming up was machine learning

584
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:43,839
because machine learning is all the rage

585
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:45,579
I can't wait to see the battle between

586
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:47,529
the machine learning systems that are

587
00:22:45,579 --> 00:22:48,820
going to introduce them malware and the

588
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:51,339
machine learning systems that are going

589
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,468
to remove the malware I know who I'm

590
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:56,079
rooting for but we'll see

591
00:22:53,469 --> 00:22:57,729
and then the vulnerability of Skadden

592
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,579
infrastructure I think there was a

593
00:22:57,729 --> 00:23:02,769
recent Senate bill that was passed that

594
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:05,019
was going to suggest that maybe more of

595
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:10,299
our critical control systems should be

596
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:11,950
analog and not digital all right so

597
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:13,989
these are the things that have been

598
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,919
changing but how have these changes in

599
00:23:13,989 --> 00:23:17,440
the last 10 years

600
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,479
you know impacted the struggles that we

601
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,859
have with information security well I

602
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:24,190
think we talked a little bit about how

603
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:26,619
the cloud is changing things but I think

604
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,349
there's some things that continue and I

605
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:32,019
want to focus now on kind of the

606
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:33,849
constants the work that continues and I

607
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:36,399
think user behavior continues to matter

608
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:39,879
deeply and I'm going to talk a little

609
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:41,379
bit about detection I kind of have a bee

610
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:43,329
in my bonnet on detection right now I

611
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,859
always have one on user behavior all

612
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:46,539
right so this is what I call the

613
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:48,759
checklist of the impossible this is the

614
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:51,219
list of things that people tell users

615
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:53,019
that they always have to do and I call

616
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:54,879
this the checklist of the impossible

617
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:58,509
because while it is still important for

618
00:23:54,879 --> 00:24:00,879
security it is also a nassima to most of

619
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:02,529
the work that our users are doing right

620
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:04,238
there in the cloud all the time the

621
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:05,979
cloud runs on links those links are

622
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:07,779
going to show up and you know

623
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:10,209
attachments as downloads from those

624
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,799
services all of these are things that I

625
00:24:10,209 --> 00:24:14,859
know most of the people I work with they

626
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:17,168
have to interact with every single day

627
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:19,149
so telling them oh you know how you do

628
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:22,239
your work don't do it that way seems

629
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:24,549
like an impossible ask to me staying

630
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:25,959
patched is something I'd like us to

631
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:27,549
solve those problems I'd like us to

632
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:29,660
figure out how we can make sure things

633
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:32,030
just update seamlessly and automat

634
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,940
and without too much user interruption

635
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:37,610
maybe minimize what level is needed if

636
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,710
that's possible I realized that there's

637
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:42,169
still 1 million machines vulnerable to

638
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,790
eternal blue so this must be a hard

639
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,740
problem for people right they must

640
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,740
really need our support to figure out

641
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,690
how to solve it all right and I know

642
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,730
phishing is still the top thread action

643
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,070
so I know people are still clicking on

644
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,780
links and entering their credentials but

645
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,580
again we have to figure out how to make

646
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:02,690
sure that that's something they can do

647
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,250
safely this this is the second half of

648
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,800
that checklist and this is slightly less

649
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:13,280
impossible right so we can probably

650
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:15,860
avoid USBs USB drives probably VPN is

651
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,389
barely available for us it's I don't

652
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:20,389
know I don't pack up my data it's all

653
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:22,760
just in the cloud right and it's

654
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,800
important to note that the USB that was

655
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,090
the entry point for Stuxnet right so for

656
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,370
those of you who don't know if you're

657
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:31,669
trying to get software into a secret

658
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:34,580
facility in Iran you don't have a lot of

659
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:37,630
network entry points so it is still an

660
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:40,310
interesting and valid vector for attack

661
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,050
but whatever you're trying to do you

662
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,240
probably have a cloud service that will

663
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:47,030
let you do these things you don't have

664
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:51,110
to use USBs to move big files around

665
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:52,940
anymore but if I could simplify it for

666
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,770
the user if I could make it easier for

667
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,080
them if I could say look they're really

668
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,900
these are the only things that you have

669
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,449
to you know if I had to give a new user

670
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,850
onboarding in five minutes this would be

671
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:09,980
the checklist that I would use if you

672
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:13,280
see something say something probably the

673
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,020
only time I was ever directly involved

674
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,180
in a company that was experiencing an

675
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,310
active attacker that was on their

676
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:23,690
network and attempting to exfiltrate

677
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:27,080
data came to light because one database

678
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:31,190
engineer noticed one query on one server

679
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,870
that was running too long on optimized

680
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,510
queries you know on our database tier

681
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:38,209
that shouldn't be happening hey Joe

682
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,440
look there's this on optimize query huh

683
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,670
bill that's odd

684
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,320
let's go tell security and that is

685
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,480
that attack came to light for the

686
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:49,879
security team that day could have gone

687
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:52,320
so much differently for that company I

688
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,390
think this is one of the most important

689
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,250
things we can tell our users all right

690
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:59,130
use what I gave you please don't go up

691
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,420
and sign up for the free tier customer

692
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,010
data is off-limits that's kind of

693
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,390
obvious and if you don't understand why

694
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,830
I'm adding friction for you tell me that

695
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,390
you don't understand cuz I would love to

696
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:09,360
explain it to you I really would

697
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:10,770
my experience is 99.99% of the people

698
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,270
that you work with they just want to do

699
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,490
the right thing and they don't

700
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,620
understand why they they have to choose

701
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,060
between right thing a and right thing B

702
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,719
and you're there to help them

703
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:24,750
rationalize that all right and this is

704
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:29,250
the final thing that I have that I am

705
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:32,580
concerned about detection how much more

706
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:34,590
time do I have left by the way I have 20

707
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,389
minutes Oh awesome okay we can I can

708
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:42,840
really I can really grind this axes when

709
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:47,550
I'm hearing here so let me go back

710
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:50,669
actually to this slide so I was in a

711
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:53,220
room recently with a team of other CISOs

712
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,990
and we were talking about metrics and we

713
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,940
were talking about how hard it is to

714
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,580
define metrics for our industry how do

715
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,920
we meaningfully explain the great job

716
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,810
we're doing as CISOs in building a

717
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:07,070
security program and protecting the

718
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:09,300
sensitive data that is in our care and

719
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,889
it's hard to find a metric that

720
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,450
represents your progress towards

721
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,220
preventing something from happening

722
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,680
which is what you're really trying to do

723
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,860
as a CSO and one of the things that we

724
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:23,400
know is important is our ability to

725
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:25,020
detect when the bad thing happens and so

726
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,090
we were talking about red team and

727
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,280
attacks and you know the time to detect

728
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:32,070
and and how quickly we can we can do

729
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,260
that and is that a valid simulation or

730
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,629
are we kidding ourselves and in kind of

731
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:40,110
the consensus in the room settled down

732
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:42,060
to yeah we're gonna get owned and we're

733
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,100
not going to know it and then we're

734
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,190
gonna get fired and then all the ceases

735
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,570
are gonna stand up and shift right one

736
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,570
company and sit down again

737
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:57,340
like yeah that's probably what's gonna

738
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:59,679
happen but man that's that right like

739
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:02,408
why aren't we gonna know what why can't

740
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,820
we tell we get so much data we know that

741
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:05,229
the most attacked industry is going to

742
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,908
be health care it's gonna be organized

743
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:10,299
crime it's going to be a financial

744
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:12,639
motivation we have a lot of information

745
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:14,200
that we should be relying on about what

746
00:29:12,639 --> 00:29:16,178
the threats are to the environment that

747
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,399
we're working on and we should use that

748
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:22,059
data to understand who is coming after

749
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:24,549
us and how they are coming after us

750
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:26,470
so here's what it's worth right we even

751
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:28,869
know how much we need to spend because

752
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,970
we can take this data on what it's worth

753
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:32,678
to the attacker and we can figure out

754
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,999
how many people they're gonna need what

755
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:36,099
equipment they're gonna buy how much

756
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:38,679
they're gonna pay for those zero days so

757
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:40,389
that that they can get something of

758
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,590
value to them so we know exactly how

759
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:44,258
much they're spending on what they're

760
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,639
gonna buy we know a little bit about

761
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:47,049
what what they're gonna buy is going to

762
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:49,539
look like and what it's going to cost

763
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:51,970
them we can use that data to figure out

764
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:54,489
what we should be spending in defense

765
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:58,119
based on the information that that we

766
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:59,909
have I know health care isn't spending

767
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:02,379
that money because you can see how

768
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:03,999
challenged they are just to provide the

769
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:08,139
services that they're trying to provide

770
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:09,789
in this country in order to really do

771
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:11,559
right by their patients but you know

772
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:13,809
last time I went to a new health care

773
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,099
provider they had to take a copy of my

774
00:30:13,809 --> 00:30:16,539
driver so they had to look at my

775
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:19,178
driver's license and I think they took a

776
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:21,009
copy of it when they copied my insurance

777
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:22,929
card because that insurance card is just

778
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:24,580
a flimsy peep a piece of paper that

779
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:26,590
anyone could make a copy of and they

780
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,599
could say hey I'm Larkin Rider I need a

781
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,668
new kidney by the way and you know it's

782
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:32,259
it just it's trivially easy unless they

783
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:34,389
can secure my identity with another

784
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:36,549
piece of collateral so I understand why

785
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:38,320
they took it and what I'm hoping is is

786
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:40,179
they took that piece of paper and they

787
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,099
put it in a file and they locked it in a

788
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:45,489
drawer and they didn't like you know

789
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:48,399
upload it to a system but I don't know

790
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:49,899
for sure right so you know we see how

791
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,928
much the health care industry gets

792
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:55,928
ransomed and that worries me because I

793
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:57,399
was talking with a friend and he was

794
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:58,840
saying yeah my concern is that the

795
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:02,580
ransomware that we hear about at

796
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,678
hospitals is just the visible example

797
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,379
how the healthcare industry is under

798
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:11,490
attack but they're really so owned in

799
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:13,470
every other way that they're working and

800
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,929
they have zero detection so they just

801
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,360
don't know it because detection to be

802
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:20,909
clear I know it's a hard problem like I

803
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:26,158
know it is not easy to figure out your

804
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:27,630
detection story but if this if I'd land

805
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,640
no other message in this presentation

806
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,070
and this is why I put this one at the

807
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,649
end is that we are the people who have

808
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,720
to be responsible for changing that

809
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:38,459
mindset and that attitude we have to

810
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,870
change that attitude in ourselves and

811
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:44,970
with the people that we work for how

812
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,678
will you know if you're owned how what

813
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:48,240
are what are the indicators that you

814
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:50,279
have and maybe you're like lark and I

815
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,559
got nothing I'm starting from zero maybe

816
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,779
I'm the first engineer at this company

817
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,700
that's thinking about security and I

818
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:59,159
haven't got a dollar - my budgets name

819
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,760
or a clue of how I'm going to move

820
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:06,570
forward well I would say start somewhere

821
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,070
right just pick one thing you've got to

822
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,019
start somewhere pick one thing that you

823
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,529
think is important and understand that

824
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:15,690
one thing in detail get those logs get

825
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:18,419
new logs if you need them study what

826
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:20,220
normal looks like and then build rules

827
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:21,899
on what abnormal looks like when it

828
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:27,539
occurs

829
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:30,059
red team rinse repeat so I worked for a

830
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:31,710
while for Bob Lord at Twitter and I read

831
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,240
a blog post he wrote one time it was

832
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,760
really interesting it was based on the

833
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,380
idea that if you need to build a new

834
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,879
security team and you don't have a

835
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,320
budget for it one of the things you

836
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,139
could do is just find enough money to

837
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,689
hire some red team bring in that red

838
00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:47,699
team don't you know don't do anything to

839
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:50,730
secure the systems don't put any

840
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:53,159
preventive measures in place just go in

841
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:54,840
with the red team and test them and test

842
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,669
them and test them and just keep showing

843
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,580
people how you're owning them over and

844
00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:01,679
over and over again until the people who

845
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,720
actually own the systems and care about

846
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,200
the data and understand what the risk of

847
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,779
the disclosure is they're they'll either

848
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,309
hire their own security team or give you

849
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,200
one I think that's an interesting

850
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:14,700
perspective I think they're good things

851
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,280
and bad things about that approach and

852
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,960
things that do

853
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,639
don't work in the business that I'm

854
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,470
currently in but it's interesting and

855
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,240
frankly I've always wanted to try it so

856
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,980
if any of you are in that position and

857
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,150
you're the first security engineer and

858
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,070
you're wondering how you're gonna get

859
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:29,020
through securing all of this

860
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,460
infrastructure you have let me know if

861
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,930
you're interested in try that I'd be

862
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:35,410
interested to know how that works out

863
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:39,430
for you all right

864
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:41,410
so in closing how do we keep on when we

865
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,330
have so much on our plate when we have

866
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,770
so many things you know I put this

867
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,810
presentation together and I'm like oh

868
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,020
man this is depressing like there is too

869
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:52,570
much here to think about how do we keep

870
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,790
from going crazy with this you know

871
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,919
infinite bag of risks that we all feel

872
00:33:54,790 --> 00:34:00,629
like we have to manage well I have some

873
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:02,950
ideas for you three really simple things

874
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:05,500
first of all please recognize your

875
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,300
burden I know I have to spend a lot of

876
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,800
time not thinking about that burden as

877
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,830
the person who is ultimately responsible

878
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,810
at SLAC but every now and then please

879
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,520
stop and recognize what you're doing and

880
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,529
how it's important and how you feel

881
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,520
about that and make sure that you're not

882
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:24,159
not thinking about it too hard and then

883
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,659
bound your efforts this is a strategy

884
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,280
that I've had to use and I've had to ask

885
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,990
my team to use you have an infinite

886
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,659
backlog of risk that you're trying to

887
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:33,810
manage don't try to boil that ocean

888
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:37,899
don't try to deal with it all at once

889
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:39,699
prioritize ruthlessly and work on the

890
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:41,440
first thing and let everything else wait

891
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:45,060
to the next sprint you can't do it all

892
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,740
at once you'll go crazy and then finally

893
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:50,350
lean on your community this is why we're

894
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:52,149
here so we have our community with us so

895
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,830
we get to spend a couple hours on one

896
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:55,989
week talking to the people who really

897
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:58,060
understand what we're doing what we're

898
00:34:55,989 --> 00:35:00,370
struggling with and how hard it can be

899
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:05,549
and maybe even get some tips for making

900
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:05,549
it a little bit better thank you so much

901
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:29,069
all right do I get to answer some

902
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:32,100
questions now thank you so much thank

903
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,800
you I appreciate it I appreciate it have

904
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:39,989
a great day everyone so you're out there

905
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,989
[Applause]
