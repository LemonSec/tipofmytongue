general counsel and deputy executive

15

director at the Electronic Frontier

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,010
Foundation I assume that many of you

17
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,050
came to this and Newt did so because you

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,470
knew what FF was but briefly for those

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,658
who are new we are a nonprofit

20
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,270
organization dedicated to defending your

21
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,450
rights online we work to defend privacy

22
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,070
free expression innovation we try and

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,740
make a future that you would want to

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,130
live in and push back against the

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,169
dystopias that seem to threaten us all

26
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:25,320
so we're gonna very briefly go down the

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,409
line here so we can introduce our lovely

28
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,479
and talented panel and then it's gonna

29
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,420
turn it over to your questions we only

30
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,658
have 25 minutes so we're going to keep

31
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:38,340
our introductory statements brief to

32
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,030
allow time for whatever questions you

33
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,729
may have so just a quick word about the

34
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,790
questions one of the things we do is

35
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,079
provide legal advice for a lot of people

36
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,960
actually in the security community

37
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,789
amongst others this is not the time or

38
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,048
the place to ask legal questions about

39
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,790
your situation

40
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,920
you want those things to be in a

41
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,240
attorney-client privileged communication

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,180
we should have those conversations

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,339
separately and privately this also

44
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,439
includes you say well hypothetically if

45
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,660
there was somebody not me that probably

46
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,140
is you and that's also not not where you

47
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,620
want to go so and that actually a good

48
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,720
segue

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,930
one of the things that I do with the FF

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,879
is the coders rights project where we

51
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,000
represent security researchers who have

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,920
questions about their legal issues that

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,500
they may face in doing the research and

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,109
in presenting the research I also work

55
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,510
with Jamie on this project

56
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,250
and so if you do have questions about

57
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,048
your own situations feel free to reach

58
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,860
out to us either after this talk or just

59
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:42,329
by emailing info at EF f dot org and

60
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:46,140
we'll see what we can do to help you

61
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:47,870
understand that situation so with that

62
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,700
I'll turn it down to Alexis

63
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,220

64

71
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:14,400
over a year and a half and I also do a

72
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,209
lot with the security education

73
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,400

76
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,200
technologies and tools but I mainly

the side for privacy scanning on

81
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:43,138
consumer devices so a lot goes on there

82
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,269
where I try to implement and track

83
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,060
things that go on in the background but

84
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,799

groundbreaking decision we tried to file

108
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,430

115
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,780
devices it's a range of different issues

116
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,180
hi I'm Daly I'm a staff technologist and

117
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,190
I work on privacy badger which is a

blocks third-party trackers oh and I

120
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,969
also work on like the security education

121
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,420
companion and surveillance self-defense

122
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,040
guides all right so that gives you a

123
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,180
brief overview of some of the things

124
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,470
that we're working on which hopefully

125
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,660
was enough to inspire some questions do

126
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:34,410
we have a first question who wants to be

127
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,900
bold I see someone in the in the far

128
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:51,510
back also we can't see any of you so

129
00:05:36,900 --> 00:06:08,789
speak out basically I'm blinded you'll

130
00:05:51,510 --> 00:06:11,810
get that mic on all right all right so

131
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,810
yeah I'll repeat the question

132
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:16,308
great great question so or Peeta for

133
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:19,509
those who might not have heard the the

134
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:22,249
question was about working for a company

135
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:24,619
and wants to make sure the company is

136
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:27,049
doing best practices when it comes to

137
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:28,609
securing the customer data protecting

138
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:31,519
them when the government comes knocking

139
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:34,789
to be sure that you know if a subpoena

140
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:37,519
comes in it's a valid subpoena that if

141
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:40,549
notice can be given to the customer that

142
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:44,299
the notice goes out at how to how to do

143
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:45,498
those best practices and so this is a

144
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:49,758
great question because this is something

145
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:51,499
we care so much about the the FF has

146
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,449
been trying to push for these best

147
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:54,889
practices for many years in fact we have

148
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:59,719
a project called the who has your back

149
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:05,049
project which it's about ten years old

150
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:08,269
and has given out shiny gold stars to

151
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:12,128
companies that adopt some of these best

152
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:14,509
practices for for notification for

153
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:19,069
requiring a warrant before handing over

154
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:21,829
content and so for one part of the

155
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:24,919
question what are the best practices so

156
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:27,409
we we have you can look up there who has

157
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:29,179
your back project we we've done

158
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:32,929
different kinds of things with this

159
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:34,669
project so but maybe two years ago we

160
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,088
did one going offer all these practices

161
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:40,390
for ISPs for the like you know facebook

162
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,880
twitter x'

163
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,550
and telecommunications providers like

164
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,410
AT&T what are the practice that they

165
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,760
should have and they are the practices

166
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:53,500
that you spoke of that really give your

167
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,280
customers notice so that if they have

168
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:59,140
information that if properly protected

169
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,160
from the government they can raise those

170
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,780
objections one of the things that he was

171
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,260
mentioning in the question was you know

172
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,310
you'll get a request and they'll say we

173
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,370
have this request we wanna get this

174
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,140
customers information and we ask you to

175
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,810
please kindly don't tell them about it

176
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:20,100
well as it turns out the government has

177
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,630
a process to to go to a court and say

178
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,640
give an order saying you can't tell the

179
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,930
customer about this information but

180
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,430
sometimes they don't don't want to do

181
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,900
that they don't want to go prove up to

182
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,729
the court why it's necessary why it

183
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,770
meets the legal standard they just

184
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,710
rather ask the SBE to please not

185
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:38,050
disclose it but that doesn't have the

186
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,670
the force of law and so what I think the

187
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,530
best practice there is to say the

188
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,360
government say yeah if you think it

189
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,010
shouldn't be told to the customer you

190
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,170
got to go to a court and prove it up you

191
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,540
got to come back with a court order

192
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,910
saying this is or we're gonna notify and

193
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,530
when we ask for the companies is to

194
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,540
notify the customer where they are

195
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,730
legally able to do so and if they're not

196
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:01,750
legally able to do so to do it should

197
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:03,610
the gag order eventually expire and that

198
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,170
provides people fair notice and the

199
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,650
government has all the opportunities it

200
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,819
needs to show to a court why it's not

201
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,490
acceptable to give out the information

202
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:22,450
but it needs to make its case and prove

203
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:24,490
what's right so thank you hi I follow

204
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,760
you on twitter so I had a question um

205
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,230
could you describe the Graham Blumenthal

206
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,240
proposal it's not something I've

207
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,860
actually seen in the news and what we

208
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:43,110
should be concerned with it is the one

209
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:43,110
Oh looks like a hole in this particular

210
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,650
proposal burn it

211
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:52,180
yes okay so so we don't have somebody

212
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,420
who's on our federal legislative team

213
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,359
Haley works on state

214
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,800
but nevertheless I have some familiarity

215
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,550
with it because I concur up ssin to

216
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:06,030
something that I do some work on and

217
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:08,400
this is this is a proposal that as I

218
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,560
understand it is sort of the nice

219
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,640
section 230 you have there and be shamed

220
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:18,209
for anything happened to it and what

221
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:22,860
it's trying to do is is tie the

222
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:24,870
protections of section 230 which service

223
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,880
providers on the internet depend to

224
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,670
protect themselves from liability for

225
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,840
what the users have done to whether or

226
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:38,310
not they follow best practices and best

227
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:41,160
practices in this context are going to

228
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,530
be determined and they're too in all

229
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,480
likelihood have a backdoor to encryption

230
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,370
like they're there they're beating

231
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,710
around the bush but they're not saying

232
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:53,670
explicitly but that is the idea behind

233
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:56,430
this and they have some some reasons why

234
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,810
you know well we think this is okay for

235
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,099
example there's gonna be a panel of

236
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,469
people who are gonna determine what the

237
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,690
best practices are but if they don't

238
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,600
determine it correctly then the Attorney

239
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,980
General Bill Barr can overrule them and

240
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,820
just determine what the best practices

241
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:14,730
are so it's not much of a safeguard and

242
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,550
this is this is something that the the

243
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:20,670
government has been trying for for many

244
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:23,520
years probably several decades now in

245
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,959
the crypto Wars to try to be able to get

246
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,140
access to your unencrypted

247
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,520
communications there there was a lull

248
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,130
the crypto Wars you could say which

249
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,900
crypto Wars part one and the 90s part

250
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,420
two now some people say we're in part

251
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,829
three but whatever part we're in they

252
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,589
are definitely back and they're

253
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:44,010
interested in getting access to

254
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:47,790
plaintext of communications and they

255
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:50,130
want the companies to figure out a way

256
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,380
to do that and the funny thing is that

257
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,480
if you if you make a law saying you must

258
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,160
put in a backdoor there actually are

259
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,450
some reasons why that would be

260
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,760
unconstitutional we would put a

261
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,190
challenge to that law and I think have a

262
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,510
pretty good chance of succeeding if

263
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,520
they're saying you simply cannot have

264
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,410
strong encryption but instead what

265
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,939
trying to do is get around that by

266
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,310
saying well you can have strong

267
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,730
encryption if you like but if you do so

268
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,979
you don't get section 230 and section

269
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,840
230 is the law that says basically that

270
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,390
the soapbox is not liable for what the

271
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,710
speaker has said it's come under a fair

272
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:27,640
amount of attack for a variety of

273
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:30,300
reasons these days and so they see this

274
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:33,900
as a threat point for the companies and

275
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:36,609
I would say that it's a lot of is about

276
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,980
Facebook's plan to put messenger and

277
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:42,220
encrypted and they're really upset about

278
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,540
that I guess I was hearing about the

279
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:48,250
situation but actually what was the

280
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,719
specific question you asked about it do

281
00:13:48,250 --> 00:14:09,850
you know just getting the details that's

282
00:13:49,720 --> 00:14:12,040
that's perfect yeah I just want to start

283
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:15,010
to say first thank you because I used

284
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,050
HTTPS Everywhere I use privacy batcher

285
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,760
I just let's encrypt so thank you so

286
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,609
much because I didn't pay anything for

287
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,710
that by the way I need just call out

288
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,470
that it's easy to support you guys there

289
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,360
is a booth there and I actually donated

290
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,900
so thank you and now to my question

291
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,340
because that was important too so I'm

292
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,620
actually from Spain so I was wondering

293
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:38,080
if you guys know an equivalent to the

294
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,780
uff in Spain or Europe I know we have

295
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,550
way stronger laws from privacy but you

296
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,550
guys do very important work still will

297
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:52,209
apply there so I'm actually interested

298
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:54,640
in that yeah I don't know what is in

299
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,710
Spain in particular in Spain there are

300
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,140
several in in Europe that we work with a

301
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:02,830
lot we do a lot of work with European

302
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:05,040
digital rights abbreviated Adri and they

303
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:09,010
are an umbrella organization which has

304
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,959
probably 30 or 40 digital rights

305
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,830
organizations that are part of an EFS

306
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,960
part of it and so you might want to find

307
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,670
one in Spain take a look at the entry

308
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,530
site and then look at there

309
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,990
member organizations and look for one in

310
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,880
Spain we've worked with a lot and other

311
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,670
places in Europe and they're like

312
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,770
privacy international in the UK like

313
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:33,099
quadrature du net and France bits of

314
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:35,980
freedom in the Netherlands and many and

315
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,260
many others but I don't offhand no one's

316
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,320
been there is a festival in Spain that

317
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:43,000
happens every year it's not necessary in

318
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,450
organization I believe it's Spain based

319
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,370
but the Internet freedom festival they

320
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:52,240
gathered there every year in Spain I

321
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:53,710
believe Valencia so yeah so the e FF

322
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,870
normally we have people that show up

323
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,390
normally I believe daily plans on

324
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,010
attending and a few others from the FF

325
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,660
plan on joining so they have that every

326
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,210
year in Spain if you're interested in

327
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,500
probably getting more people who are

328
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,300
interested what you're interested with

329
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,130
in privacy and security within that

330
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,370

down you guys are one of the

337
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,480
organizations i donate to annually I'm

338
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,980
very passionate about paying first open

339
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,720
source stuff and stuff like what you're

340
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,860
doing so can you demystify a bit at

341
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,320
least to the extent you're comfortable

342
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,880
about your funding sources and why it's

343
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,740
so important for I know you have some

344
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,540
membership dues things but you also have

345
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,770
just regular donators like me so could

346
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:57,069
you talk a little bit about that and how

347
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:59,290
you get your money absolutely glad to so

348
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,540
a FF first of all you can get a lot of

349
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:05,379
details just going to our website we

350
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:07,180
publish a annual report that goes over

351
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:08,590
various categories of funding that we

352
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,660
have received and you can look at that

353
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:14,290
over the last number of years we also

354
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:17,650
publish our IRS Form 990 s we are a 501

355
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:20,379
C 3 non-profit and so this is a tax form

356
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,240
that details a lot of the revenues and

357
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,060
expenditures so that information is

358
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,010
available I would say that like overall

359
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,120
we get funding from a couple different

360
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:33,510
sources so one is our members so there's

361
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:36,000
are individuals who join as an annual

362
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,430
member and you know it

363
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,370
ranges there's student memberships that

364
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,740
are at the low end and you can have you

365
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:48,389
know we have tiers that I think it

366
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,850
starts out in copper gold we have rare

367
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,170
earth is the highest level so a variety

368
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,790
of levels depending on your means you

369
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,970
get some great swag you could go to the

370
00:17:53,790 --> 00:18:00,360
booth upstairs if you want to join as a

371
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:04,380
member in addition we also have donors

372
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,809
who who just donate so either because I

373
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,670
don't want to get a membership or some

374
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:10,860
donors who donate above and beyond the

375
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,059
the membership level just because they

376
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,439
want to have a smart so he's a major

377
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:16,800
donors who are contributing

378
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,970
substantially and then we have

379
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:23,700
foundations so we apply for and receive

380
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,830
grants from foundations when they have

381
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,500
program work that they want to see done

382
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,909
that is something that where it's

383
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,530
appropriate for us we might apply for

384
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:37,070
that grant and that is probably another

385
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:40,399
substantial chunk of our of our budget

386
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:45,780
we have a couple of things which

387
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,900
supplement that one are very all

388
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,460
familiar with the Humble Bundle

389
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,900
so the Humble Bundle great great place

390
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,870
they have a pay which you could want

391
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,000
system and one of the things that they

392
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,399
do is in addition to paying for what you

393
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,620
want for books or video games or

394
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,820
whatever there they're selling you can

395
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,149
decide that a certain amount of that

396
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,730
goes to a non-profit so sometimes we are

397
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,580
on their bundles and we get actually a

398
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:15,740
fair amount of money donated through

399
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:19,260
that we get a fair amount of money from

400
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,059
individual donors who have companies

401
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:25,670
they work for who then will do matching

402
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:29,309
to the the donations that we receive and

403
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:31,200
we get some money from from companies

404
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:34,379
directly usually we'll be in the form of

405
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,350
sponsoring an event that's about maybe

406
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,990
five percent of our funding

407
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,669
and I think that's generally the range

408
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,920
of funding sources we haven't got a

409
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,270
modest endowment so we get a little bit

410
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,740
withdrawn from the endowment every year

411
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:49,080
that also goes into the into the funding

412
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,270
we also occasionally get Awards through

413
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,800
lawsuits if there's a class action it's

414
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,730
called a sigh prey award so if there was

415
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,050
a class action and the not everybody

416
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,690
like sent their little thing in for

417
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:02,190
their $0.50 or whatever there's a pot of

418
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,860
money remaining at the end and sometimes

419
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,420
if it's a privacy lawsuit then the the

420
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,610
lawyers on each side would get together

421
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,580
and sometimes they would pick iff to get

422
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,659
some of the money so we sometimes get

423
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,610
decent chunks of money through there and

424
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,980
we also like sometimes win our own fees

425
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,419
and FOIA cases that we bring will win

426
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,350
our own attorneys fees when we bring

427
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,720
those cases and those Giz be like they

428
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,949
can be pretty substantial depending on

429
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,530
how long we've been litigating the case

430
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,570
so and then I think we also do Amazon

431
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:33,149
smile donation like that's pretty small

432
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:37,560
but that's that's a that's a tens of

433
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:39,120
thousands of it yeah and all of this is

434
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,190
up on our website isn't in the annual

435
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,510
report and which i think is a it's a

436
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,860
very well done report I used to be a

437
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,090
reporter so I'm pretty critical about

438
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,649
those kinds of things and I think ours

439
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,139
is pretty well done and I should say too

440
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,520
and I think and I haven't looked at it

441
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,040
in a while but I think that we're over

442
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,770
50% funded by small donations and thanks

443
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,800
to 300 members so thank you everyone

444
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,570
who's a Meg here's a member thank you so

445
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,310
much whoever donated thank you again and

446
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,530
we really appreciate getting the small

447
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,270
membership support and that is really

448
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,040
it's great to have that kind of

449
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,590
grassroots support and also it's very

450
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,110
useful in our advocacy when we go speak

451
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,360
to like legislators and say you know we

452
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,590
have this many members it gives us a

453
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,919
little bit more credence when when

454
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,560
making wiser you listen to us every

455
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,360
state legislation letter that I send is

456
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,340
you know we have over 30,000 members

457
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,129
including this many in your States are

458
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,649
very helpful it was someone over here

459
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,360
yes so we we have a question in the back

460
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,920
here and then you said there's someone

461
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,949
on the front there there's someone in

462
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,779
the on the far side all right

463
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:45,480
I'll need your help waiting when I run

464
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:46,799
back down but here you go okay carry me

465
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,789
all right

466
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:56,149
to what degree has tor eroded over time

467
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:58,559
if at all eroded yeah I have any of the

468
00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:00,239
computational non triviality elements of

469
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,009
tor wrote it anyway to your knowledge

470
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,830
especially with endpoints in Western

471
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:07,440
Europe and the United States oh I don't

472
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:10,230
have any knowledge at the moment of Tor

473
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,539
being eroded essentially over time tor

474
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:15,690
has been developed as a network that you

475
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:17,580
know has been hosted and volunteered by

476
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,769
many different nodes xing knows entry

477
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,350
nodes and I think the entropy between

478
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:24,509
all of them is definitely something to

479
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,158
do account for at times and sometimes

480
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,659
some sources are reliable and some

481
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,340
sources aren't there's been a lot of

482
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:31,289
criticism in the past of the Tor network

483
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,449
itself and funding resources and things

484
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:35,340
of that nature but for the most part I

485
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:36,899
haven't heard of anything being eroded

486
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:41,820
in particular is there a particular

487
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:44,789
event you're referring to rumors okay

488
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,110
rumors and concerns well right now there

489
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:48,629
has amazing that comes to light in

490
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:50,459
particular as far as like vulnerability

491
00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:52,408
disclosure and I worked particularly

492
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,009
with a tor browser so I can only speak

493
00:22:52,409 --> 00:22:58,139
for the circuits that go within that as

494
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:59,909
like someone who works with them not

495
00:22:58,139 --> 00:23:01,590
necessarily on behalf of the Tor network

496
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:03,629
so I'm not speaking on behalf of them

497
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,529
speaking somebody works with them on a

498
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:07,019
daily basis

499
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:08,850
and since HTTPS Everywhere the web

500
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:11,100
extension I work with is packaged within

501
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,748
the tor browser normally they have a lot

502
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,340
of volunteers people to look over things

503
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:16,799
all the time patch things all the time

504
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,350
they have a really vast volunteer

505
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,720
network in terms of the reliability of

506
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,519
the nose themselves they've been doing a

507
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,429
better job of documentation of how to

508
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,529
create entry and exit nodes for the most

509
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:30,210
part and a lot of it I would say if any

510
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:32,369
erosion has occurred there's a lot of

511
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:33,990
websites out there that do blocked or

512
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:37,320
nodes so that has been something that's

513
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:39,149
been more I would say apparent that I've

514
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,730
noticed over time especially in the past

515
00:23:39,149 --> 00:23:42,979
two years or so a lot of endpoints will

516
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,820
block No

517
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:49,730
or exit notes whether or not that's

518
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,830
something that's considered a practice

519
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,540
that should be put in play from

520
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:56,149
different services especially site

521
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,909
reliability services I'm not quite sure

522
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,049
what they are told in terms of blocking

523
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,880
tour nodes I don't know if they're

524
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:04,250
talking about blocking malicious traffic

525
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,130
they tour often gets labeled as

526
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:10,280
malicious traffic in certain cases so I

527
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:12,440
would say that in that respect I can

528
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:16,280
speak and say that's what I've seen on

529
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,710
my end so far I would also add that the

530
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,210
tour developers like often say that

531
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,580
compromised nodes are in their threat

532
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:31,850
model and tor still works with that in

533
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:34,010
like in in mind all right we have like

534
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:50,299
one minute left let's get at least one

535
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:52,429
more question in here earlier today the

536
00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:56,799
you have Twitter accounts made a post

537
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:59,059
regarding facial recognition technology

538
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,190
Washington State currently has some

539
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:05,570
facial recognition technology bills in

540
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:10,040
debates and I've given those a review

541
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:11,299
they're not as strong as I would like do

542
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,970
you have comments you'd like to share on

543
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:16,250
on that on other states involved in this

544
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,710
and what's going on oh how much time do

545
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,169
you have

546
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:23,809
so you're absolutely right so Washington

547
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:26,330
does have they have a couple of bills in

548
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:28,850
the running right now there is a good

549
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,409
there is a bill that is sponsored by

550
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,480
they silly Washington that we actually

551
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,730
think it is fairly strong and that we do

552
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,410
like that is a moratorium on government

553
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,750
used to face surveillance across the

554
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,360
state and until the legislature deems

555
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,100
that it would be okay again to restart

556
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:48,020
it so we are a fan of that bill and

557
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:50,270
there is a general sort of they call it

558
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,460
a gdpr light bill I would disagree with

559
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,649
that characterization

560
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,570
there is a consumer data privacy bill in

561
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:57,399
Washington that includes regulation of

562
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:00,340
face recognition we do not feel that

563
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:02,199
that is a strong bill and I have been

564
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,928
working a lot over the past couple of

565
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,630
weeks with folks at the ACLU watch a CLU

566
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:09,070
of Washington and other national privacy

567
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:13,270
groups around the country to oppose that

568
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:14,889
bill and it is it is passed the Senate

569
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,320
it is in the house committee right now

570
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:20,320
and we are working on comments for that

571
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,620
so but yeah I would say in general

572
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,200
biometric biometric surveillance

573
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,149
moratoria bills are popping up in a lot

574
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,279
of places across the country and of

575
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:32,049
course we've seen a lot of work on that

576
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:34,510
at the municipal level so San Francisco

577
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,950
Oakland for example both have ordinances

578
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,510
that banned government used to face

579
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,039
surveillance in their cities and we are

580
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:41,649
starting to see that bubble up to the

581
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,629
state level and but there are also a lot

582
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:46,178
of people who do not want to see

583
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:48,279
moratoria or bands and so you know

584
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:49,690
they're trying to regulate around it but

585
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:51,580
we feel that that is that this is a

586
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,490
technology particularly wooden used by

587
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,779
the government that is just first of all

588
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,200
not ready for prime time it's not

589
00:26:55,779 --> 00:27:01,179
accurate enough in a lot of ways and

590
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,429
also it is so invasive that we need to

591
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:05,080
really stop the stock use of it and in

592
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:07,919
our communities and have serious

593
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,918
conversations a minute

594
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,749
[Music]

595
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:33,760
interesting um sure yeah are you in law

596
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:36,500
school okay oh maybe you said that um

597
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,420
yeah I don't mean the way that I ended

598
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,990
up at EF f as I just kind of pursued

599
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:44,090
things I thought were interesting until

600
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:46,390
and I was particularly interested in in

601
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:49,760
privacy issues when I was in law school

602
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:52,040
but but yeah I think like following I

603
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,180
think the legislation involving security

604
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,700
and encryption

605
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,950
I think getting in touch with the with

606
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,610
the security research community it's

607
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:02,990
always a good idea just learning the

608
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:06,889
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and why

609
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:08,660
it's terrible it's a nice idea um no no

610
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:11,840
Kirk do you have any other thoughts well

611
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:15,350
I think about a clerkship yeah you could

612
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,540
do that fellowship yes I did I had I

613
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:21,260
applied for iff for a fellowship and

614
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:24,379
that's how I ended up here and then I

615
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:28,370
became a staff attorney so yeah I think

616
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:30,230
pursuing nonprofit work and if they hit

617
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,000
places like the EMF I think the ACLU

618
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,320
also does think there's a lot of

619
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,590
organizations

620
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:42,409
um on East Coast to to look into to do

621
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:45,879
this kind of work all right there was a

622
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,880
woman up there just be very patient

623
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,440
recently the Russian Federation

624
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,030
announced that they'd be developing an

625
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,250
internal network similar to how the

626
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:02,090
DARPA net is for the US government but a

627
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:04,310
civilian forum does the e FF any if it's

628
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:06,199
the case that they're Russian Federation

629
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:08,960
is successful at this model and other

630
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,750
countries look to them as a form of

631
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,150
adoption does the FF have any plans to

632
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,840
resist like an eventual balkanization of

633
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:21,370
the entire internet into local state

634
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,350
forms destroy all privacy as we know it

635
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:27,879
so shall we destroy all privacy as we

636
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,879
know it no I know

637
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,870
balkanization of the internet I think

638
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,720
actually China was really taking the

639
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:42,300
lead there with having a very strong

640
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:45,130
firewall surrounding it and Russia has

641
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,810
I'm not familiar with this DARPA like

642
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,270
project but for a while they've had some

643
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:53,110
laws on the books saying that you had to

644
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:55,690
locally host information which is you

645
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:58,030
know the step towards creating that to

646
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,250
to try and have it so they could but

647
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:02,170
this actually hasn't been limited to

648
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:05,290
more authoritarian regimes like China

649
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:07,060
and Russia the EU for a while was like

650
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:09,670
should we have our own internet because

651
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,830
they were they were more concerned about

652
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:14,380
some of the consumer privacy issues that

653
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:17,050
were arising I mean ultimately the

654
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,930
solution to that was the gdpr and trying

655
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:23,290
to regulate the American companies on

656
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:25,720
consumer privacy but was maybe five or

657
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,200
six years ago they were still talking

658
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,570
about creating a separate European

659
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:34,690
internet i think these these ideas are

660
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:37,960
generally bad ideas and one of the

661
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:40,630
advantages of the internet is the the

662
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,730
free flow of information can be good can

663
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,260
be bad on the whole it seems to be for

664
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:47,010
the best

665
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:49,960
and then when particular regions are

666
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:53,620
insisting on having everything in their

667
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,150
in their jurisdiction that makes it very

668
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,530
tough for the civil liberties of the

669
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,510
people inside that juristic and

670
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:01,990
especially in cases where it's a

671
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:03,700
authoritarian regime often where they

672
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:07,600
will you not have to go through any

673
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:09,480
serious legal checks or you know judge

674
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,810
to weigh in before gaining information

675
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,180
in many cases the government owns the

676
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:19,720
telecommunications infrastructure and if

677
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:22,960
the material is on their networks then

678
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,790
it is really easy to find out who an

679
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,070
opposition figure is who is something

680
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:30,190
that's an irritant to the authoritarian

681
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:33,909
regime so we certainly think these are a

682
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:35,830
bad idea I would say like our ability to

683
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,429
influence the Russian government is

684
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,168
limited

685
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:42,799
so we can tell them it's a bad idea

686
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:45,049
but they may not listen but some of the

687
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,340
things that are still useful to do is

688
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:51,559
technology to try ignoring that like the

689
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:53,869
Tor project can help help people sort of

690
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:55,399
disguise where their IP is from and

691
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:56,988
maybe able to get outside of those

692
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:59,859
jurisdictions there are people who do

693
00:31:56,989 --> 00:32:02,090
bridges outside of the Chinese firewall

694
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:04,730
so there are some interesting technology

695
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:08,658
projects to at least provide people with

696
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:10,759
an escape route from a restricted and in

697
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:12,379
places where there is more of a rule of

698
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:15,350
law one thing I thought was interesting

699
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:17,090
that in Turkey there for a while they

700
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,498
had a ban on Wikipedia but they didn't

701
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:22,369
like some of the things that Wikipedia

702
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:24,710
was saying and that was that was ruled

703
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:27,830
to be unconstitutional evident from the

704
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,649
Turkish law - to block that so that

705
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,699
thing to be like a good rule for

706
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:33,469
understanding that things that outside

707
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,210
of that local network were valuable

708
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:39,080
resources and blocking access to them

709
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:42,409
was a civil liberties problem but on the

710
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:46,428
negative side in ten places where even

711
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:49,190
having a VPN on your technology on your

712
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:50,960
and your laptop or your mobile phone can

713
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,009
be caused for suspicion even if they

714
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,600
don't know that you're using it to

715
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:58,149
access some of these additional

716
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,149
resources so it's an ongoing struggle

717
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:12,870
um curious if you are taking up any act

718
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,680
or innocent initially initiating any

719
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:18,840
activity with regard to election

720
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,110
security and social media with respect

721
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,770
to you know this idea that social media

722
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:26,699
is now essentially may be equivalent to

723
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:29,910
broadcasters like radio and television

724
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,960
and should they fall into the nineteen

725
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:35,850
thirty to tell the community

726
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,460
Telecommunications Act or if there's any

727
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,620
other strategies that you're you know or

728
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,900
or ways you're taking up the fight with

729
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,389
this regard to disinformation elections

730
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,800
community and so on it's being trimmed

731
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:51,380
you know traversing through the social

732
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:58,860
media platforms say a few things

733
00:33:51,380 --> 00:34:02,130
yeah so on election security we've

734
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,929
looked actually mostly on the security

735
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,880
of the the election systems in lecture

736
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:07,590
infrastructure point of view we've been

737
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,290
working with some security researchers

738
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:12,029
who want to be able to do research on

739
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,139
the on those systems but I think you're

740
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,260
talking about sort of a different sort

741
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:19,110
of thing with the the disinformation

742
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:22,470
aspects of it and so we've done a lot of

743
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:24,840
work on content moderation one of the

744
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:26,189
projects that we and several other civil

745
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,950
liberties organizations did was the

746
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:30,840
Santa Clara principles which were

747
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:34,469
principles about how to do content

748
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,620
moderation and that is about it all

749
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:39,209
sorts of content moderation including

750
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:40,918
disinformation so it's not targeted

751
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,050
specifically about that but as good

752
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:44,339
principles for it thought geology and a

753
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,260
lot of times it were we're worried about

754
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:50,010
is over

755
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:52,830
moderation yeah that the freedom of

756
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:57,000
expression will be overly limited by

757
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:58,350
people's zeal to remove things so we

758
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,690
want to ensure that there are appeals

759
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,950
processes and ways for people who whose

760
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,380
information was taken down

761
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:05,460
inappropriately have a chance to to make

762
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,380
their case and say and

763
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,339
why shouldn't have been taken down I

764
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:14,369
think there are a lot of things that you

765
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:17,250
can be concerned about with this

766
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:21,869
information how can affect a public

767
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:23,460
discourse I don't believe that we have

768
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:26,720
we don't any current programs at least

769
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,859
to to push for having it regulated under

770
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,970
as a broadcast medium on our

771
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:35,220
telecommunications system I would say

772
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,569
though if you're if you're you know

773
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,109
there's a lot that goes with government

774
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:41,849
led regulation and that involves a lot

775
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:46,380
of trust that the government regulators

776
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:49,320
will be doing a good job at it and on

777
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,690
terms of disinformation there's actually

778
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,000
like a lot of must-carry kinds of things

779
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,560
for political ads where they couldn't on

780
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,780
a broadcast medium take something down

781
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:02,040
for having false information and now

782
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,170
there's a lot of companies being

783
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,080
criticized for choosing not to take

784
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:11,220
coming down for having false information

785
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:13,529
but I think if it was under a under the

786
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:16,049
broadcast standards there are actually

787
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:18,869
less options of choosing what goes up or

788
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,609
doesn't go up in political ads one

789
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:22,530
concrete example something we've worked

790
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:24,750
on related to this and this is this is

791
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:28,109
to curt the point about the overreach is

792
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:29,940
in California last year I think it was

793
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:33,390
last year maybe it was the year before I

794
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,490
know that makes me mush together there

795
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,368
is a bot labeling go do it

796
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:41,339
2002 years ago oh my god okay so this

797
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:43,680
was two years ago and it was like a DMCA

798
00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:45,750
inspired Botley Boonville we don't like

799
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,810
the DMCA if you're familiar with us you

800
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:51,869
probably know that there there's a lot

801
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,910
of things that were so in it was it was

802
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:56,099
overreached it would cover any type of

803
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:59,339
bot online and required to be labeled

804
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:00,869
and of course anyone who's a really bad

805
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:03,330
actor wasn't gonna pay attention to this

806
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:04,260
and so we worked with the legislature to

807
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,670
try to

808
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,650
and we did actually successfully get

809
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,140
them to narrow the bill to the types of

810
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:13,290
I mean what is actually harmful is maybe

811
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,720
like BOTS operating at scale

812
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,520
to make people appear with people with

813
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,910
resources appear that they have way more

814
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,920
reach and way more people that agree

815
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,680
with them they actually do not just

816
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,250
one-off people who like funny BOTS or

817
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,750
poetry BOTS or something like that and

818
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,520
so for us there were First Amendment

819
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:35,190
implications and we think that if they

820
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,009
pass a lot that was as broad as it was

821
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,930
when it was initially drafted I was

822
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,340
going to create all sorts of First

823
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,259
Amendment problem so we worked with the

824
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,120
legislature there to get them to narrow

825
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,000
the bill and they ended up passing a

826
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,210
bill that went into effect last July I

827
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,410
think it's still kind of yet to be seen

828
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:55,290
like how exactly it's going to work out

829
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:57,060
in practice but but that that's one

830
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,590
place where and we didn't just

831
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,480
completely oppose it we helped them

832
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:03,960
narrow it in a way that we thought would

833
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,180
be constitutional so unfortunately we do

834
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,340
have work yep sorry about that Hart that

835
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,890
hard cutoff but everyone give a great

836
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:14,450
round of applause for the yeah thank you

837
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,450
