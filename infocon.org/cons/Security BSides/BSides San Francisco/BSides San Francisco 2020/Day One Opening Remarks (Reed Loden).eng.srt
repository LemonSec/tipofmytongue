pancakes delicious and are ready for a

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:41,489
great full day of events so the event is

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,120
the work of about 30 staffers working

15
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,879
year-round and so it's very much put on

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,559
by and for the community a hundred

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:50,430
percent volunteer organized none of us

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,699
are paid to do this

19
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,320
it takes a lot of work my day job

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,289
thankfully enough gives me some time to

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,300
work on this but otherwise it is a lot

22
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,570
of time to do this so really do

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,330
appreciate all of our volunteers we have

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,630
actually a 185 volunteers helping us out

25
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,640
this weekend plus we have the the call

26
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,670
for papers review committee and our

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,409
capture-the-flag team work tons of hours

28
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,990
to get go through all the talks or the

29
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,790
workshop that have been submitted put

30
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,259
together the the puzzles for the capture

31
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,369
the flag event so let's just give our

32
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,430
everybody round of applause to all the

33
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,489
volunteers

34
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,489
[Applause]

35
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,539
so the goal is to expand that the

36
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,540
spectrum of communication so one of the

37
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,970
big things about besides is that we're

38
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,240
always trying to you know present the

39
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,250
next big thing and specifically that you

40
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,770
know there are no attendees at besides

41
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:50,500
events everyone is a participant so

42
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,850
everyone's expected to actually you know

43
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,520
contribute something back to the

44
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:57,460
conversation and we can do this in a lot

45
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,750
of different ways so while we have you

46
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,149
know four different talking tracks going

47
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,729
on this this weekend we also had the

48
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:07,330
workshops yesterday over at hashey Corp

49
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:11,530
we have a ton for different villages

50
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:13,690
this year we have again capture the flag

51
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,610
and there's a lot of just just general

52
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,200
kind of like hallway con stuff where you

53
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,500
can always just go and chat with people

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,440
and and just share ideas and discuss

55
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,580
things so make sure you do that so you

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,350
know you don't always have to spend time

57
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,920
in the talks you can always do all these

58
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,600
other things so in fact so we actually

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,988
have three different floors worth of

60
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,260
stuff so we have here on the city view

61
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,420
floor this is where so this is the

62
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,489
Embarcadero track is here we have our

63
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,380
participant hall next door and the

64
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:48,310
combination of the Presidio and Twin

65
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,019
Peaks rooms and that is we flip-flop

66
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,120
this year for folks they've been here

67
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,459
last two years but we're hoping that

68
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,200
that layout works well it's the kind of

69
00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:00,760
combination of the bar and chill-out

70
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,230
space the villages and all the sponsors

71
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,780
as well so make sure to kind of walk

72
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:09,070
around that mezzanine level is where you

73
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,290
registered and then down on AMC we have

74
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,510
five different theaters three different

75
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,480
tracks and then to overflow theaters as

76
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,519
well and then we also have our Career

77
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,470
Center which we took last year has the

78
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,489
besides chitchat space and we it's now a

79
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,720
full-blown career as well so as I said

80
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:29,080
just lots of opportunities for

81
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,450

108
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,330
including vaping you need to go all the

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,700
way down to the ground level so

110
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,260
questions answer we're doing slide Oh

111
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,760
again this year we have a little better

112
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,849
setup than last year so hopefully it

113
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,950
works but a lot of the signs actually

114
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,560
have a QR code you can scan but if you

115
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:50,620
just go to the slider calm you can in

116
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:54,340
Orbeez SSF 2020 and then you can ask

117
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,870

that'll that'll show you all of them so

120
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,400
make sure whatever track you're in that

121
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,030
you select that before you ask a

122
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,739
question but we want to hear if this is

123
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,609
working for you we want to know if this

124
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,620
is if this is actually you know creating

125
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,450
an atmosphere for for this conversation

126
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,820
so please give us feedback we've

127
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,580
relished the feedback we read through it

128
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,979
all multiple times and learn from it

129
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,330
like we learned that like last year

130
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:24,430
people didn't generally like the coffee

131
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,830
so we completely have a brand new coffee

132
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,919
vendor this year so hopefully people

133
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:32,620
enjoy that you can give feedback online

134
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,510
at besides SF dot org slash feedback if

135
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,310
you have specific feedback about speaker

136
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:40,360
talks that you've heard or any kind of

137
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,530
sessions go on sched and you should

138
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,990
there's a place there to provide

139
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:49,780
feedback so we take the creating a safe

140
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,900
environment very seriously so we've had

141
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,679
a code in connect for many years you

142
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,900
know it

143
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,430
boils down to the golden rule show

144
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,739
respects and tolerance for each other's

145
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,669
uniqueness be kind and practice the

146
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,710
golden rule

147
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:04,180
simply put don't be an ass or we'll kick

148
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,090
your ass out it's really what it boils

149
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,400
down to absolutely zero tolerance for

150
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,539
any kind of physical verbal or sexual

151
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,219
harassment intimidation or

152
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:15,909
marginalization of any human that

153
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:18,280
includes robots as well okay if you have

154
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,199
an issue our witness any kind of

155
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,448
behavior that is not consistent with

156
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,030
this policy please let any staff member

157
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:28,900
or any public safety member know and we

158
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,400
will take care of it for the full code

159
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,109
of conduct we have signs throughout the

160

back so hygiene a lot of people have

163
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,840
been concerned about coronavirus we've

164
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,310
had a number of people reach out to us

165

as far as I know any participants and

167
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,820
such that have not been able to attend

168
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,039
which is great but we also understand

169
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:57,070
that the risk is there it is

170
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:59,469
not has not been seen in San Francisco

171
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,180
at all but but we understand that some

172
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,919
people may not want to shake hands or

173
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,130
hug or such and so you just need to

174
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:09,820
respect that just please pay practice

175
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:11,380
basic courtesy when coughing there is

176
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,000
hand sanitizer thanks to one of our

177
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,180
sponsors in your bag so please use it

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,940
religiously and then wash your hands so

179
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,520
that's that's how we ask there's again

180
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,199
hand sanitizer also throughout the

181
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,740
theaters we're washing down all the

182
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,039
surfaces regularly washing the mics so

183
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,860
we just you know ask you to help with us

184
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,020
help us with that thank you and then we

185
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,820
have our video and photo policy which is

186
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,849
again it's a bit different than a lot of

187
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,620
things you know we we basically say that

188
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:42,909
like hey if you're taking a picture just

189
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,460
make sure you have permission of

190
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:48,210
everybody in the shot and then that

191
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,830
crowd shots are generally discouraged

192
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:53,349
there is one exception to this policy

193
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,690
new this year we actually have a fishel

194
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:57,759
photographer the first time in you know

195
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:01,330
10 years helping to capture the magic

196
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,340
that is is besides she's walking around

197
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,669
with a vendor badge she is right over

198
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,679
there

199
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:07,448
if she if she happens to be taking a

200
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,029
photo and you do not want to be in

201
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:11,439
please feel free she's very friendly go

202
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:11,979
up to her and say hey I'd rather not be

203
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,680
in that photo

204
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:17,050
hey or blur my face out she's more than

205
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,759
happy to do that but we have literally

206
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,990
no photos of besides stuff so we're

207
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,610
trying something new to actually

208
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:27,520
hopefully we can get have some photos

209
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:29,409
for once but so again like every year we

210
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,169
have our t-shirt charities it's an

211
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:35,289
opportunity to kind of let the community

212
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:38,228
give back so when you purchase a t-shirt

213
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:41,019
all the the sales proceeds actually

214
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,510
benefit several deserving charities we

215
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,920
have iff hackers for charities and the

216
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,170
sisters of professional indulgence

217
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,990
you'll hear more about that later in the

218
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,510
day but all these are great charities

219
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,130
and they do a lot for unscrewed

220
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,730
community or the local community here in

221
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,740
San Francisco

222
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:00,040
again this are your theme this year is

223
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,930

224
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,099
our big focuses this year so you'll see

225
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:08,050
a lot of stuff with San Francisco theme

226
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,480
and then last but not least this event

227
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:14,199
would not be possible without the the

228
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,550
support of our sponsors it cost a lot of

229
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:20,079
money to put on event on in San

230
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:22,449

231
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,709

233
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:27,609

234
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,920
