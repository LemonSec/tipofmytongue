00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
all right everybody welcome Arkady

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:11,099
gentlemen chief or head of

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,239
infrastructure and security at chime is

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,698
that correct there you go

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,470
hi everyone welcome to non-political

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,980
security learnings from the Moller

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,529
report

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,789
my name is arkady Tuttleman thanks for

9
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,198
being here

10
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,849
when I originally wrote this talk was a

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,859
little bit longer than 25 minutes so I'm

12
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,240
gonna try and go really fast but the

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,630
slides will be online that's recorded of

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,969
course so you'll get to see the agenda

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,309
for today I'm gonna start off with some

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,690
brief background about the Moller report

17
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,339
the timeline over the report kind of

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,070
give us all some shared context to think

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,370
about then we'll dive into blue team

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,840
learnings talk about the timeline of the

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,879
attacks recommendations for

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,440
organizations what tools the GRU

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,449
installed what data they stole that sort

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,750
of stuff hopefully there's time at the

25
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,329
end for questions so when we're talking

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,379
about the Moller report this is really

27
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,199
the timeline that I'm thinking about

28
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,179
even as early as May 2014 the IRA the

29
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,798
internet research agency started their

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,040
social media disinformation campaign

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,450
this was before any candidates had even

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,020
announced their intention to run for

33
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,610
president

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,289
so just general sowing discord and once

35
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,909
certain candidates had announced their

36
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,110
intention to run then the campaign did

37
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,930
pivot and start to favor certain

38
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,350
candidates or disfavor other candidates

39
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,670
a bit later in March to June of 2016 was

40
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,619
when you saw the GRU phishing and

41
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,329
hacking campaign so most the time when

42
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,890
the media talks about you know Russia

43
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,179
hacking the election or all this stuff

44
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,470
going on that are really talking about

45
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,700
that three-month window that's when the

46
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,530
bulk of the activity happened in July of

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,500
2016 the FBI opened their investigation

48
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,600
in May of 2017 Robert Muller was

49
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,420
appointed after James coach Comey was

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,009
dismissed and in March 2019 the FBI

51
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,899
investigation was concluded and the

52
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,790
redacted report was a released a month

53
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,979
later and the redacted report actually

54
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,570
was like 95% under redacted most of the

55
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:05,340
report was there so overall it took

56
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,740
about three years to do this

57
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,239
investigation employed about 20

58
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,978
attorneys and paralegals nine support

59
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,349
staff worked on one side for the FBI

60
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,650
staff so 70 people working for three

61
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,018
years

62
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,269
pretty expensive estimated cost of 25

63
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:20,610
million dollars but actually the report

64
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:22,140
brought in an estimated gain of close to

65
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,940
50 million dollars paid for itself twice

66
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,619
over the reason for that was that they

67
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,370
uncovered a lot of tax evasion and then

68
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:35,069
they were able to him and that off to

69
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:36,390
the relevant authorities so the report

70
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,010
was split into two volumes the first

71
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,839
volume was focused on Russian

72
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,760
interference in the 2016 election which

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,010
was its blood itself split into five

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,700
different sections the first one was an

75
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,319
introduction

76
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,480
the second section was focused on this

77
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,129
active measures social media campaign

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,629
which is what the IRA did kind of like

79
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,950
trying to run these political ads on

80
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,679
Facebook and Twitter and elsewhere

81
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,869
the third section was the hacking and

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,220
dumping campaign fourth and fifth

83
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,409
sections aren't relevant for us and then

84
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,870
the second volume was the administration

85
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,250
obstruction of justice so for this talk

86
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,750
I'm really just going to only be talking

87
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,400
about Volume one section three the

88
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,599
hacking and dumping campaign because

89
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,489
that's what has the most broadly

90
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,569
applicable blue team learnings that you

91
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:13,769
know we're all security practitioners

92
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,379
here that's what we'll get value out of

93
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,819
I would say that specifically if you

94
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,989
work at a social media company like a

95
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,290
Twitter or Facebook or something else

96
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,700
like that

97
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,440
I do recommend reading the active

98
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,700
measures section because there's a lot

99
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,120
of interesting information in there for

100
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,339
you and also the report in general if

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,750
you don't have the time to read it the

102
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,400
whole thing is quite dense but if you're

103
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,510
interested the executive summary is only

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,760
like 20 pages long

105
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:40,200
at the start of each volume so that's

106
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,940
pretty interesting and accessible so

107
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,018
blue team learnings like I said we're

108
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,250
really just gonna zoom in on this

109
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,949
three-month section that's when the bulk

110
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,650
of the activity happened starting on

111
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:51,239
March 10th to 15th the GRU sent out

112
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,699
about 90 spear phishing emails to

113
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,900
various Hillary Clinton comm email

114
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:59,790
addresses starting on March 15th the GRU

115
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,319
started to target personal Google

116
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,620
accounts of Clinton staffers and some C

117
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,030
n DNC org accounts and notably on March

118
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,769
19th

119
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,150
John Podesta was fished and if you can't

120
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,129
recall a John Podesta was Clinton's

121
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,780
campaign chairman at the time so this

122
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:15,358
was a pretty significant event for the

123
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,310
election cycle it was quite damaging I

124
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,160
think so I'm going to show you an email

125
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,860
here this is an email from Google

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,200
someone has your password hi so-and-so

127
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,480
someone has your password review your

128
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,740
devices go and change your password etc

129
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,630
I would love to throw a pole to the

130
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,520
audience the two options are going to be

131
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,710
this is a real email or this is a

132
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,940
phishing email can I see a show of hands

133
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,320
who thinks this is a real email I'm a

134
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,090
little bit blinded by light but I think

135
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,280
I see like a handful like two three

136
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:50,729
hands who thinks this is a phishing

137
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:52,469
email a lot more ants most people so it

138
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,510
turns out it is both this is a real

139
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,190
email that Google will send you if they

140
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,390
think with I certainty that someone has

141
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,340
logged into your account and it is not

142
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,400
you it is also the template that the

143
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,299
juror you use to fish John Podesta

144
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,890
so if you raised your hand for either

145
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,810
you were correct if you raised your hand

146
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,270
for both you were doubly correct if you

147
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:14,610
raised her hand for neither you probably

148
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:16,740
don't like audience participation but so

149
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,260
John Podesta had a personal aide Sarah

150
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,450
she had access to his personal email

151
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,159
account and she saw this email first she

152
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,960
saw it before he did and she thought

153
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,250
something is suspicious about this it

154
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,919
doesn't look quite right so she

155
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,200
forwarded it to the Clinton campaign IT

156
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,150
staff and this was the email exchange

157
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,340
that happened Charles Delavan replied

158
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,719
Sarah this is a legitimate email John

159
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,650
needs to change his password immediately

160
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,120
and ensure that two-factor

161
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,159
authentication is turned on his account

162
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,160
he can go to this link to do both it is

163
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,410
imperative that this is done ASAP does

164
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,750
anyone see anything weird about this

165
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:54,240
email something inconsistent I'm happy

166
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:58,410
to give it away if nobody wants to speak

167
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,200
up hmm

168
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,380
Shane I'm not sure who Shane and someone

169
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,820
else that they decided to see see

170
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,530
basically the very first sense of this

171
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,270
email says this is a legitimate email

172
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,799
and the rest of the email seems to

173
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,479
scream that this is not a legitimate

174
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,150
email so it's a little bit inconsistent

175
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,010
and so Charles Delavan later became an

176
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,390
interview to the New York Times where he

177
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,010
said that his bad advice was the result

178
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,300
of a typo he knew this was a phishing

179
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,919
attack as the campaign was getting

180
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,419
dozens of them he said he had meant to

181
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,520
type that it was an illegitimate email

182
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,500
an error that he said has plagued him

183
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,060
ever since which is just fascinating to

184
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,530
me because I you know I think we talked

185
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,150
a lot in security about how we have to

186
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,159
do things that scale we can't depend on

187
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,690
the single point of failures like one

188
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,580
person needs to patch the server one

189
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,870
person needs to like recognize the

190
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,690
phishing email like obviously these

191
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,430
things will never scale

192
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,940
at the same time I think this was like a

193
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,950
pretty pivotal moment in 2016 so it's

194
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,090
just very interesting to think about the

195
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:54,190
counterfactual of what would have

196
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:56,500
happened if he didn't make that typo so

197
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,120
in terms of overall fished accounts the

198
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,950
GRU fished numerous email accounts of

199
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,020
Clinton campaign employees and

200
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,190
volunteers they fished junior volunteers

201
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,479
assigned to the Clinton campaigns

202
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,280
advance team

203
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,410
they finished informal Clinton campaign

204
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,869
advisors they fished the DNC employee

205
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,340
overall you had about 120 GRU officers

206
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,130
stealing tens of thousands of emails

207
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:19,390
John Podesta alone had 50 to 60 thousand

208
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:22,030
emails stolen from his email account so

209
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,770
what can you do

210
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,719
first and foremost super basic and easy

211
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,979
password managers and hardware 2fa

212
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,750
tokens I know I'm preaching to the choir

213
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,340
here this is not going to be like news

214
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,990
to anyone here I think most of the time

215
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,880
we want to do these things and the

216
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,230
bigger problem is getting organizational

217
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,180
buy-in getting resource and budget and

218
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,620
headcount and that sort of stuff but

219
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,090
this really is like probably the number

220
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,600
one most effective way to prevent this

221
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:45,280
because both of these tools when you

222
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,290
register on a particular website the

223
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,849
password manager or the hardware token

224
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:50,710
will be bound to the domain name of that

225
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,910
website and if subsequently someone

226
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,669
sends you a phishing link that is for a

227
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,740
different you know off by one character

228
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:59,740
letter then those tools simply won't log

229
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,570
you in so Brian Krebs had this article

230
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,210
posted where he looked at Google's

231
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,790
rollout of 2fa across their entire fleet

232
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:09,460
of employees at the time in 2017 it was

233
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,600
like more than 90,000 people and their

234
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,010
phishing rate fell to zero

235
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,950
they were like completely eliminated

236
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:16,539
this class of problem because you know

237
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,530
that the device won't authenticate to a

238
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:22,030
website that is not the legitimate

239
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:24,549
website and just an alert on DNS so much

240
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,169
valuable query data and passive DNS you

241
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,280
know you can look at most of the time I

242
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,080
think when employees need to get work

243
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,609
done they really are going to be using a

244
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,500
small set of websites to in their

245
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,990
day-to-day work if you have one single

246
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,190
laptop that has made one single query to

247
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,820
this domain name that you've never seen

248
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,740
before

249
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,810
you can probably alert on that maybe you

250
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,210
can join it with some intelligence data

251
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:45,310
around like this is a recently

252
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,330
registered domain or the this domain has

253
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,520
a high threat score or something like

254
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:50,500
that that's still too noisy you could

255
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,360
decide hey I'm really want to protect

256
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,650
these like five to ten domains like gee

257
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,280
sweet and octave for example I really

258
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,620
want to protect

259
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,360
two domains and so if you ever see a DNS

260
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,950
query that is like it off by one

261
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,120
character of one of those domain names

262
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,990
that you cared about that could be alert

263
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,490
worthy scan incoming emails lots of open

264
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,930
source tools to do this lots of vendors

265
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,790
that do this

266
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,349
Airbnb open sourced a tool called email

267
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,719
alert that'll just scan every incoming

268
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,410
email and run yarra rules against it so

269
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,710
that's pretty easy ingest mail audit log

270
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,880
events gee sweet office 365 others they

271
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,410
all provide an audit log that you can

272
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,810
programmatically ingest and say hey

273
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,490
someone reset their - if a token someone

274
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,530
went through a password reset flow

275
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,120
someone logged in from Russia or Egypt

276
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:34,589
or Brazil they're sitting right next to

277
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,300
me what's going on pretty valuable

278
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,440
fishing exercises question mark the

279
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,300
reason that I have a question mark here

280
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,980
I think there are some pros and cons to

281
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,859
deploying phishing exercises within your

282
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,480
company on the pro side you will without

283
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,890
a doubt systematically reduce the number

284
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,840
of employees who fall for phishing like

285
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:52,420
real phishing attacks you will without a

286
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,980
doubt systematically increase the amount

287
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,750
of employees who are reporting phishing

288
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,390
emails to you so you will have increased

289
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:00,460
visibility and also I think security has

290
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,020
a real problem with metrics and this is

291
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,140
very measurable you can you know

292
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,910
definitively say we are click-through

293
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,170
rate dropped 5% this quarter over the

294
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,189
past quarter and you can measure that

295
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,500
and you can like share it up in

296
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,420
presentations and that's great some of

297
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,950
the cons for phishing exercises

298
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,719
depending on your company culture you

299
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,360
might not be able to get buy-in to roll

300
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,250
this out some employees might feel it is

301
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,089
adversarial and it might hurt your

302
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,010
relationship with them and and also I

303
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:28,450
think you know you're never going to

304
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,280
drive this down to zero just like with

305
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,860
Charles Delavan it's like there's always

306
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,709
gonna be that one out case that one edge

307
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,910
case and so you have to assume that

308
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,310
phishing is going to happen anyway and

309
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,870
then defend against it no matter what

310
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,270
like have defense-in-depth maybe deploy

311
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,950
some sort of endpoint monitoring and see

312
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,540
suspicious process activity or see other

313
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,430
behavior and so if you're going to be

314
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,660
doing those things anyway like no matter

315
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,939
what you still have to deploy those

316
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,319
solutions then is it worth the like

317
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:56,710
mental burden that you're placing on

318
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,710
employees to think hey I'm being fished

319
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,660
by my own company right now

320
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:04,110
so you know pros and cons to this

321
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,540
approach and then there's some basic

322
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,890
like email security technologies I'm not

323
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,959
gonna go into depth on these but like

324
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,630
these first three help verify the

325
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:15,390
authenticity of email the latter to help

326
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:18,300
verify that email is encrypted in

327
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:21,270
transit and their more recent so those

328
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,589
are things that you can deploy there was

329
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,760
an interesting blog post or a few

330
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,130
interesting blog posts where they're

331
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,530
looking at the current twenty twenty

332
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:30,240
candidate campaigns and their emails and

333
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,310
so you see about like fifty percent of

334
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,630
them used Demark which if you're a glass

335
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,699
half full or glass half-empty could be

336
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,960
good or bad I think it's like decent I

337
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,130
think we're trending up it's certainly

338
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,940
more than twenty sixteen but we also

339
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,939
still have a ways to go

340
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,760
okay so we're only a month in we got

341
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,050
John Podesta fished on March 19th the

342
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,200
GRU gained access to the d-triple-c

343
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:54,209
network on April 12th using credentials

344
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,290
that they had spear fished from those

345
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,320
spear phishing emails that they've been

346
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:00,810
sending out and there's a quote on the

347
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,070
report over the ensuing weeks the jury

348
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,329
you traverse the network identifying

349
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,370
different computers connected to the

350
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,780
d-triple-c network by stealing network

351
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,130
access credentials along the way

352
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,720
including those of IT administrators

353
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,640
with unrestricted access to the system

354
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,560
the juror you compromised approximately

355
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:17,520
25 different computers on the d-triple-c

356
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,140
network so over the following weeks

357
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,280
after April 12th compromised

358
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,810
approximately 30 hosts some people may

359
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,220
not realize that the d-triple-c was

360
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,839
hacked at all or that they were hacked

361
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,000
first before the DNC but they were

362
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,040
hacked first so you might ask the

363
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,110
question how was the DNC hacked was it

364
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,959
also through spearfishing and to answer

365
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,010
that I want to take a little sidestep

366
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,260
here into the structure of the

367
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,970
Democratic Party you've got three

368
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,890
components the Democratic National

369
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,960
Committee the DNC focuses on the

370
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,000
presidential campaign and the party

371
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,010
convention the Democratic Congressional

372
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,840
Campaign Committee d-triple-c focuses on

373
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,580
the congressional races and the

374
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,710
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee

375
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,260
focuses on the Senate races and that

376
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,640
last one was not hacked to my knowledge

377
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,140
like there was no public reporting it

378
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:05,340
was hacked I'm just including it for

379
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,090
completeness so the D Triple C and DNC

380
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,130
even though they're separate

381
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:10,260
organizations they do work quite closely

382
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,660
together they work so closely together

383
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,310
that the d-triple-c had VPN

384
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,459
access into the DNC's internal network

385
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:18,660
and so that's how the GRU gained access

386
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,969
they were already on the d-triple-c

387
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:28,199
network they were able to use that VPN

388
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:30,180
to pivot into the DNC so yeah April 18th

389
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,378
a week later after getting access to the

390
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,138
d-triple-c network they were able to

391
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:35,670
pivot recommendations just don't allow

392
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,709
third-party access into your network so

393
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:42,420
easy like why why didn't they think of

394
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:44,849
that obviously I'm being a little bit

395
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,110
tongue-in-cheek here we you know as

396
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,639
security practitioners I think we all

397
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,589
received these requests of hey I just

398
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:50,970
need this thing to my do my job I don't

399
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:51,810
have like the resources to build it out

400
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,220
the right way can you just give me

401
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,560
access you're blocking me right now and

402
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,019
like you know come on so there was a

403
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,128
footnote in the report here the VPN in

404
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,509
this case had been created to give a

405
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,189
small number of d-triple-c employees

406
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:03,930
access to certain databases housed on

407
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:05,279
the DNC network which is you know

408
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,719
exactly the request that all of us

409
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,100
receive so segregate access practice

410
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,750
least privilege add monitoring all the

411
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,490
usual things I think they probably could

412
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,740
have done more to reduce the blast

413
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,029
radius here so that given the VPN access

414
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,180
like they shouldn't have been able to

415
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:22,740
pivot as far as they did and all of

416
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,599
these other practices that again are

417
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:29,850
basic standard information security

418
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,740
practices over the following weeks or

419
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,810
more than a month even they compromised

420
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,579
an additional 30 DNC hosts and then

421
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:40,380
around June 8 that is when the

422
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:41,939
compromise was officially removed so

423
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,829
install tools once they were on the

424
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:45,300
network what did they do there were four

425
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:47,339
tools called out in the report the first

426
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,560
one was called X agent it was a bespoke

427
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,630
tool not anything that you can find on

428
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,550
the Internet they wrote it for this it

429
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,230
can lock key strokes take screenshots

430
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,779
gather filesystem and operating system

431
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,459
information etc the second bespoke tool

432
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,680
that they installed was called X tunnel

433
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,180
we was used for creating an encrypted

434
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,649
tunnel for large-scale data transfers so

435
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,779
that they could exfiltrate all of that

436
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:08,759
data

437
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,350
mamie cuts if you're not familiar with

438
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,370
me cats it's a Windows credential

439
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:14,610
harvesting tool little gather

440
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:18,300
credentials from memory so that one is

441
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:19,829
open sourced WinRAR this one surprised

442
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,420
me I don't these were like the four

443
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:22,649
tools called out I don't I guess if

444
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,760
you're gonna hack the dnc you want

445
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:31,320
WinRAR to compress her files that was

446
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:34,260
one of the tools installed in terms of

447
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,550
stolen data you've got key log sessions

448
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,810
containing passwords internal

449
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,660
communications banking information

450
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,310
sensitive PII various internal strategy

451
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,890
documents fundraising data opposition

452
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,630
research emails from work inboxes

453
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:49,890
in total the exfiltrated more than 70

454
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:51,270
gigabytes and election documents I want

455
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,830
to talk a little bit about the structure

456
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,120
of the GRU thus far we've been saying

457
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,860
you know there a single entity but of

458
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,030
course they have sub teams so within the

459
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,950
report there were two units called out

460
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:01,319
one of them is called unit two six one

461
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,930
six five they primarily focused on

462
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,780
spearfishing so they wrote those email

463
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,670
templates that were used they focused on

464
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,350
building malware so the two you know X

465
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,349
agent and external they wrote the

466
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,420
bespoke piece of software and they were

467
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,400
mining Bitcoin actually they used

468
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,750
freshly minted coins to purchase some of

469
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,610
the infrastructure that was used in the

470
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,980
attacks so some of the hosting

471
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,210
infrastructure and also later for

472
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,920
disseminating information there was a

473
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:29,430
particular domain name that was

474
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,319
purchased through Bitcoin as well the

475
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,270
other unit involved unit seven four four

476
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,710
five five I'll just read this quote Oh

477
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,930
while they assisted with the release and

478
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,970
promotion of stolen materials and the

479
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,650
quote is officers from unit seven four

480
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,210
four five five separately hacked

481
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,490
computers belonging to state boards of

482
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,720
Elections secretaries of state and US

483
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,040
companies that supplied software and

484
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,040
other technology related to the

485
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,870
administration of US elections again I

486
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,760
think that the DNC really received the

487
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,230
majority of media reporting but there

488
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:00,810
were these like peripheral hacks going

489
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:02,700
on as well in terms of exfiltration and

490
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:05,609
what that looked like they were already

491
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,900
on the DNC and d-triple-c network from

492
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,879
there they reached out to so called

493
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,470
middle servers that they had stood up

494
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,150
and purchased with Bitcoin like I

495
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,069
mentioned from there they reached out to

496
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,720
I don't know what AMS stands for but

497
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,760
that was the name I think it's the

498
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,170
internal geo you name maybe but this was

499
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,000
their command and control center so this

500
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,040
was where GRU agents logged in and

501
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,130
reviewed screenshots reviewed key

502
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,959
logging sections downloaded data you

503
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,080
know locally onto their computers issued

504
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:34,100
commands to execute on the DNC Network

505
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,100
and from there I went to the GRU

506
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,140
so overall recommendations alert on mini

507
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,460
cats obviously there's a lot of things

508
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,960
you should to alert on but I think this

509
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,190
one is kind of a freebie like if you see

510
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,960
mimic cats on a production host you

511
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,960
should probably be paging engineers

512
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,080
endpoint monitoring for sure there's a

513
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,370
bunch of vendors like carbon black

514
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,929
CrowdStrike choose your favorite it

515
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,750
doesn't really matter even if you don't

516
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,490
have the resources to tune the alerts or

517
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,410
like manually do investigations or

518
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,060
whatever it's fine if you're even just

519
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,590
collecting the audit log data then it

520
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,290
can be so valuable after the fact to be

521
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,600
able to go you know historical forensic

522
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,310
analysis and say here are the exact

523
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,169
files that were accessed here the exact

524
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,490
commands that were executed even if you

525
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,960
can't make full use of those

526
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:20,220
capabilities and if you can't make full

527
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,430
use of them than even better network

528
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,020
segregation I already mentioned

529
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:26,310
intrusion detection system maybe I mean

530
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,800
every company I've ever worked at we had

531
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:30,300
an IDs been mostly false positives but

532
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,440
maybe we're not tuning it correctly like

533
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,440
maybe it could have helped hard to say

534
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,700
so overall conclusions if you look at

535
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,470
the attack vectors spearfishing for the

536
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,420
initial foothold lateral movement via

537
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,520
over privileged permissions and mini

538
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:48,090
cats pretty standard you see many things

539
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,420
in other corporate breaches many similar

540
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,580
things

541
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,260
overall recommendations practice defense

542
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,850
in depth set up to FAO and all the

543
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,360
things have been monitoring practice

544
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,860
lease privilege again nothing new is

545
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,850
well-known to all of us but I think it's

546
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,760
interesting to look at it through the

547
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:05,219
perspective and lens of this attack on

548
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,990
the 2016 election the last thing I'll

549
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,480
say is that it's pretty easy for me to

550
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,670
you know sit here an armchair judge the

551
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,020
DNC but I think that realistically a few

552
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,450
organizations can defend themselves

553
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:20,940
against the nation-state so that's our

554
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:22,230
thing to do with that I will take

555
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,750
questions if you're interested in my

556
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,400
Twitter that's my twitter also just like

557
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,100
everyone else wearing a blue wristband I

558
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,000
am hiring come talk to me outside or DM

559
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,090
me on Twitter if you're interested in

560
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,090
that

561
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:59,690
how much time do I have I really like to

562
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,100
FA or like the hardware tokens or

563
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,740
password managers I think user education

564
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,750
as good as it is and I focus a lot on

565
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,350
user education at every company that

566
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,280
I've ever worked at it's it's like that

567
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,719
thing that I mentioned where like you

568
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,399
just can't depend on getting that down

569
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,370
to a hundred percent no matter what no

570
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,480
matter how much education you put out

571
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,830
still someone's gonna click the link son

572
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:24,560
still someone's gonna like you know

573
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:25,429
execute the attachment alright I think

574
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,510
that's time if you have more questions

575
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,710
I'll just be right outside in the

576
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,550
hallway I'd love to chat about it so

577
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,550
thank you so much
