1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,520
we're security incident responders and

2
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:07,830
we face all the problems that security

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,550
Incident Response Teams face in the very

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,170
beginning stages of an incident we know

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,430
that something is going wrong we have to

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:20,160
open up an incident we have to act but

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:24,180
like all the other teams like some of

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,350
you we don't necessarily have all the

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,759
information we've got incomplete

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,199
information maybe we have one piece

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,679
missing maybe there's a bunch of things

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,170
we don't know we don't know the full

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,559
scope of the incident we don't

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,379
necessarily know what kind of incident

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,718
it is in those very early stages we

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,870
don't know which of many systems or

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,539
micro services may be affected

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,750
we don't know whom to involve of course

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,860
and if we don't know all of these things

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,649
we certainly are not going to know

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,440
whether attackers are actually present

22
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:02,280
and if so what systems are they

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,480
bothering so we know very little and in

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,799
order to figure this stuff out we have

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,170
to investigate so we get a incident

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,080
commander involved and they have to

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:18,570
start looking into the major questions

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,130
of the incident so if we don't know whom

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,240
to involve and we don't know which

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,780
systems are affected or any of these

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,170
things

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,729
it's those questions that are key and

33
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,990
they've got to start asking all of them

34
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,240
so how do they do that well they

35
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,189
communicate they're gonna open up a

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,390
conference bridge or a private chat

37
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,479
channel and start asking which systems

38
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,710
are affected and whom did involve etc

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,439
they're probably going to create an

40
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,479
email distribution list they need to in

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,240
order to communicate with other people

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:51,420
they're gonna create shared storage to

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,860
store incident artifacts or logs they're

44
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,439
going to need to invite the right

45
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,969
participants probably based on the

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,100
incident type and maybe severity they

47
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,689
have to talk to all those participants

48
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,000
and orient them as they come in make

49
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:10,079
sure they know what's going on maybe

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,270
with a conditions actions needs or can

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,260
report that's the form

52
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:17,150
we use and they're going to need to

53
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,859
create access groups in order to manage

54
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,890
access to all these resources that we've

55
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,080
been talking about they're going to

56
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:27,500
create an incident investigation

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,720
document that's where all the people are

58
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,250
contributing can come in and type in

59
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,840
their information on what they've

60
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,360
discovered that's how we work they might

61
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,430
create spreadsheets for affected systems

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:43,040
etc as well so the context switching

63
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,980
back and forth back and forth of setting

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,220
all of this up manually incurs a lot of

65
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:53,840
overhead and it's going to quickly

66
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:56,450
mentally exhaust you and it's it's going

67
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:02,120
to be very taxing as I'm sure you may

68
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:04,459
have faced so out of curiosity are there

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,630
is this already sounding familiar to

70
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,550
anybody in the audience is this

71
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:11,060
something that you've seen before okay

72
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:14,210
yeah so there's a number of us who face

73
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,300
this so I'm gonna tell you a big part of

74
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:19,940
the issue we face with this exhaustion

75
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,610
was due to that multitasking that we had

76
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,209
going on so multitasking may be fun at

77
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,080
the beginning it may be exciting but

78
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:30,740
quickly that exhaustion is going to

79
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:34,010
happen and we know now that doesn't

80
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:35,330
exist that you can't actually multitask

81
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,239
you're actually switching back and forth

82
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,890
between more than one thing your brain

83
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,920
doesn't do more than one thing actually

84
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:47,149
and so that taxes your brain a lot and

85
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,589
you're gonna be less effective at both

86
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,540
of those things and the current

87
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:55,640
neuroscience bears this out so our

88
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,040
incident commanders were busy trying to

89
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,929
answer the questions of the incident and

90
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,070
they were firing up all these documents

91
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,500
managing all these channels and the

92
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:09,230
people and found that quite taxing so on

93
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,459
top of all that how could we expect the

94
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,410
incident commanders that's us we were

95
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,560
doing this and our and our teammates how

96
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:18,529
could we expect ourselves to perform

97
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,260
well during the incident to be on point

98
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,109
to be paying attention to actively

99
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,180
answer those questions of the ensign

100
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,550
well we noticed it and we felt that it

101
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:34,190
was it was like paying a lot we wanted

102
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:37,190
to be better at it so I'm Forrest Monson

103
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,690
with me is Mark Villanova and we're just

104
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,570
part of the team that came up with a

105
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:45,860
better answer to this problem for

106
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:47,570
Netflix detection and response a little

107
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,700
bit about our approach to crisis

108
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:53,270
management and incident response in

109
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:56,570
general we want our team and the

110
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,280
incident commander to take care of all

111
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:03,430
this confusing stuff in a consistent and

112
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:06,260
familiar way we believe that as

113
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,570
participants continue to participate in

114
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,360
incidents that it builds their

115
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:15,290
confidence in the process and it also

116
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,000
makes them more effective we believe the

117
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,800
second third fourth time they get

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,640
involved we ask them to be involved with

119
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,680
us in an incident and that's important

120
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,450
because it reduces the amount of time

121
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,070
spent flailing around we want to

122
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:34,940
aggressively eliminate decisions that

123
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,680
don't matter we want to reduce our mean

124
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,950
time to assemble that's get the right

125
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,440
people engaged and get them in the room

126
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:46,330
we want to reduce our mean time to

127
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,979
stable for us time to stable is the

128
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:52,159
period of time during the active

129
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:54,409
incident until we believe that the major

130
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,520
questions of the incident have been

131
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:00,080
answered we call that stable if you're

132
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,450
familiar with the National Institute of

133
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,270
Standards and technology's NIST's stages

134
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:07,460
of incident response we call this the

135
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,169
containment phase but what that looks

136
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:14,960
like in vary depending on the incident

137
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:17,599
type so importantly we also want to

138
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,520
learn from every incident and we

139
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,979
absolutely need a system that helps us

140
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,390
to do that we want to take all these

141
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:26,060
lessons learn from each incident and

142
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,820
drive them back into the organization we

143
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:34,130
hope we're getting better at security

144
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:35,610
with every incident so for our first

145
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:39,900
attempt at this

146
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:42,300
to address these questions we bought a

147
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,938
third-party proprietary security

148
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,620
orchestration and response tool that

149
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:51,449
would give us workflows we tried a

150
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:54,270
workflow tool and we customized it to

151
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:57,530
get ourselves those workflows we added a

152
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,270
bunch of our own Python code as well and

153
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,059
there was a lot we liked about it it was

154
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,849
working for us and we learned from it

155
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,280
but ultimately we found that experience

156
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:10,680
unsatisfying because the tool wasn't

157
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:18,198
actually built to do what we wanted it

158
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:20,520
to do so we built dispatch and we

159
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,250
released it into production just a few

160
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,210
weeks ago and we're relying on it every

161
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,849
day now and we're very excited about it

162
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,560
I just wanted to come talk about it mark

163
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,270
is gonna take you through how dispatch

164
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,370
answers these questions and automates

165
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,139
away a lot of that pain we were feeling

166
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,819
he's gonna show you what that looks like

167
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:43,590
with some screenshots from a participant

168
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:45,060
experience mark thanks for us the first

169
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,128
thing that we wanted to do with this

170
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,990
patch was to standardize internal

171
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:53,190
reporting we wanted to get a move away

172
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:56,729
from getting instant reports via email

173
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,949
or like using a form that with like

174
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,330
limited functionality because we wanted

175
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:03,599
to provide a great experience to our

176
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:09,419
customers internal customers so we end

177
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:12,060
up building our own intake form it's

178
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:14,639
very simple it only requires incident

179
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,779
title and infinite description the view

180
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:21,240
as a reporter happened to know also the

181
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:23,159
incident type or in the priority that we

182
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,680
should give to these incident you can

183
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:29,909
also do so but it's not required and we

184
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,159
can always change it later once the

185
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:35,578
incident form is submitted

186
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,760
we present a reporter with this

187
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:41,069
information on your left-hand side you

188
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,870
can see the information that the

189
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,020
reported submitted to us as a

190
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,180
confirmation plus the insert commander

191
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,120
that got assigned to this incident Inc

192
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:55,109
they need a point of contact right away

193
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:58,110
on the right-hand side as resources are

194
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,420
getting created you can see them

195
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,190
displayed on your screen and then at the

196
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,680
end you get a list of all the resources

197
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:08,339
that this batch created for you such as

198
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:11,219
a JIRA ticket or like a slide private

199
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,440
conversation some storage for files an

200
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,200
investigation document investigation

201
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,700
sheet and also we usually provide a link

202
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:23,040
to our security incident FAQ in case

203
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,779
it's the first time that you participate

204
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,449
on an incident and have questions about

205
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:33,330
it this but will not only creates all

206
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:36,240
these resources for you so you as an

207
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,820
incident commander can focus on the

208
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,839
things that matter but also helps us

209
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,610
provide consistency in our process like

210
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,680
Forrest was mentioning he would also

211
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,839
manage the resources throughout the

212
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,439
lifecycle of the incident for you so you

213
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:55,080
can focus on what matters this but will

214
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,080
also add the right people based on their

215
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,300
preferences we provide an ear face for

216
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,790
people to let us know when they should

217
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,819
be engaged some people need to be on

218
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,650
every incident some people only for

219
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,100
specific types of incidents or

220
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:13,470
priorities or maybe because keyword was

221
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,330
mentioned in the title so people can go

222
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:20,610
and explicitly tell us what they should

223
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:22,770
be engaged we also can recommend on-call

224
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,160
people based on their preference the

225
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:29,459
team preferences as well this budget

226
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,800
will also page people based on the

227
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,079
severity if it's high enough it will go

228
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:39,329
and page the interim response team on

229
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:41,279
call it also notifies an incident

230
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:43,829
challenger more general incident channel

231
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,380
and distribution list these are for like

232
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:49,800
every incident and if that incident like

233
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:54,560
changes its status changes that allows

234
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:57,500
us to keep all the stakeholders informed

235
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,089
these are a couple of examples of how we

236
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,130
the notifications look like on the left

237
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:04,860
hand side you have a slug no decay

238
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:10,130
on the right hand side a similar one

239
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:13,170
that goes out via email anyone in the

240
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:15,000
incidents channel the general channel

241
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:17,300
while people can see like when there's

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,160
like new incidents going on can get

243
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,639
anyone interested in an incident get

244
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,339
Getti bought by clicking a button so on

245
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:29,009
every incident notification there's a

246
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:31,230
button that people can click to get

247
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:37,040
themselves added to the incident channel

248
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:40,019
and later to the incident when people

249
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,630
get added to the incident this fight

250
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,630
will not only add them to everything

251
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,519
that needs to be added but also provide

252
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:51,980
them with context and access to the

253
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:54,839
resources that they need this is how the

254
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,519
we call it the welcome message looks

255
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,220
like when someone gets added to an

256
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,430
incident on the left hand side you can

257
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,230
see an ephemeral message that the

258
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,870
participant gets right when they join

259
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,720
the incident channel and then on the

260
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,730
right hand side the email address that

261
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,569
email that they get with the same

262
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:20,189
information so these like accomplishes

263
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:22,170
two things one people don't need to

264
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:24,839
reach out to the incident commander to

265
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,689
ask where is the information that I need

266
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,519
to get myself up to speed and start

267
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:31,319
contributing and then freeze the

268
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,250
incident commander from doing that as

269
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:38,189
well this part will also announce

270
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:45,149
participants as days as they get added

271
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:49,019
to the incident channel we as you can

272
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:50,939
see we had we provide the name the team

273
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:55,230
the location and the role that they have

274
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:57,329
as a participant on the incident and you

275
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:00,509
some of you may have noticed that we

276
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:01,229
didn't include the job title we did that

277
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:05,449
on purpose

278
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,449
and does anyone know why we did that

279
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:14,089
we did it to avoid the power

280
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:17,120
differential executive suit problem we

281
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,310
want everyone to be at the same level

282
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,920
when responding to an incident and we

283
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,589
don't want an executive to like drop on

284
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,790
the incident channel and then steer the

285
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,450
intern to manner in a different

286
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,589
direction that they were planning to go

287
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:32,660
because the intern commander is supposed

288
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,430
to have supposed to be the person with

289
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,300
the most knowledge context about the

290
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:41,540
incident these cuts also allows you to

291
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,050
hand off the incident and also assign

292
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:48,490
roles to participants such a scribe

293
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:52,250
liaison reporter or incident commander

294
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:54,140
we use as locked dialogues to do that so

295
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,520
on the top on the left hand side you

296
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,380
have the slack dialogue where you can

297
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,870
choose the participant that you want to

298
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,280
assign the role to and then on the

299
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,890
bottom like the role that you want to

300
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,010
assign that person to once that a role

301
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:09,110
gets a sign dispatch will announce that

302
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:12,620
assignment in the channel so everyone

303
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:15,170
sees who assigned which role to who if

304
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:19,850
it's incident commander that change will

305
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:23,360
propagate to all the systems you can

306
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:26,720
also engage on-call people track with

307
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,990
with with dispatch and pitch them if you

308
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,990
want we also use slack dialogues for

309
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,970
that you can select the on-call service

310
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:38,089
that you have defining that is by do I

311
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:41,900
and you can choose whether you want to

312
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:44,270
take them or not this part also makes it

313
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,459
very easy for incident commanders and/or

314
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:50,780
scribes supporting the interim commander

315
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:53,750
to write and share status reports they

316
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:56,480
can pop up these slack dialogue that

317
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:59,330
uses they can condition conditions

318
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,240
actions and needs for Matt to write a

319
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:06,170
report and then once submitted it goes

320
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,240
to a distribution list and also gets

321
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:12,530
posted in the channel for everyone to

322
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:16,070
see dispatch also notifies about

323
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:18,920
incident tasks whether they are like new

324
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,329
tasks or pasa have been resolved it

325
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,819
creates tasks

326
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:25,248
of comments in any of the incident

327
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:31,959
documents and keep track of them on a

328
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:35,389
scheduled basis we have noticed that by

329
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:37,638
and these are the screenshots of like

330
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:40,699
how these notifications look like he

331
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:43,639
also this patch also reminds the task

332
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:46,819
owners to complete those tasks if they

333
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:49,249
haven't been completed on time we notice

334
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:51,349
that the crease in resolution time for

335
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:54,040
this task as soon as we start like

336
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:57,559
exposing them in the incident channel

337
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,540
they could be bared in a document but by

338
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,230
surfacing them in the incident channel

339
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,670
one where everyone is like communicating

340
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:09,920
allowed us to retina

341
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:12,290
reduce the resolution time this patch

342
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,628
also allows you to manage the lifecycle

343
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,410
of the incident if the risk has been

344
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:17,869
contained

345
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,389
you can mark the incident a stable if

346
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:21,529
the incident has been resolved you can

347
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:24,649
mark it as closed

348
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:26,899
it also calculates the incident cost we

349
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,869
design a cost model it's pretty simple

350
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:34,160
at this point but basically looks at how

351
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:36,799
much time people have spent trying to

352
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,160
resolve the incident and then we combine

353
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:42,259
that with an average cost per employee

354
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,529
to come up with a number that then gets

355
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:48,079
published in shared this patch is

356
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:51,470
written in Python using the fast API

357
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,019
framework reduces post casts to store

358
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:58,279
and manage data and it provides a view

359
00:16:54,019 --> 00:17:01,069
Jas based front-end it's plugin based so

360
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:07,849
you can easily extend it we have plugins

361
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:10,158
for JIRA T suite slack and pager duty so

362
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:12,230
what's in the future well we have a few

363
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:14,600
things we want to build we want to

364
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,789
continue building our recommendation

365
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:20,559
system we want to be able to recommend

366
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:23,449
people and documentation perhaps

367
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,908
previous incident documents or maybe run

368
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:27,559
books based on the information that we

369
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:30,409
know at this point during the incident

370
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:32,960
we also want to be able to timeline an

371
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:33,150
incident have all the facts and actions

372
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,980
are

373
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,550
we're taking throughout the lifecycle of

374
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:41,100
it and also provide metrics so you can

375
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,879
know like okay how many instance we had

376
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,379
this one how much they cost us how many

377
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,070
incidents are we gonna have next month

378
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:52,710
we do forecasting as well

379
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:55,590
so to summarize our instant response

380
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:58,860
process was very painful and so we built

381
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:01,980
these fights to automate it we have open

382
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,020
to dispatch today and we are hoping that

383
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,620
you're going to check it out and find it

384
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:11,910
useful feel free to send us feedback and

385
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:15,169
contribute by sending PRS and we have I

386
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,170
think time for questions

387
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:24,839
[Applause]

388
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,040
innovation answer no we don't have any

389
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,620
innovation question was whether there

390
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,440
was integration with ServiceNow yeah no

391
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,810
no but like we said it's a plug-in based

392
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,820
so you can write a plug-in for it and

393
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:44,780
submit a PR we were happy to accept

394
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,780
there's a question up there

395
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:02,930
so the question was around our treatment

396
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,399
of PII or personal information how do we

397
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,200
how do we treat that during an instance

398
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,430
to make sure that it doesn't get broader

399
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,470
exposure is that right okay cool so we

400
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:14,540
have a we have a general set of

401
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,250
protocols that we use for handling

402
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,720
personal information and yeah we

403
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,170
basically try to touch it as little as

404
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,870
possible we we couple this and then we

405
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,460
try to cross it with Netflix's freedom

406
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,169
and responsibility culture which means

407
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,360
that we do have that get involved button

408
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,130
and anybody can step into an incident so

409
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,870
at least we can see who else is involved

410
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:36,350
in the incident and talk directly to

411
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:38,360
them so I think that it's a really it's

412
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,709
mostly the responsibility that we place

413
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,790
on people as well as the regular

414
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,500
protocols that we face

415
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,060
dispatch doesn't have specific controls

416
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,590
around that yeah I think it's also worth

417
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:51,919
mentioning that the way we give access

418
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,899
to information is by when people join

419
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,000
the incident channel we captured that

420
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,100
event and then we add them to a Google

421
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,140
Group that then determines like who has

422
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,530
access to all the information so we have

423
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,480
like the Google Group in the Google

424
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,600
Drive and then all the documents there

425
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,130
so we as people come and leave we add

426
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,919
them or remove them from the Google

427
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,960
Group that way the people that we use

428
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,730
the slack channel as the suits of truth

429
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,120
of people that are involved in the

430
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,120
incident

431
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,269
where the it's open source and the

432
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:35,230
question is where is it hosted yes it's

433
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:37,869
on github yes / Netflix feisty /

434
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:41,259
dispatch sorry yeah the link is kind of

435
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:44,189
like hidden in that text there's no

436
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:44,190
question oh we're sorry

437
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,020
okay so the question was why didn't we

438
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,899
implement voice communication like an

439
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,910
automated setup of a conference bridge

440
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,170
and is that something maybe is that

441
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,690
something we're planning or have we

442
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,980
thought about yeah okay no that's a

443
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,200
that's a really cool that's a great

444
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,610
feature we just happened around our

445
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,960
culture to to centralize on slack and

446
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:18,240
even though we will jump right into a

447
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,640
situation room or in person if need be

448
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,180
and slack we found had all these

449
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,740
benefits around the chat ops

450
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,600
capabilities as well as controlling the

451
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,250
access so it's not like we wouldn't ever

452
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,990
do that we've talked about it we do have

453
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:35,370
plans to create google hangout in case

454
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,160
people need to like jump on a bridge

455
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:41,370
because that's usually if if it's a high

456
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,880
severity incident like the channel will

457
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:46,439
be very chaotic and a way to like get

458
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,920
rid of that chaos it's like getting on a

459
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,400
bridge and so and the incident commander

460
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,200
then moderate the conversation so we do

461
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,700
have plans to like incorporate dyeing

462
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,490
our clothes but we don't have it right

463
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,490
now there's no

464
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,979
[Music]

465
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:32,050
sure yeah the question was how we often

466
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,000
have to work in documents unstructured

467
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,830
documents and so how do we normalize

468
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,300
that data how do we get if we're gonna

469
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,310
create if we're gonna pull metrics out

470
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,409
and you said often the problem is you

471
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:43,210
have more than one data system well our

472
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:47,320
solution to that is that we have more

473
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:50,440
than one data system so we we use JIRA

474
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:53,080
as a way to maintain details field

475
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,660
little details about an incident and we

476
00:22:53,080 --> 00:23:00,580
do keep things in the document but we

477
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:02,860
can draw conclusions about our incidents

478
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,629
over time by pulling results from there

479
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,459
did you want to say more on that

480
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,610
yeah I just want to add that the reason

481
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,950
why we stick with Google Docs is because

482
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,840
it's what everyone at the company is

483
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,910
used to like we didn't want to go and

484
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,610
create like something new that no one

485
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:21,100
really needed knew like how to use and

486
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,570
we wanted to train them by using all the

487
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,760
tools that everyone uses that the

488
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,010
company makes the process easier more

489
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,020
familiar but yeah it's a channel

490
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:32,430
challenge we I think we're planning to

491
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:34,660
add some like tagging labeling in

492
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,200
incidents for like incidents in this

493
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:40,510
bunch

494
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,430
later but we don't have it right now we

495
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,140
have a question from slide oh might be

496
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:46,090
absurd it's um

497
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,770
how difficult was it to get the rest of

498
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:51,070
the company to use this reporting flow

499
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:55,240
and not use the old methods a question

500
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:58,480
from anonymous anonymous oh they're

501
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,680
they're looking for us so the question

502
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,940
was hi and you probably heard that

503
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,940
already was how do we get the rest of

504
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,410
the company to use it well I mean we

505
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,059
kept telling them about it I don't do

506
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:10,809
you have a better answer than No

507
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:12,460
as if they were reporting us through

508
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:15,509
different channels we would point them

509
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:18,669
to the forum and then over time like

510
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:22,899
people start using it and we don't have

511
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:25,899
to tell them anymore and it's pretty

512
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:28,389
like it's a pretty simple form it only

513
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:32,289
like we said only requires title and

514
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:36,158
description and because we don't want

515
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:38,769
people to get stuck you know form that

516
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,019
has a lot of questions when what really

517
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:43,389
matters is that we kick that incident

518
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:45,850
off and then we can figure the rest of

519
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:52,658
it later cool

520
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:53,559
last question oh okay sure mister just

521
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:58,720
curious if you ever thought about

522
00:24:53,559 --> 00:25:02,619
putting it on segregated system primary

523
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,759
infrastructure you could still do so the

524
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:06,220
question was have we thought about

525
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,320
having it on a segregated system so if

526
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,299
let's say instant response effects our

527
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,490
hosting platform where we have dispatch

528
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:16,720
will we still be able to handle an

529
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:21,450
incident doing so it is sitting in a

530
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:25,090
different AWS account Don protests and

531
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:27,789
other infrastructure so yeah security

532
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:31,240
has its own like product and trust

533
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:34,299
accounts so it leaves there yeah but if

534
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:38,470
there is a large-scale AWS collapse we

535
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:39,220
will be out of luck I think thank you

536
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,059
all very much

537
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,059
yeah thank you very much

538
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,660
[Applause]
