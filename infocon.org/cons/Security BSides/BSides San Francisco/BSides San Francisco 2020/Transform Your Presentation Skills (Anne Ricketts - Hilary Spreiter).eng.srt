1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
I'm really happy to present our speakers

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,870
we have Anne Ricketts and Hillary

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,610
spriter who are going to teach you about

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:15,450
transforming your presentation skills

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:17,580
thanks very much hi everyone Hey so as a

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,710
presentation skills coach I'm always on

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,439
the lookout for examples of great

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,840
presenters and recently I was online I

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,730
was looking for some videos and I

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,490
stumble across a video from the 1980s

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,969
and this video appeared to be of a woman

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,969
in her 80s giving a presentation and as

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,510
I watched her I was blown away first of

14
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,010
all her delivery was so confident there

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,930
was about a hundred people in the room

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,260
and she was owning it it even looked

17
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,820
like she was having fun in addition she

18
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,070
had this great connection this great

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,239
rapport with the audience even though

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,610
she was doing the majority of the

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,440
speaking it felt like a conversation she

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,160
was telling jokes getting interaction

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,709
and then finally her content was so

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,209
simple and clear she was giving a

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,729
technical presentation to a

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,530
non-technical audience and to make this

27
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,090
idea understandable she had this prop

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,610
this piece of wire she's holding in her

29
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,390
hand and this analogy that she was using

30
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,380
it was super easy and engaging do any of

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,299
you know who this is

32
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,060
she knows the Grace Hopper Grace Hopper

33
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,290
and what do you know about her you can

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,250
yell it out what are some things you

35
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,689
know about her

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:30,270
what's that Cobalts okay bugs yeah she

37
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,658
was a she was a lieutenant crown yeah

38
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,520
she was a very impressive lady and a

39
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,200
pioneer in computer science and I knew

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,329
some of those things but until I saw

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,430
this video I had no idea that in

42
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,130
addition she was this fabulous presenter

43
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,829
and watching grace got me thinking about

44
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,420
what she was doing in the 80s compared

45
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,869
to what we often do today in

46
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,850
presentations today this scenario is not

47
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,100
super uncommon for internal

48
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,259
presentations I'm sure you all see

49
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,329
presentations all the time what do you

50
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,659
notice about presentations today that is

51
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,869
not engaging

52
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:08,310
powerpoints okay laptops yeah so if the

53
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,190
audience is on your laptop when you're

54
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,180
presenting that's difficult

55
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,549
we've got PowerPoint maybe a lot of text

56
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,650
the PowerPoint and as the results you

57
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:20,260
have this loss of connection with with

58
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,760
the audience and we can recognize when

59
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,459
other people are doing that that it's

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,959
not great but when it's our turn we do

61
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,510
the same thing because we think well

62
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,430
that's how everyone's doing it well not

63
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,290
anymore in the next 50 minutes we really

64
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,629
want to go back and master the

65
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,040
essentials of a previous time and the

66
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,018
way that we're gonna do that is we've

67
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,319
got three topics we call these the three

68
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:43,750
C's of effective presentations first

69
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:46,480
we're going to talk about confidence how

70
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,980
to look and feel more confident how many

71
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,418
of you could benefit from feeling more

72
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,750
confident when speaking in front of a

73
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,250
group okay I see a lot of hands yeah

74
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,280
then we'll talk about various techniques

75
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,200
to build connection and then finally

76
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,700
we'll talk about a few ways that you can

77
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,548
make sure that your message you have

78
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,399
clarity that it's clear and simple and

79
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:08,019
our goal is that if you're presenting

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,459
later today or tomorrow at the

81
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,680
conference you've got something coming

82
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,269
up this week you can immediately use

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,870
these techniques to be a more effective

84
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,620
presenter before we go further my name

85
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,940

Hillary spriter I'm also a communication

92
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:33,790
professionals around the bay area who

93
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,099
are working on developing their

94
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,810
presentation skills I'm also a

95
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,238
communication coach at the business

96
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,949
school at Stanford University I get to

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,729
work with a set of the students there to

98
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:47,229
help with their speaking and writing

99
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:49,540
great let's talk about confidence first

100
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:51,359
and as we talk about confidence there's

101
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,638
two pieces that we're gonna discuss

102
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:57,040
there's the external how you show up and

103
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:59,019
there's the internal how you feel both

104
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,720
are really important I want to start

105
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,909
with external I'm gonna show you a clip

106
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,859
in a moment of somebody who my team

107
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:08,679
worked with and I want you to see how

108
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,659
the smallest weeks the smallest changes

109
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,849
in delivery can make a really big game

110
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:15,819
impact and how confident when you come

111
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:17,889
across this speaker is named Lucas and

112
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:20,289
he's a technical director at the company

113
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:24,810
Unity Technologies so let's take a look

114
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:24,810
in the first clip is before any coaching

115
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:37,030
do we have audio one second we'll get

116
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:41,010
audio in this clip I should speak up oh

117
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:45,150
he should speak up yep voice is too low

118
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,150
there's one second here we'll go back

119
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,450
and I should mention so Lucas is a

120
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,790
non-native English speaker and didn't

121
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,900
want to do these keynotes but everyone

122
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,730
at the company thought he was pretty

123
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,289
good so now all of us in every quarter

124
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,180
he's having to speak in front of this

125
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,780
live streamed audience hundreds of

126
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,310
people in the room quite a big deal

127
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:16,630
we're good okay let's try it again here

128
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:21,880
we go Lucas before coaching I think it

129
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:24,130
should have sound I could stick with us

130
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,310
for these demos because we have a lot of

131
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,690
demos to run through so the next version

132
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,240
of unity that we're going to ship is

133
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,490
five five we've been cooking on it for

134
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,650
quite some time already and as usual you

135
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,350
can get the latest beta version from our

136
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:41,440
website today all right now let's look

137
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,700
at after coaching not that long by the

138
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,029
way about an hour

139
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,029
[Music]

140
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:56,310
everybody let's have some fun I'm gonna

141
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,530
show you see today I'm gonna show you

142
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,780
how a scene was made and when I first

143
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,299
saw this scene I didn't really believe

144
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,479
it was put together in a few days let's

145
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,090
take a look I have it open here on my in

146
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,100
my unity editor in Maschine view and the

147
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,859
first thing that you will see is that I

148
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,210
have a whole okay what differences you

149
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,250
can yell it out what differences do you

150
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:22,799
notice hopefully you got to see clip 1

151
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:23,940
versus clip 2 the stands confident and

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,220
tell me more how does he look more

153
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:31,560
confident happy to be there yeah he's

154
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,360
his posture is better and he's not in

155
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,190
the first clip he's just pacing around

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,650
aimlessly in the second clip we put a

157
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,969
little piece of tape on the stage to try

158
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,440
to get him to ground and it took him a

159
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,640
minute to get there but then he settled

160
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,560
in any other differences you notice

161
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,930
storytelling yeah he's making eye

162
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,700
contact instead of looking aimlessly

163
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,100
around he just looked at a few people in

164
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,060
the audience so that wasn't that much by

165
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,390
the way everyone thinks he got a

166
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:01,080
makeover we did not do that but just a

167
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:03,210
little bit made a big difference let's

168
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,580
go over some of the fundamentals of

169
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,020
delivery that we teach people like Lucas

170
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,099
I'm gonna ask you all to stand up we're

171
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,789
gonna do this together

172
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,790
stand up

173
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,688
if we want to look confident we actually

174
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,270
have to do that physically so we need to

175
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:26,090
ground our feet and that means feet hip

176
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,580
distance apart and weight even on both

177
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,438
feet we call this the ready position

178
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,169
because it's signalling that we're ready

179
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:35,900
to engage with our audience as much as

180
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:37,938
possible try not to shift your weight

181
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,758
from leg to leg but just try that shift

182
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:43,490
from leg to leg now this might feel good

183
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,289
for you but for the audience this will

184
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,509
look a little what what does this look

185
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:51,620
like when I'm here yeah and maybe

186
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:56,030
annoyed wishy-washy ungrounded yeah off

187
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:58,610
balance so just learn to stand even now

188
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,770
another thing often people will do to

189
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,659
self-soothe is will sway back and forth

190
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,250
just try swing feels pretty good right

191
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:06,680
you might not even know you're doing it

192
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,300
for the audience I can actually make you

193
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,060
feel seasick after a couple of minutes

194
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,340
of this so again try not to sway and

195
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,840
then the third thing we see a lot of is

196
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,429
that people will get very restless and

197
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,590
that extra energy will leak out and

198
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,779
they'll begin to dance so unless dance

199
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:25,250
me as part of your presentation stand

200
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:27,409
still so it is okay to move across your

201
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,479
speaking space as long as you do so for

202
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:30,979
a reason with a purpose and you can just

203
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:32,630
connect to someone on the other side let

204
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:34,789
your eye contact guide your movement

205
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:35,510
walk over to them and then stop and

206
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:38,179
ground again

207
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:41,149
and repeat that so from the hips down

208
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:43,689
very still hands what do we want to be

209
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:47,000
doing with our hands

210
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,070
yes gesturing so when we're with our

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,930
friends and family and we feel relaxed

212
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,490
our hands are just moving I don't have

213
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,489
to teach any of you how to gesture

214
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,290
because you do it all day long but when

215
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,209
we're self conscious and we get nervous

216
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,579
we tend to do strange things with our

217
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:04,729
hands we might hide them behind our back

218
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:07,969
we shove them in pockets or we cross our

219
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,350
arms across our our fronts and this does

220
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,470
not look confident it doesn't look

221
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,720
engaging so the key is as soon as we

222
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,339
begin to speak move your hands and a

223
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,899
nice thing you can do just do it with me

224
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,850
connect out to your audience as you

225
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:22,220
begin to say your first words a

226
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,140
connecting movement once you're warmed

227
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,170
up and your gestures are going you can

228
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,480
begin to use them as

229
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,399
visual aids so you could say it's a

230
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,380
massive opportunity let's do this make

231
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,170
sure your gesture is matching the words

232
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,910
it's a massive opportunity yeah go even

233
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,680
bigger if I say it's a massive

234
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,510
opportunity you won't believe me because

235
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,180
this doesn't look massive so go massive

236
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,939
its massive and then it's tiny tiny

237
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,859
widget yes or maybe if I call it

238
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,870
climbing the tallest mountain I'll do it

239
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,760
really high would you believe me if I

240
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,190
said I climbed the tallest mountain

241
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,560
today No so you gotta make the gesture

242
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,290
match the word and if you're doing

243
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:01,079
comparisons you can say consider a and

244
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:04,639
then B do that it was before and now we

245
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:08,399
have the after so keep the hands moving

246
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:10,529
next we have eye contact how long do you

247
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:16,110
think is a perfect amount of time to

248
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:18,269
make eye contact with someone one second

249
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,100
would look like this how does this look

250
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:22,500
I'm talking to you here and this is

251
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,240
about a second of eye contact how do I

252
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,790
look

253
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,399
yeah nervous and scared so we need to

254
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,110
slow things down when I'm scanning over

255
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,510
the audience like this I'm actually

256
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,920
boosting my own anxiety because I'm

257
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,300
sending a signal to my brain that

258
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,660
there's something scary out there

259
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,819
so we need to slow it down three to five

260
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,439
seconds they say is the ideal amount of

261
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,860
time to have someone really feel that

262
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,810
you've connected with them the advantage

263
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,279
of slowing our eye contact down not only

264
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,829
does our audience feel that the speaker

265
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,930
actually really connected with us but it

266
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:58,560
sends a signal to our brain that it's

267
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,529
okay to relax and so they're a double

268
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,719
bonus so if our feet very still our

269
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,699
hands are moving we're making meaningful

270
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,069
connection to our audience and then the

271
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:10,620
fourth thing we consider is our volume

272
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:13,140
and when we coach we use a scale of 1 to

273
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,199
5 one would be a inaudible whisper you

274
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,300
couldn't hear me 2 would be always like

275
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:20,449
this the person next to me could hear me

276
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,189
but it doesn't work for public speaking

277
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:26,279
because there's no breath to project my

278
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,980
voice then there's volume 3 which is

279
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:31,740
conversational volume many of us get

280
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,870
stuck in this volume but it's not quite

281
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,209
enough it's only good enough to get to

282
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:39,030
the people immediately close to us but

283
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:40,650
not beyond so when we're public

284
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,470
speaking we need to boost up the volume

285
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,569
to what we call volume four I take deep

286
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,000
breaths so I can project my voice the

287
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,220
person furthest away can hear me easily

288
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,010
so there's no effort from the audience

289
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,350
this part you can just enjoy the volume

290
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,300
and then volume five would be shouting

291
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,370
no one likes me shouted out so do not

292
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,949
shout at your audience but we're gonna

293
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,540
go for volume four in our presentation

294
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,140
so now we're gonna put this all to

295
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:10,079
practice all together so feet hip

296
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,930
distance apart weight even on both feet

297
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,360
we're gonna do a few gestures we're

298
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,849
gonna do a big gesture and we're gonna

299
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,160
say the fun phrase mama lo pop low at

300
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,550
volume four let's try it all together

301
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,060
mam low pop low mama low and then take

302
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,300
it to your heart

303
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:30,750
Momo Pablo Pablo Pablo and then maybe

304
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,870
emphasize mama lo Popolo mama lo Pablo

305
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,970
yes fantastic so you can take your seats

306
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:40,710
thank you those are some technique we

307
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:43,200
use thank you to look and sound more

308
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,940
confident but then and I neither

309
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,690
encourage you it who's presenting later

310
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,550
on today anyone anyone still to present

311
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,830
not too many okay in your next

312
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,349
presentations think of these techniques

313
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,970
to look and sound more confident now we

314
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:00,840
want to think about the internal

315
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:03,240
confidence hands up again any of you get

316
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,940
nervous when you present either before

317
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,310
or jeering yes everybody it's totally

318
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,800
normal so there are lots of techniques

319
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,140
that we teach to help people manage

320
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,150
their anxiety but for today I'm just

321
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,860
going to choose three of my favorites

322
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:21,449
the first is tell yourself I got this

323
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,310
you are all highly accomplished people

324
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,110
many of you have moved from other

325
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,209
countries you've learned other languages

326
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,280
you are all experts on information

327
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:32,490
security so these are things that are

328
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,310
much more complicated than presenting so

329
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,250
do not stress about all the things that

330
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:40,709
could possibly go wrong when you present

331
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,930
instead remind yourself of all your

332
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,570
amazing past accomplishments and tell

333
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,689
yourself I got this let's do it all

334
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,260
together I've got this I got one more

335
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,470
time

336
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,920
I got this

337
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:58,699
it really works second thing is to

338
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,219
breathe now when we're nervous most of

339
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:04,248
us get stuck in a short shallow fast

340
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,139
chest breath and that elevates our own

341
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:09,410
anxiety and makes our voice sound a

342
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:13,249
little thin and bruffey so when you

343
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:16,399
present learn to take long slow deep

344
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:18,920
breaths they automatically calm down the

345
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,649
nervous system and the added benefit is

346
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,410
that we can support and maintain our

347
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:26,269
volume for so we're gonna do this

348
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,118
together by putting our hands on our

349
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:31,670
stomachs we're gonna take three rounds

350
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,889
of in-and-out and as you inhale you

351
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:37,269
should feel your stomach expand with

352
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:39,879
that full breath so let's do it inhale

353
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:45,999
and then exhale

354
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:53,629
twice more big long inhale exhale and

355
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:55,220
once more inhale and exhale whoo yeah I

356
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:58,009
just wanted to add this seems like

357
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,230
something that's obvious breathe but as

358
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:01,910
Hilary said we noticed when our clients

359
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,589
are nur our selves when we're nervous we

360
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,540
forget to breathe so one of the things

361
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:08,360
that we like to teach in our workshops

362
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:09,618
is that critical moment right before you

363
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,230
start and you launch into your

364
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:14,660
presentation take a moment breathe take

365
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,249
a look at everybody and then start if

366
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,749
you have that moment of breath right

367
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:22,730
before you launch in it's really gonna

368
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:25,879
help you the third thing is focus on the

369
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,410
friendly faces the folks who are leaning

370
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:29,959
in to listen to your presentation who

371
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:33,290
are smiling and and obviously engage

372
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:35,899
with their with your content how many of

373
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,998
you though would focus on will call him

374
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:39,829
mr. grumpy in the front row any hands up

375
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:41,540
any of you get distracted by people who

376
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:45,888
look like this in your audiences yes I

377
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:47,238
see quite a few hands up so those of you

378
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,350
who have your hands up what might be

379
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,790
some of the things you're telling

380
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:55,129
yourself as you're looking at this

381
00:15:49,790 --> 00:16:00,139
fellow in the front row what do I do

382
00:15:55,129 --> 00:16:02,029
this dog you what else yes he looks

383
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,520
annoyed you might be saying oh my gosh

384
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:05,260
she's judging me you think

385
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,500
I mean terrible presenter he's gonna rip

386
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:11,140
me apart in QA but we don't know this

387
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,820
poor fellow might have indigestion he

388
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,439
might be thinking about some argument he

389
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,080
just had or this might just be his

390
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,270
relaxed expression so do not take your

391
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,240
time up worrying and making up stories

392
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,740
that might not be true instead focus on

393
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,440
the folks who are obviously engaging

394
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,680
with your content so those are our three

395
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,440
very effective tips tell yourself I got

396
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,120
this practice on your long slow deep

397
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:39,220
breath and focus on the friendly faces

398
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,980
great so we talked about some ways that

399
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,870
you can look and feel more confident and

400
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,180
our second topic is how to build

401
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,470
connection and Hilary mentioned one of

402
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,359
the techniques that's very effective

403
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,820
which is that sustained eye contact

404
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,100
three to five seconds makes it feel like

405
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,960
you're having a conversation and I want

406
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,240
to focus on a few other techniques you

407
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,770
can use to build connection to

408
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,750
demonstrate this I want to show you a

409
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,730
clip of a speaker who's not particularly

410
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,829
connecting with his audience and then a

411
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,349
speaker who is and afterwards we'll talk

412
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:11,708
about the differences that we see this

413
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:13,929
first clip is Elon Musk he's speaking at

414
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:15,459
a conference in 2016 and I show this not

415
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,780
to make fun that the things that we're

416
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:20,670
seeing him do is something that's very

417
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,670
very common so let's take a look

418
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,668
all right to help welcome everyone and

419
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,879
I'm gonna talk more about about what it

420
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:37,240
takes to become multiplier of species

421
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:38,980
and I just a just a brief refresher on

422
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,950
why this is important I think

423
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,870
fundamentally the future is vastly more

424
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,399
exciting and interesting if we're a

425
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,070
spacefaring civilization and a

426
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:50,110
multi-planet species than if we're not

427
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,158
it you want to be inspired by things you

428
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,840
want to wake up in the morning you think

429
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:55,419
the future is gonna be great

430
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,730
and that's what what bring his face by

431
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:59,529
exhalation is all about it's about

432
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,940
believing in the future and thinking

433
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:03,879
that the future would better than the

434
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,710
past and I can't think of anything more

435
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:11,350
exciting than going out there and being

436
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:16,169
among the stars that's why all right do

437
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:33,370
you feel connected okay why not

438
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:34,450
okay okay so it kind of choppy a little

439
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,600
bit all the way back there you want to

440
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,600
yell out

441
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:46,269
yeah he's and he's talking about space

442
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:47,769
right this is really exciting even says

443
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:50,080
I can't think of anything more exciting

444
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:52,720
than being amongst the Stars but he's

445
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,039
saying it very flatly and he's also not

446
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,169
getting off to a very good start in

447
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:58,120
terms of his content he's got lovely we

448
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:00,340
call lovely bunch of words doesn't

449
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,979
really mean anything like hey happy to

450
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:06,250
be here good but not not anything of

451
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,990
meaning now let's contrast that with the

452
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,519
speaker his name is Louie von Ahn he's

453
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,529
the technical presenter and let's take a

454
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,940
look at some techniques that he's using

455
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:14,940
to connect in his introduction

456
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,379
how many of you have to fill out some

457
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,460
sort of web form where you've been asked

458
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,470
to read a distorted sequence of

459
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,990
characters like this how many of you

460
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:28,400
found it really really annoying ok

461
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,400
outstanding so I invented that

462
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,290
or I was one of the people who did it

463
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,610
that thing is called a CAPTCHA and the

464
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,960
reason is there's to make sure that you

465
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,490
the entity filling out the form are

466
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,810
actually a human and not some sort of

467
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,280
computer program that was written to

468
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,929
submit the form millions and millions of

469
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,970
times the reason it works is because

470
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,290
humans at least nonvisually impaired

471
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,790
humans have no trouble reading these

472
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,620
distorted squiggly characters whereas

473
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,389
computer programs simply can't do it as

474
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,949
well yet so for example in the case of

475
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,570
Ticketmaster the reason you have to type

476
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,310
these distorted characters is to prevent

477
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,689
scalpers from writing a program that can

478
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,550
buy millions of tickets two at a time

479
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:59,170
now CAPTCHAs are used all over the

480
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,610
internet and since they're used so often

481
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,170
a lot of times the precise sequence of

482
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,600
random characters that are shown to the

483
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:07,440
user is not so fortunate so this is an

484
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,490
example from the Yahoo registration page

485
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,710
random characters that happen to be

486
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,630
shown to the user where W AIT which of

487
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,940
course spell a word but the best part is

488
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:19,050
the message that the Yahoo help desk got

489
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:19,050
about twenty minutes later

490
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,070
this person thought they needed way this

491
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:30,699
of course is not a bad as this poor

492
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,700
person who

493
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:38,010
okay now all right

494
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:40,780
how is he connecting what's he doing

495
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:44,980
he's saying you okay so he's making an

496
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:49,740
audience focused humor shared

497
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:53,380
experiences self-aware II I made a beta

498
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,150
he's he knows that what he his invention

499
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,430
is annoying to some people he's got some

500
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,010
humor lots of things that he's doing to

501
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:02,590
connect he also seems happy to be there

502
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,690
he's got some passion and enthusiasm if

503
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:09,550
we were coaching him what would we tell

504
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:11,320
him to do hilary slow down louie just

505
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,240
slow down a little bit but so many

506
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,950
things that he's doing to build

507
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,620
connection and I want to highlight two

508
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:21,670
too that you can use the first one is

509
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:23,500
dive right in with a story instead of

510
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:26,050
starting off with your name and your

511
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,690
agenda and you're happy to be here

512
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:31,000
cut all that and dive right in with a

513
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,310
story that's related to your topic if

514
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,140
you do that not only will you feel more

515
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,340
confident because your content is

516
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,560
interesting and you'll notice the

517
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,470
audience is giving you more engagement

518
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,270
more eye contact but your audience is

519
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,260
really going to understand why they

520
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,850
should listen to you they're

521
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,530
understanding why this topic is

522
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,629
important what your connection is with

523
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,970
the topic so it's a really great way to

524
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,700
start for example do you remember how

525
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,110
Hillary and I started today we dove

526
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,230
right in with the story to remember what

527
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:00,850
the story's about Grace Hopper yeah so

528
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,280
that was our that was our method to do

529
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:06,070
this the other way that you can build

530
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,460
connection is to use what's called vocal

531
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:12,580
variety vocal variety is when you've got

532
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:15,910
some feeling in your voice some pausing

533
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:19,810
some punch and words rather than that

534
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:21,610
dreaded monotone delivery and vocal

535
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:24,639
variety creates connection because one

536
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:27,159
of all first of all it creates it helps

537
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,360
the audience understand the emotion that

538
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,830
you're feeling and emotions are

539
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,659
contagious if you're excited we're

540
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,250
excited if you have a sense of urgency

541
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,520
about something we have a sense of

542
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:40,810
urgency and second it clues it just is

543
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:42,820
more exciting to listen to so I want to

544
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,159
show you we took a quote for my beloved

545
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,899
Grace Hopper

546
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,960
and we marked it up so that you could

547
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,030
visualize vocal variety we put words in

548
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,690
blue that we would put a little emphasis

549
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:57,600
on we put words in blue and capped words

550
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:00,390
that we would really emphasize we put a

551
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,030
slash mark for a pause and a double

552
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,320
slash mark for a big pause so Hillary's

553
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,660
going to read this to you first without

554
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,060
vocal variety and then with so that you

555
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,750
can hear the difference so with no

556
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:14,580
variety it would sound and no pausing a

557
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,620
ship in port is safe but this is not

558
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,010
what ships are built for sail out to sea

559
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:24,080
and do new things when I begin to pause

560
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:27,740
and emphasize pop the key words it

561
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:31,070
sounds like this a ship in port is safe

562
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:36,390
but this is not what ships are built for

563
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:38,850
sail out to sea and do new things much

564
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,680
better the second right yeah a lot of

565
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,810
times we have these key messages and our

566
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,580
presentations because but because we're

567
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,879
delivering it like Hillary did in the

568
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:50,340
first round your audience doesn't really

569
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,990
get it we want you to practice this so

570
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,379
with the person next you want were you

571
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:58,230
to read it with vocal variety mm-hmm and

572
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,490
then get some feedback is there anything

573
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,170
you could do to add a little bit more

574
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:04,020
emphasis more feeling and then do it

575
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:05,960
again so you each do it two times will

576
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,990
give you about four minutes to do this

577
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,990
go ahead

578
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,990
sorry

579
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:56,849
together how was that

580
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:59,609
doing vocal variety good great this is a

581
00:25:56,849 --> 00:26:01,320
you can visualize if you have a script

582
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:02,849
or maybe you've got a couple key points

583
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,678
that you want to emphasize in a

584
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:06,649
presentation I like to mark it up this

585
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,779
way this really helps me as I rehearse

586
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:12,529
now let's get you to practice with a

587
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:14,429
topic that you're excited about and we

588
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:17,099
thought that some of you might be

589
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:18,629
presenting at the conference later today

590
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:20,249
or tomorrow but it doesn't sound like

591
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:23,039
many of you are but maybe you could

592
00:26:20,249 --> 00:26:25,200
think about security or your work what

593
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,999
you do your your team at your company

594
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,349
what are you passionate about so what

595
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:30,989
you're gonna do is with a new partner

596
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:33,869
you're gonna share your excitement for

597
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:35,369
that topic in a few sentences for

598
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:38,849
example let's say Hillary is my partner

599
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:41,009
I could say something like I'm excited

600
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:42,710
to present at B sides because when

601
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:45,330
people present they get really nervous

602
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,249
so if I can give them one or two tips to

603
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:50,070
make them feel better that's really

604
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:52,499
satisfying then she's gonna tell me on a

605
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,479
scale of one to ten how convinced she is

606
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:56,369
well it's pretty good so I'm gonna give

607
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:59,129
you an eight point five okay it's

608
00:26:56,369 --> 00:27:00,718
probably more like a seven if she's

609
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:03,509
being honest and I'll do it again and

610
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:05,460
then switch see really each go two times

611
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:11,479
and then switch so we'll give you five

612
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:11,479
minutes to do this please partner

613
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,789
four more minutes

614
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:19,710
and let's come back was it easier to do

615
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:23,910
vocal variety when you're talking about

616
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:25,800
your own work versus a quote yeah I'd

617
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:28,200
like to get a volunteer to come up on

618
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:32,790
stage and do it if we have a do have a

619
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,230
handheld mic we could use and do talk

620
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,780
about their work with some vocal variety

621
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:45,980
does anybody want to come up okay yeah

627
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,620

00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:22,580
choose a career right this is probably

656
00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:23,899
the best time to actually get into

657
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,750
InfoSec because you have a lot of new

658
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:28,699
people a lot of diversity and I wanted

659
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,980
to introduce him not only that but what

660
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,779
he really wants to specialize in is the

661
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,120
legal aspect of site cyber security

662
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:37,070
policy in law so I brought him here so I

663
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,809
can introduce him to the FF there's

664
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,740
anybody out there from the FF please

665
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:41,740
come down here talk to me

666
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:48,560
[Applause]

667
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:51,290
that was great he had some emphasis and

668
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,429
words he was gesturing I got the emotion

669
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:56,149
that you're happy to have your son here

670
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:58,460
nice job nice job okay so to summarize

671
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:00,470
the connection piece there's lots of

672
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,780
ways to connect but two very effective

673
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:04,940
ways are to use some vocal variety and

674
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:11,779
to dive into your presentation with a

675
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:15,168
relevant story we've talked about how to

676
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,429
look sound and feel more confident and

677
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:18,620
then Ann was telling us about the

678
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,540
importance of connecting we're gonna

679
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,060
move on to our last topic which is

680
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,009
clarity how to make your content clear

681
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:28,190
and concise so it's easy for your

682
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:30,110
audience to understand as communication

683
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,330
coaches and and I hear a lot about three

684
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:34,550
common pitfalls when it comes to

685
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:38,149
people's content in presentations and

686
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:41,270
meetings the first one that we hear a

687
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:43,399
lot of is that there's no clear point so

688
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,168
by the end of someone's presentation we

689
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:47,210
understand the topic we have some new

690
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:50,389
information but we're not sure of the

691
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:53,000
main take away the second pitfall is

692
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:56,389
that there is too much information

693
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,490
presented so the audience ends up

694
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:00,799
feeling overwhelmed and they go home not

695
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:03,830
actually remembering that much of what

696
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,900
they heard and then the third pitfall we

697
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:09,410
hear of a lot is that the information

698
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,670
wasn't relevant or if it was relevant to

699
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,100
the audience the presenter didn't

700
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,210
actually connect the dots so people go

701
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,549
home and they don't really know what to

702
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:19,430
do with all the information that they

703
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,980
just took on so we've come up with a

704
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:23,839
tool called the focus questions you

705
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,390
should have a piece of paper in front of

706
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:29,210
you if you don't have one we'll e-mail

707
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:31,250
you one afterwards but it's a tool that

708
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,650
we give our clients our clients love

709
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:36,170
this they answer these focus questions

710
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:38,900
before they begin to create any content

711
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:40,610
if you use these focus questions you'll

712
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,890
be amazed at how much more clear and

713
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:45,320
concise your content is you will come

714
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:47,089
across as a more articulate speaker and

715
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,120
it will save you a ton of time and

716
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:51,710
energy so I highly recommend them for

717
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,930
times sake right now I'm just gonna

718
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,700
highlight four of the points on here and

719
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:58,970
the first one is number three the

720
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,600
relevance how is your information going

721
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,700
to Benna

722
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,620
fit your audience and remember that

723
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:06,230
people are most interested in the things

724
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,700
that matter to them so the first thing

725
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,620
you have to do is make sure you've

726
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,390
considered your audience's needs and

727
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:14,180
interests and make sure your content

728
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:16,960
actually is relevant to them and then

729
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:20,180
the second thing is to explicitly state

730
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,970
how your audio your information is

731
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,980
relevant to the audience don't assume

732
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:27,649
that the audience understands it

733
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,450
implicitly connect the dots for them so

734
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:32,420
make the relevance and explicit

735
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:35,060
statement in your introduction let's

736
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,320
move down to number seven emotions how

737
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,600
are you going to get your audience to

738
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,400
feel something and what do you want them

739
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:44,900
to feel do you want them to feel excited

740
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,600
or inspired or scared and was talking

741
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,040
about the variety in the vocal quality

742
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,589
that's important to keep the audience

743
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,330
engaged and if you think of the

744
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,820
presentations you listen to that are the

745
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:58,670
most engaging you'll probably realize

746
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:02,000
that it's the presentation that makes

747
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:03,620
you feel a variety of emotions so the

748
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,240
stand-up comedians have a fun demonic

749
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,850
it's called make them laugh make them

750
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,770
cry make them laugh say goodbye puts the

751
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,940
audience to this nice rollercoaster a

752
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,980
variety of emotions

753
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,320
now as presenters we don't necessarily

754
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,690
have to make our audiences laugh but we

755
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:21,350
do want our audiences to feel contrast

756
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:22,880
in the emotions as we present if you do

757
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:25,370
this if you get your audience actually

758
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,150
feeling something viscerally they will

759
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:31,490
remember you and your content much more

760
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:33,590
so make them feel something if I can add

761
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:35,509
here and work presentations it's so come

762
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:37,850
that contrast is usually the pain of a

763
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:41,480
problem contrasted with the excitement

764
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:43,730
the relief of a solution yeah number

765
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,670
eight what is your insight your fresh

766
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,350
perspective on your topic we're often

767
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,810
asked well what do we do when we have an

768
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,549
audience who are already expert in what

769
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:56,600
I'm presenting on how do I keep them

770
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:59,960
engaged come up with a new metaphor or

771
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:03,110
analogy to put a fresh feel into the

772
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:05,330
topic tell a personal anecdote to put

773
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:07,580
your own personal touch on to the topic

774
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:10,160
but come up with something new a new

775
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:12,290
fresh perspective it can take a lot of

776
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,810
time to come up with these insights but

777
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,960
the payoff

778
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:18,090
was really big if you do and then the

779
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:20,970
final one number nine is what is your

780
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:23,040
main message if you want your audience

781
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,609
to understand your main message you have

782
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,790
to know it first I like to write it down

783
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:31,680
make sure your main message is concise

784
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:33,180
most of us have a hard time being

785
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,089
concise it's much easier to be

786
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:38,370
long-winded but again if you take the

787
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:41,040
time to write down a clear concise main

788
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:42,930
message include it in your content your

789
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,759
presentation is gonna land much more

790
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:48,779
powerfully and again it's gonna be more

791
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:51,570
memorable so use these focus questions

792
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:54,210
they're really helpful save you a ton of

793
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:57,180
time and energy and we're gonna get a

794
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:59,070
copy yeah I'll email them out and it's a

795
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:02,129
fillable PDF so you can use in the

796
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,990
future just just fill it out yeah so as

797
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,970
well as our content being clear and

798
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:07,709
concise and relevant we also want to

799
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:11,490
consider how our slides are

800
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:13,590
communicating for us many of us put on

801
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,209
way too much information on our slides

802
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,980
and they actually end up overwhelming

803
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:19,220
and confusing our audiences more than

804
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,360
they help them understand our content

805
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,129
the thing to remember is that every

806
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,290
single little thing you put on a slide

807
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,540
is demanding part of your audience's

808
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:30,620
attention so anything that is not

809
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,700
actually communicating meaning remove it

810
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:35,640
that includes extraneous information

811
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:37,910
like diagrams you don't reference words

812
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,740
that are too small you can't read

813
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:44,250
decorative backgrounds take all of that

814
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:46,350
what we call noise off the slide so that

815
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:49,380
you have a really clear signal coming

816
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:54,870
through we have an example of a noisy

817
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:57,180
slide here it is noisy slide I like you

818
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,830
to turn to your neighbor take a minute

819
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,560
and just brainstorm how would you make

820
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:04,529
this slide less noisy so there's a clear

821
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:08,870
message coming through take a minute and

822
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,870
I'll wave my hands when I want you back

823
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:53,010
come back I'd love to hear some of your

824
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:55,980
thoughts what do you think why they're

825
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:58,140
all the words yes so first thing to do

826
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,300
would be to critically think of your

827
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:03,480
content you can see these messages are

828
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:05,940
slightly different it's ambiguous so now

829
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,710
I'm confusing you with two messages so

830
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,810
instead think critically what is the

831
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:17,960
main message and write it on your slide

832
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:21,420
what other thing would you do yes hmm

833
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:34,320
how might you convey a percentage more

834
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:36,330
effective yeah yeah yeah so maybe a

835
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,880
whole different visual would set this up

836
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:41,870
more effectively other things other

837
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,870
suggestions you came up with

838
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,910
yeah there's extra information yes and

839
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,650
also consider your audience's needs you

840
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,690
do the audience is the audience really

841
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,700
gonna remember all eight data points and

842
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,490
if they're not gonna remember them why

843
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,230
are you showing it so maybe make it less

844
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:03,140
information yeah there is another hand

845
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,760
up over here yes

846
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,440
yeah the background sucks get rid of all

847
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,180
those decorative gray squares that's

848
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:21,630
just clutter and noise yes way up in the

849
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:23,819
back yeah yes it's confusing you and how

850
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,560
easy is it for you to track your eye

851
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,660
from the top of one of the columns and

852
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:31,710
try to find where it lands on the y-axis

853
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,480
that's not easy so we can see there are

854
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,060
things to be done here's a possible

855
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,380
revision there's certainly more to be

856
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,509
done but here we put one clear message

857
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,940
on top we've got rid of the decorative

858
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,220
background we put the numbers directly

859
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,100
on the columns we've got rid of the XY

860
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:49,500
access next step might be well how many

861
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,150
data points do we really need or it

862
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,070
might be maybe a whole different visual

863
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:56,160
maybe a pie chart would be a better way

864
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:59,920
to do it but think three years

865
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:02,259
examine whatever is not meaningful take

866
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,720
it off so that the audience isn't

867
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:07,060
overwhelmed or confused with having to

868
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,000
search through all the noise to get to

869
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:12,100
the actual meaning so clear concise

870
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,640
relevant content through your focus

871
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:18,220
questions and clean up your slides

872
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,319
thanks Hilary so today we talked about a

873
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,459
lot of things in 50 minutes we talked

874
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,410
about how to look and feel more

875
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,090
confident we talked about ways you can

876
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:27,250
build connection and then finally using

877
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:29,260
the focus questions and cleaning up

878
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,660
cleaning up your slides in order to

879
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:33,160
provide clarity this can feel like a lot

880
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,500
to think about especially when you're

881
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,480
nervous and you're presenting so our

882
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,670
suggestion is to think about one or two

883
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,410
things to start just one or two things

884
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:44,950
for example maybe you're going to be

885
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:46,990
loud be at that volume for slow down or

886
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,850
clean up your slides just a few things

887
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:52,060
and then once you master those things

888
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:55,120
then you can add on more later if you're

889
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:57,190
interested in more information workshops

890
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,680
or one-on-one coaching you can contact

891
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,480
us here and we have some time now for

892
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,270
Q&A so if you have any questions in the

893
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,640
moment we're happy to take it now yeah

894
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:11,280
oh do we just want to yell out the

895
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,279
questions okay it's a really loud voice

896
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:29,689
I'm gonna take this me yeah I can answer

897
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:32,930
that first question for what size of

898
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:35,860
font what we suggest for your main

899
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:40,700
message the most important takeaway a 28

900
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:43,010
bolded thawne serif font so a font that

901
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:46,040
does not have little tails on it so it's

902
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:49,490
clear a 'calibri calibri Arial are great

903
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:52,970
fonts to work with so 28 bolded to make

904
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:56,180
it pop and if it's not the main message

905
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:58,430
you can go down to 21 to 24 size font

906
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,140
when it gets down to 18 and lower it's

907
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:02,480
really hard to read and then you

908
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,940
question whether it's helping the

909
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,890
audience in any way I've also heard no

910
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,390
more than 20 words for the man who does

911
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:10,759
that right yeah the research shows that

912
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:13,220
people do not read beyond the second

913
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,020
line of text so if you're someone who

914
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,899
uses a lot of bullet point slides and

915
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,730
lots of text there's a cognitive

916
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,800
overload you'll set up with the audience

917
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:24,530
they can't listen and read your slides

918
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:28,400
so move away from really text heavy

919
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:30,670
slides try to make them more visual next

920
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,670
question

921
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:45,240
that's so remote presentations are

922
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:47,160
really hard for the remote presentations

923
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,689
I would really focus on the eye contact

924
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,399
so creating that connection I like to

925
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:52,230
put a little sticky at the top of my

926
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,880
computer to remind myself rather than

927
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:55,920
looking at my own picture reminding

928
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,770
myself to look up at the camera that's

929
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,350
helpful also pausing going slower

930
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,700
creating moments for interaction so it's

931
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:05,549
not just one way and they're more likely

932
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:08,790
to engage and not be focused on their

933
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:11,250
work and then and then in person always

934
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,540
one way to engage is to stand a lot of

935
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,130
people are in the habit of sitting down

936
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,720
but you're gonna have more engagement if

937
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:23,520
you're standing and you when you're

938
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:25,500
presenting so in a previous career I was

939
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,200
a english-as-a-second-language teacher

940
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,960
and the big thing is volume volume

941
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,669
volume so that volume for and remember

942
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,460
when we had the Grace Hopper quote and

943
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,980
we visualized the keywords if you've got

944
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,720
a loud volume and you're popping

945
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,190
important words that's the big thing it

946
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,600
doesn't matter if you have an accent but

947
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:45,240
people just need to be able to hear you

948
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:48,330
and rehearsal is always helpful as well

949
00:46:45,240 --> 00:47:05,009
I think we have time for one or two more

950
00:46:48,330 --> 00:47:07,560
questions we would suggest you might try

951
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:10,110
to play with using formulas structures

952
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,480
to help you organize how you're actually

953
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:13,770
going to deliver so there are lots of

954
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,850
different structures but one you might

955
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:19,230
use is oh you have you ever been to an

956
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,790
interview or an interview and the

957
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:23,580
interviewer says tell me about you and

958
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:25,830
your mind goes blank using a structure

959
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:27,420
could be something like past present

960
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:30,000
future so you could say well five years

961
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:33,060
ago I was with company X focused on this

962
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,110
kind of work today I am delving into

963
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:38,730
this project here with company Z looking

964
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:40,980
to two years from now I hope to be doing

965
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:43,530
this so a structure just helps you

966
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,120
organize what you're gonna say and it

967
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:47,850
gives you a little bit more brain energy

968
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,839
left over for the actual details other

969
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:51,770
structure

970
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:54,810
are things like problem-solution benefit

971
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:56,490
what the what of the issue the so what

972
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:58,460
why does my audience care about this and

973
00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:01,290
then now what what's my plan of action

974
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:03,359
so if you use structures your impromptu

975
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:05,400
speaking you suddenly become a lot more

976
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,140
eloquent and articulate then you might

977
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,180
have been previously if you just go for

978
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,460
a stream of consciousness which will

979
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:13,140
easily lose your audience we've got some

980
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,550
videos on those on youtube if you look

981
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,779
for lighthouse communications another

982
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:18,660
thing is just to focus on your

983
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,250
nonverbals the volume slowing down

984
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,990
making eye contact because even if your

985
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:25,260
contents not that good if you look

986
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:39,180
confident that's helpful okay one more

987
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:41,220
question yeah so the question was what

988
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,560
do you do if like a key player a

989
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:52,230
decision-maker seems to be skeptical or

990
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:55,500
is asking questions is that right mmm

991
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:57,450
that's so difficult yeah I would first

992
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,880
of all take a breath and realize that

993
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,140
it's not about you it's about so I would

994
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,270
instead of getting defensive and

995
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,640
shutting down I would take it breath and

996
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:07,079
tell me more David can you give me more

997
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,359
information can you give me an example

998
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:10,470
let him talk a little bit and then once

999
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,390
you breathe and calm down you'll be able

1000
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:14,939
to think more clearly on the fly so just

1001
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:16,529
breathe trust that you know what you're

1002
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:19,560
doing and you got this I could suggest

1003
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:21,180
on that too people might argue the facts

1004
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:24,869
with you but they can't argue with your

1005
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,710
experience so a comeback might be you

1006
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:27,630
know thank you very much for your

1007
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:31,290
comment in my experience when you have

1008
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:33,450
factors x and y the outcome has been a

1009
