1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,190
thank you so much for coming over to my

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,760
presentation after lunch it's always

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:12,200
difficult to be awake however I will try

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,000
my best to give you some exciting

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,299
knowledge that I have gained over last

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,060
few years about winter security to begin

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,730
with my name is Mukesh pedometer I am

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,538
part of Cisco's cloud and application

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,099
security where I help the product teams

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,380
as well as the internal teams whenever

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,350
they want to consume a third party cloud

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,000
provider so we perform that review

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,770
end-to-end review and then help that

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,210
cloud service or the vendor to remediate

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,410
the issues that we find during their

16
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,730
review

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:51,148
till now I have touched more or less 150

18
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,180
or 200 150 to 200 between 150 to 212

19
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:57,270
providers so I think I've got a good

20
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:03,390
experience from working with smaller

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:06,479
vendors to big names all right so I will

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:11,430
be sharing names in this presentation

23
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,880
and please use your wisdom if you want

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,549
to use those things in your organization

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,280
and again I'm not affiliated with any

26
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,460
one of the providers or the vendors that

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,520
I'm talking about here it's just my

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,179
experience working with them or working

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:34,820
on those tools now that we have got the

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,860
disclaimer away let's start the show so

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,539
since we are in this theater kind of a

32
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,670
setting I will be assuming things on

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,270
your behalf and by the way it feels

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,689
really exciting you know like a theater

35
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,640
awesome so in terms of the third party

36
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,508
cloud provider ecosystem

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,820
initially it was more like let's use

38
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,860
some third-party vendor for our

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,139
marketing catalog you know we want to

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,340
use them for smaller things

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,469
however the enterprises have evolved

42
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,598
their risk appetite evolved and finally

43
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:13,140
we are using them for our enterprise

44
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:16,200
businesses many of our HR vendors

45
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,000
our third party cloud services your CRM

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,220
your infrastructure mainly you know

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,160
everybody starts building their company

48
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,940
on Amazon's on the googles and

49
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,400
everything so everybody is working with

50
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:35,450
one or the other cloud vendor in order

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:38,250
to get things done now in terms of

52
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:43,519
assessment however we are still not

53
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:46,980
there if you talk about how many small

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,720
vendors or many startups or even when I

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,840
work with big organizations when I ask

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,480
them how do you assess your providers I

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,190
get one or the other answer that I'm

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,988
going to share in the next slide however

59
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,970
before that I love this code Microsoft

60
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,920
Excel is one of the tools that most of

61
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,200
the companies are using to assess their

62
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,030
cloud vendors and it was the case with

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,049
us as well with within Cisco be also

64
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,760
used Excel sheets a lot like five years

65
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,840
back we were doing most of our

66
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,359
assessments on Excel sheets

67
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,400
however we graduated to an internally

68
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,430
developed tool now so it's it's more

69
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,010
automated the question and answer if if

70
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,600
you have worked on any of the assessment

71
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,390
with Cisco then you'll know that there's

72
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,870
a portal where you can log in and get

73
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:37,018
those things done in terms of assessment

74
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,920
tools usually as I shared in my previous

75
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:44,160
slide excel sheet is the number one and

76
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,488
then you've got Word document you've got

77
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,519
internally developed tools you hire

78
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,350
third party consultants there are

79
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,239
consultants they they try to work on

80
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,730
these things as well and finally if you

81
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,650
are very confident about the vendor you

82
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,899
just need them over a coffee cup of

83
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:05,519
coffee and then sort this sort things

84
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:09,390
out now I've been talking about Excel

85
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,870
sheets but what happens in in those

86
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,429
excel sheets so usually if you have

87
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,820
follow cloud security lines they have

88
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,220
come up with a questionnaire ciq kind of

89
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,280
a thing where you can have questions

90
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,139
ranging on different topics and those

91
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,039
questions are being sent to the provider

92
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:31,419
they answer those questions as an

93
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:34,240
assessment team you review those

94
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:35,889
responses you meet with them check

95
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,110
whether those responses are meeting your

96
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,259
criteria or not and then finally if

97
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,789
there is any mismatch for example you

98
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,500
require a certain thing where as they

99
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:47,199
are not able to provide you give them

100
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,300
that kind of finding finally they

101
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,699
remediate if you are able to influence

102
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:55,090
and then after a mediation you are proof

103
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:59,289
and this cycle goes on and on for all

104
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:02,020
the providers now in in terms of the

105
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:04,599
categories it ranges from just

106
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,120
application security so sometimes I've

107
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:09,909
seen people asking questions about

108
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,979
application security only for example do

109
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,629
you perform dynamic testing or not do

110
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,460
you perform static testing or not do you

111
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:16,840
perform threat modeling for this

112
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,219
application that we are using or not or

113
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,869
do you perform any rapid patching for

114
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:24,370
your application so those those are the

115
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,669
application security related things

116
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:30,610
however if you look at the CI Q or if

117
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:33,128
you look at any bigger questionnaire it

118
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,900
will cover several other categories so

119
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:38,830
you'll have your identities and access

120
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:41,979
management do you perform any single

121
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,560
sign-on sam'l 2.0 do you support a sam'l

122
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:47,979
to do you support OAuth or not data

123
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,259
security how do you encrypt the data do

124
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:53,229
you store backups how long those backups

125
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:55,870
are stored if we want to get off from

126
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:58,360
you is there a way where you can

127
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,250
securely delete the data so those kind

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,900
of questions will go into data security

129
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,180
and so on once I can talk about these

130
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,909
questions all day long and it will not

131
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:10,419
end but just to give you a glimpse like

132
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:13,330
what kind of questions are there now if

133
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:15,180
you were with me till now so we started

134
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,339
with Excel sheets we started about the

135
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,930
process we then discussed some of the

136
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:27,339
questions that that that are done during

137
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:31,900
this process everything is sequential

138
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:33,550
and then everything is point in time so

139
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,469
the interview process when I talk to the

140
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,630
provider or when they give me their pen

141
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:38,770
test report it's a point in time

142
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,310
situation where you

143
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,198
giving evidences for that movement and

144
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,360
then sometimes you don't go back to that

145
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:50,050
provider yes they are approved they'll

146
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:53,020
always be secured however in this day

147
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,479
and age it's important to go back to

148
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,310
them and ask questions again or maybe

149
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:00,900
review and find out the way to do

150
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:03,610
continuous review for example like I

151
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,630
reviewed one provider at the time of

152
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:10,930
assessment they were supporting SSL

153
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:13,659
version 3 and that becomes a finding it

154
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,759
was given to them they said ok we'll fix

155
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:18,219
it in six months they fixed it so now

156
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,409
after six months they are like we have

157
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,539
we don't support SSL version 3 did an

158
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:25,750
SSL I did an SSL scan they are not

159
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:27,818
however after one year when I was trying

160
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,759
to reassess them they are still there

161
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:32,229
they're still on SSL version 3 and I'm

162
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,479
like you know you guys fix it and then

163
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,550
yeah we had to roll back some of our

164
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,430
customers were using older browsers and

165
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,530
that was like wow now I did not nor my

166
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,500
company did not know about that risk for

167
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,179
6 or 8 months when they were just using

168
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,919
it when they were still supporting SSL

169
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,300
version 3 so that's the point in time

170
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,758
problem

171
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,270
also if you again following the process

172
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,919
its its time-consuming use and excel

173
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,330
sheet then you receive the response then

174
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,729
you meet with them then you tell those

175
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,580
things so and so forth so this is

176
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,770
time-consuming and one thing that we

177
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,080
don't have in this day and age is time

178
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,150
if you ask anyone you know this is a

179
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,490
time consuming process it takes three

180
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,830
weeks they will ask immediately can we

181
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,169
automate this so so that that's the

182
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,900
problem with this process and then also

183
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:22,780
we are relying on their answers we are

184
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,030
not able to verify it independently it's

185
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,989
inconsistent some people are doing Excel

186
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,059
sheets some people are doing five

187
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,699
questions ten question and so on so

188
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:33,399
these are the challenges all right so

189
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:35,560
now when we were looking at these

190
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,440
challenges we wanted to identify how we

191
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:42,489
can solve this and during my internship

192
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,829
I got exposed to pen testing I had I

193
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,380
loved it and I loved the recon phase a

194
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:50,229
lot because you gather information like

195
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,040
whatever resources you can put your hand

196
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,440
on and then

197
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,819
where we thought that why can't we use

198
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,740
the tried and tested method that was

199
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,050
being used in penetration testing red

200
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,680
teaming in this winter security

201
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,420
assessment so we started brainstorming

202
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:11,229
the idea of collecting information from

203
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:14,020
Internet and this became the foundation

204
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,160
of the solution so now again this

205
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,880
solution is still work in progress

206
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,329
however the proposal is you collect

207
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,030
information from several sources that

208
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,220
are already scanning or giving

209
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:30,310
information about these providers so I

210
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:34,000
briefly introduced you all to a source

211
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:36,670
which was SSL scanning now that there

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,680
are several websites tools available on

213
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,170
internet where you can just put the URL

214
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,449
and it will tell you the SSL score for

215
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,280
example which SSL version this support

216
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,620
what kind of cipher suites they support

217
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,189
do they support any modern cipher suite

218
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,440
or not HSTs everything so that is the

219
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,290
kind of resource that I am talking about

220
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,060
now this is only related to TLS so

221
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,630
instead of asking questions to the

222
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,359
provider

223
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,070
what kind of SSL TLS version SSL or TLS

224
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,720
version do you support we'll just do a

225
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,940
scan and we'll just go back with the

226
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,430
report if we have anything if not then

227
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,310
we'll just continuously scan maybe every

228
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:16,239
day we are just scanning all the URLs

229
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:22,060
then there are other sources for example

230
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:24,430
something like Sudan or HD bridge mobile

231
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,839
where you can scan the mobile app of the

232
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,739
vendor or you can perform vulnerability

233
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,930
whatever vulnerability information is

234
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,870
out there so that you are getting that

235
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:38,859
flow continuous flow now all these

236
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:41,080
sources you have to identify which are

237
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,540
the high impact ones versus the low

238
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,850
impact ones for example SSL becomes a

239
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,680
high impact for us where we are

240
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,260
continuously monitoring and then if

241
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,770
there is any mismatch with the kind of

242
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,750
data that we are putting so again the

243
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,610
requirements change based on the data

244
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,400
classification if you are putting the

245
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,330
sensitive information then TLS 1.2 is

246
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,089
absolute must

247
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:06,279
versus if it is a marketing catalog then

248
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:09,370
we have some affinity where the epithet

249
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,839
is like yeah we can survive with TLS 1.1

250
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:13,360
as well because it's just a marketing

251
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,749
catalog so those kind of things based on

252
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:22,170
impact and accuracy the overall score

253
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:25,569
must be calculated now this is the basic

254
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:29,349
table that I'm sharing what we can do

255
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:32,680
with this kind of data but if you notice

256
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:36,059
there there are two columns which are

257
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,199
not very much into the zone of

258
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:40,329
collecting information for example sock

259
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:43,269
2 is the one that I am referring now

260
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:45,279
song 2 is something soft to type 2 is

261
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:47,949
something that you cannot get directly

262
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,079
from Internet you have to sign an NDA

263
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:53,019
with the provider and then they will

264
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,410
send you that talk to so the plan is not

265
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:58,769
only relying on the the information that

266
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,209
we are getting from internet but also

267
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:02,259
massage it with some some of the

268
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:05,109
information that you might receive

269
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:06,670
through soft reports of these vendors so

270
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,860
that that that way you can get an

271
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,050
overall health of the provider at any

272
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,970
given point of thing yes they're soft to

273
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,429
type who is still valid and the other

274
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:18,790
things that we found out in on internet

275
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:21,279
are green so this is good versus yeah

276
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,290
the things are yellow or in red so let's

277
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,100
go back to the provider and ask

278
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,959
questions so let me share more resources

279
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,410
so SSL scan was one of the resource

280
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,910
now let's map these resources to the

281
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,759
categories that we discussed earlier

282
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:39,339
like the categories of questions how can

283
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:42,249
we identify more resources that will

284
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:45,699
help us bridge the questions that we are

285
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:48,040
asking in different categories so that's

286
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:49,870
where I started searching and whenever I

287
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,639
come across any tool I just bookmark

288
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,860
started bookmarking those things and

289
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:57,189
finally was able to come up with a good

290
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:01,860
list of 20-25 providers that can give me

291
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:04,860
information on a continuous basis so

292
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,079
I've documented those things as well in

293
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:10,240
in the github page the awesome cloud

294
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,410
ocean where you can find out more about

295
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,870
this but quick overview of this you can

296
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,550
find SSL score if

297
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,560
the provider is giving you mobile app

298
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:24,430
because like everyone is mobile so you

299
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,589
can have mobile scans so that their new

300
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:30,130
app if it is vulnerable to anything or

301
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:33,790
not you will get it easily then there is

302
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:36,130
IP reputation whether that provider is

303
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,199
hosting or they have an IP address which

304
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,960
was flagged for malware or anything that

305
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,550
you can find breach information is an

306
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,740
important thing you know it's always

307
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,779
important to keep a tab onto those

308
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,550
Google queries where you can just search

309
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:50,589
for breach information or those Twitter

310
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,719
accounts that are reporting this

311
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:55,839
information because your provider might

312
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,720
not be sharing that thing with you the

313
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,920
moment they got breached however through

314
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,520
all the resources you can get to that

315
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,930
and then the next thing will be oh we

316
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:09,550
heard in the news that you got breached

317
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:11,529
did our data was part of that that data

318
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,959
breach so that kind of a thing will

319
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:17,290
happen once you start building this

320
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:20,529
monitoring capability now to give you

321
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,719
examples of what these tools look like

322
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,250
so let me take the example of mobile

323
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,100
because I'm assuming SSL is a very

324
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:31,270
minimum bar so most of you would have

325
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:34,600
done SSL scan in the past or maybe doing

326
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:37,240
it today this that's why I'm considering

327
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,240
the category of mobile app so the HD

328
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,400
bridge is the open or rather else a free

329
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,400
premium solution which is available

330
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:49,150
currently they support only Android so

331
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:51,550
what I used to do earlier whenever we

332
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:54,339
are consuming any cloud service I was

333
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,170
just putting their app if we are going

334
00:14:54,339 --> 00:15:00,190
to use it then we'll just put their app

335
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:04,990
try to identify the potential flaws now

336
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:08,110
again this data is very basic the reason

337
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:11,620
is a it's an unauthenticated scan so if

338
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,240
you are asking the provider about a pen

339
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,310
test report herbal remedy scan report

340
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,830
for their mobile app it will be much

341
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:20,050
better then what this will provide

342
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:23,880
because that will be where the pen

343
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:26,109
testers will try to identify other flaws

344
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,660
bypass authentication and other things

345
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,699
versus vulnerability scan they might use

346
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,769
authenticated scan

347
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:35,368
so that's a better one however this is

348
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:37,499
giving some information oh they have a

349
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:41,089
hard coded ticket in their Android app

350
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:44,939
very easy the code is not office gated

351
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:47,839
problem they supported the they started

352
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:50,040
supporting a library which is obsolete

353
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,059
absolute spot on so you can go back to

354
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,639
the provider and do it now and that's

355
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:59,910
how you get those things as you can see

356
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,850
in the screen this little utility can

357
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:06,449
find out issues with the mobile app now

358
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:09,269
I was talking only for the category I

359
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:12,858
was sharing about most of the tools were

360
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:15,569
in free whereas there are premium

361
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:17,399
vendors as well and as a premium those

362
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:19,290
are the vendors who are providing this

363
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,290
kind of service searching the internet

364
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,269
are searching the mobile apps and then

365
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,480
providing and then giving a security

366
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:29,489
information so those vendors are the

367
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,029
vendors that you can also tap on to so

368
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:36,839
we what we are doing internally is to

369
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:41,189
have a mix of both so wherever we can

370
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:44,699
find impactful data wherever the trust

371
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:47,789
is high on the data we are going we are

372
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:49,679
going with that it's difficult sometimes

373
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:52,499
to convince the management that you know

374
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,600
we are going to use a solution that will

375
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:57,299
cost money and that will help us reduce

376
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,509
five questions however in the longer run

377
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:02,160
it helps because if you are on the other

378
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:04,380
side then you are just filling out

379
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,678
questionnaire day in day out like 150

380
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,419
questions 200 questions and then people

381
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,699
are just hiring big teams just to answer

382
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,539
however if you go back to them ask only

383
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,699
two questions

384
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:16,919
ten questions then the team will be very

385
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:21,089
happy so in a longer run this will be

386
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:24,419
very helpful now let's come back to this

387
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:27,208
so we started having some free tools and

388
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:28,769
then we started looking to buy as in

389
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,840
getting licenses for some tools as well

390
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:32,960
so I'll give you an example of now

391
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,428
secure Intel now just to have a parity

392
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,919
the previous example with the free

393
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:40,440
category was HT bridge similar space

394
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,460
company named as now secure they also

395
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,890
play

396
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:47,010
they have a tool called his Intel that

397
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,440
can go into Play Store and iTunes and

398
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:52,500
then identify this course so that's good

399
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,080
now you can have a premium tool that can

400
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,000
identify so if you have 100 apps that

401
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,649
you are consuming you can just put those

402
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,480
things here and start monitoring those

403
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:02,969
things whatever alerts you are getting

404
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,289
send it back to the vendor and then they

405
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:11,520
will be able to work on those now not

406
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:15,899
only this helps in after the fact for

407
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:19,289
example till now I've been sharing the

408
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:23,908
advantages in the form of yeah we are

409
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:25,529
using XYZ app and they are we assess

410
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:28,200
them improve them and now we are

411
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:31,309
monitoring so so that's the value no not

412
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,980
only that is the value it also provides

413
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:36,899
value before the assessment so even

414
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,510
before the assessment or before any

415
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:42,389
acquisition you can start monitoring

416
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:46,289
that particular company and then get to

417
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:49,289
know how's their health it helps to

418
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:51,840
Foltz one if you are just going to

419
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:54,270
assess them for lower data

420
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,490
classification you might want to just

421
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,649
use that available information and auto

422
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:02,250
approve them without going through this

423
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:04,289
questionnaire phase or if you're going

424
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,169
to make ask questions it will be less

425
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:09,809
questions also the acquisitions and

426
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:11,640
partnerships so if you are going to make

427
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:14,340
an acquisition just to get the health

428
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,990
instead of asking questions around you

429
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,418
you can get a continuous staff for the

430
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:22,140
last six months how did they respond and

431
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:25,380
then make a decision and finally it is

432
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,690
what consistent approach now in the

433
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:33,080
question and answer approach or exit

434
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:35,909
approach it's more perception so I

435
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,210
whatever the engineer things or whatever

436
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:42,980
the other company thinks if the engineer

437
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:46,020
thinks that yes this I am fine with TLS

438
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:48,000
1.1 because yeah I have not seen any

439
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,070
attacks although the policy says one or

440
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,350
two but I am fine with that so now you

441
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,540
don't have control as a company you are

442
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,510
allowing another vendor to have

443
00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:01,260
lower-grade of TLS or data and

444
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:03,270
encryption yeah we just do disk level

445
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,300
encryption we do not encrypt data on

446
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:10,200
database level or on app level so those

447
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:12,120
kind of things are easy when when those

448
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,860
kinds of things will change from person

449
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,139
to person however if we have this

450
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,330
approach then at least a section of

451
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,270
questions will be very consistent so

452
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,370
that's the advantage but with all said

453
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:26,220
again recon has its own disadvantages

454
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:28,800
like false positives limited information

455
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,930
and other things so we cannot ignore

456
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,000
that and it requires lot of engineering

457
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,890
for example I've been working on this

458
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,770
for last two and half years and we are

459
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:41,280
still like we got two commercial tools

460
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:44,629
and some free tools and trying to build

461
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,590
more redundancy trying to build more

462
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:48,420
calculate trying to come up with more

463
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:53,820
calculation to come up with that number

464
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:56,850
so that's still going on finally I will

465
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:02,330
conclude my presentation with three

466
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:04,889
things everyone every company is using

467
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,250
third party clouds in some way or the

468
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,740
other

469
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:11,820
some are assessing them some are not

470
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,980
assessing them so that's a fact however

471
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,090
it is very important as security

472
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:21,060
professionals to identify the security

473
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:24,149
company that you are using whether it's

474
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:26,190
secure or not so if you if your company

475
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,340
is not doing it at least try to do it in

476
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:32,160
some form or shape the second thing that

477
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,949
I will leave you with is the solution so

478
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,840
one of the things one of the continuous

479
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,640
feedback that I get from all the cloud

480
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,050
providers that I have assist you are

481
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,130
asking too many questions so that's the

482
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,180
that's the direction that we have to go

483
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,310
where we are not asking too many

484
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,930
questions so that the relationship is

485
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:55,230
still built where they are ready to talk

486
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:58,170
to us finally in the future I expect we

487
00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:00,630
can have a mutual a portal where

488
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,870
everybody is sharing their security

489
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,150
things so that it's a you know we don't

490
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:07,000
have

491
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,710
talk to the vendor directly and we can

492
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,960
get whatever information we want maybe

493
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,300
it's an API so that we can just consume

494
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,900
whenever we want and continuously tap

495
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:20,460
onto our vendors so that's pretty much

496
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:23,260
