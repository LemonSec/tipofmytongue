00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,210
obsession with securing software runs

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,279
deep from starting her company to

other women in her field as a

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,870
professional computer geek of 20-plus

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,538
years she is a person who is truly

23
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:04,188
fascinated by the science of computer

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:06,420
science give it up for Tanya thank you

25
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:08,279
thank you for coming to my talk there's

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,930
a whole bunch of really good talks for

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,369
this entire conference and some of them

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,500
are at the same time as mine so I

29
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,330
appreciate you choosing mine this is

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,090
going to be the Lightning version of

31
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,100
this talk because usually it's a full

32
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,170
hour where I try to melt your brains out

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,600
of your ears so you're only gonna get 25

34
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,460
minutes of that let's start so this is

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,979
called purple is the new black and we're

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,460
going to talk about purple teams and by

37
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,908
that I mean hi we're gonna talk about

38
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:38,908
modernizing application security because

39
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:40,890
essentially we can't we can't have

40
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,140
modern apps and then not change the way

41
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,759
we do security because then we're only

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,009
gonna be catching some of the problems

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,159
and protecting them partially so I'm

44
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,619
gonna talk about all new things not old

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,350
stuff I'm skipping my own purpose all

46
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,600
right let's do this so we always do the

47
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,919
mandatory about me slide because we want

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,929
you to think that we're qualified to

49
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,790
give our own talks it's not like the

50
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,530
bragging thing it's just like I need you

51
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,030
to know I'm a person I do lots of stuff

52
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,479
I hope you're gonna stay the whole time

53
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,910
I'm obsessed with a wasp I am a big part

54
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,640
of lowsec

55
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:17,000
and I train and do stuff so that's me hi

56
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,850
okay onto the talk so I'm just going to

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,850
talk about modern application security

58
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:26,269
and normally I would do definitions but

59
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:28,130
you already know that I'm not going to

60
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,510
explain what app SEC is and do all of

61
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,799
that warm up we're just gonna go right

62
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,950
into it all right

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,690
okay so again I love Oh ASP and I have

64
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,320
stickers of this after in case you want

65
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:41,840
it okay what the purple team does is

66
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,670
application security so you have red

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,980
team's that attack networks and attack

68
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,079
software and attack systems you have

69
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,060
blue team's that defend systems those

70
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,130
are the people that fix your firewalls

71
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,260
that patch things and implement security

72
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,090
tools but in the middle between the

73
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,579
developers and the security team is the

74
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,530
app SEC team that's where I live that's

75
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,080
my favorite topic and that's what we're

76
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,700
going to talk about today okay so the

77
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,240
first thing I want to talk about that's

78
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,609
a new thing at zero trust way back in

79
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,800
the day when I started a long time ago

80
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,200
in tech first of all there was no

81
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,180
security because I'm older than I look

82
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,440
but then eventually we're like you know

83
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,380
what we should do we should put a big

84
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,200
barrier and gate around everything we'll

85
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,970
build a wall and then now keep everyone

86
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,589
out and everyone inside I'm sure we

87
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,350
trust them we have learned that that

88
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:35,480
doesn't actually work that well because

89
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:38,299
what hackers like to call opportunity we

90
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,488
as defender it's called pivoting and so

91
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,380
we don't want them coming in and if they

92
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,940
do we want it to be awful we want them

93
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,160
to not be able to get anywhere so that's

94
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,109
where zero trust came from a lot of

95
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,750
people just talk about zero trust as it

96
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,310
relates specifically to networks but I

97
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,890
believe we can do this with apps with

98
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:58,130
API is anything that talks to anything

99
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,500
ask first ask first make sure that you

100
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,810
trust them don't just blindly trust this

101
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,870
is a thing we used to do I know cuz I

102
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,610
did it but now we're not doing that

103
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,760
anymore we're having better results and

104
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:14,450
hand in hand with zero trust is assumed

105
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:16,010
breach so let's practice as though we

106
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,289
have been breached let's assume that

107
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,000
someone's been inside so let's say you

108
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,310
have a bug bounty where you work or a

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,110
responsible disclosure program if

110
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:27,140
report something to you that's

111
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,900
exploitable act like maybe it was go

112
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,510
investigate check it out right do all

113
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,409
the things and act as though you might

114
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,450
have been breached

115
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,360
you will unfortunately be right

116
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,640
sometimes I know I know that sounds bad

117
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,160
but trust me you will win if you act

118
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,979
this way okay so other new things

119
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,270
serverless is new logic apps are new

120
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,890
first I'm going to explain what they are

121
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,900
then I'm gonna make fun of them just

122
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,460
kidding not really and then I'm gonna

123
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,830
explain like what security things we

124
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,799
need to work about so a logic app is a

125
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,740
trigger so it just calls a serverless

126
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,560
app so let's say if someone tries to

127
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,810
login 10 or more times in one second

128
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,669
that will trigger a logic app lot of

129
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,870
cloud providers have this they have

130
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:11,479
different names for it but essentially

131
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,760
it's just a trigger a serverless app is

132
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,570
a script a little tiny piece of software

133
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,099
that usually just does one thing and it

134
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,080
did not live on a server that's why it's

135
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,090
called service so basically when it gets

136
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,820
triggered by illogic tap are called

137
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,280
directly from an application it explodes

138
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,349
a container runs itself and then

139
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,260
self-destructs so you don't have to pay

140
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:35,030
for server time the whole time guess

141
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,099
what we still have to secure them I

142
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:40,580
don't think everyone knows yet though

143
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,800
ask any pun tester people seem to be

144
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,330
thinking like at 1990 again security

145
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,850
doesn't count no that's not true

146
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,320
it still counts so we still need to do

147
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,570
all the same app SEC stuff that we

148
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,969
normally do so we need to sanitize our

149
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,830
inputs right I know that sounds really

150
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,360
obvious like we need to authenticate and

151
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,430
authorize pete like we can't just let

152
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,370
everyone in I know this sounds like

153
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,970
really obvious apparently it's not but

154
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,060
there's more

155
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:07,580
ok so with so these are yes so we want

156
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,500
to monitor and log our functions but

157
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,210
then we want it actually I'm getting

158
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,680
ahead of myself we wanted to do secure

159
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,049
coding and we want to make sure we

160
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,820
verify or that we secure our data in

161
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,830
transit and then if you put in a

162
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,390
database obviously at rest but there's

163
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,300
new stuff so this is the new stuff

164
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:25,820
modern improvements so we want to do an

165
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,669
API gateway I know we talked about how

166
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,949
gates are bad like four seconds ago

167
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:32,568
but what I mean by this is like no one

168
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:34,039
is allowed talking to the api's unless

169
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:36,139
they come in through the gateway and

170
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,419
then you still have secured your api's

171
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,969
within their but it's one more layer of

172
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,969
defense and depths and then on top of

173
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:46,189
that we want to not only monitor and

174
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:48,919
logger functions want the information to

175
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:51,620
go to the sim because we want to pick up

176
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,419
on when there are anomalies and problems

177
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,289
and if no one's actually looking at

178
00:06:53,419 --> 00:07:00,049
those logs we won't find them and I have

179
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,909
so many stories about logging things and

180
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:06,349
then finding out years later oh that

181
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:08,180
looks really bad in 2011 anyway next um

182
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:10,969
we want to manage our secrets in a

183
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,740
secret store so way back in the day when

184
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:15,259
we used to save our stuff directly into

185
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,599
our code that became bad then we put in

186
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:20,150
the database that became bad now we use

187
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,259
secret stores and your api's can - and

188
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,378
lastly

189
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:26,569
oh no there's two more we want our api's

190
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:28,879
or our service apps to generally just do

191
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:31,460
one thing we don't want one cyrillus app

192
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,849
that does 500 things because that's an

193
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,960
app just write an app right like if you

194
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:37,699
have each serverless

195
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,080
app just do one tiny thing if one of

196
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,039
them is down there one of them's broken

197
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,258
the rest of your app and your

198
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,378
functionality still works so menu

199
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,909
minimal granularity and then lastly we

200
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:48,589
want to isolate our function perimeters

201
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:50,330
and by this I mean don't just

202
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:52,789
automatically trust so if you have an

203
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,740
app you log into it you authenticate to

204
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:56,479
it it calls a service app you

205
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,330
authenticates that serverless app then

206
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,188
that service app calls another one you

207
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,719
still need to attend a cape there for

208
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:06,710
some reason everyone's like oh it's fine

209
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:09,219
now it's not okay next awesome third

210
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,680
party component and library management

211
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:14,629
software supply chain security there are

212
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,370
a lot of tools right now on the market

213
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:19,039
that do this and then there's a free one

214
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:22,729
from wasp called a wasp dependancy check

215
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,909
a lot of people call this open source

216
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:27,589
security as in managing all of your

217
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:29,330
third-party components but it doesn't

218
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:31,430
actually matter if it's open source or

219
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,069
its proprietary source if there are

220
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,159
vulnerabilities in it and you put it in

221
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,690
your app and then you release your app

222
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,120
you took oath vulnerabilities put it

223
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,919
right in and then release them so it

224
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,909
doesn't matter if you

225
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,649
using something that's proprietary

226
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,529
like.net if you're using something

227
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,570
totally open-source like Ruby both them

228
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:51,670
are awesome but I want you to use secure

229
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,790
versions so we usually do something

230
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,500
called software composition analysis or

231
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,779
SCA

232
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,490
so I'm gonna say something vendors don't

233
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:02,649
like I think you should use two tools

234
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,329
not one if you can afford it because

235
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:06,339
each tool looks at things in a

236
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:07,750
completely different way and they have

237
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:10,149
different teams looking at different

238
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,829
things and whenever I used to be a pen

239
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,750
tester and I would pen test somewhere

240
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:16,180
they'd say okay we'll call you next year

241
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:18,010
and I would tell them stupidly this is

242
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,239
why I don't make enough money I'd be

243
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,860
like you shouldn't hire me you should

244
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,570
hire another pen tester who will look at

245
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,560
it with a different set of eyes and they

246
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,690
might find something that I've missed

247
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,859
like I like to think I'm perfect but

248
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:32,410
only me and my mom actually believe that

249
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:35,529
okay and so you also in my opinion want

250
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,180
to scan your repository often but then

251
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,189
you also want to scan in your build

252
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,349
pipeline I know that this might sound

253
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:43,660
weird but sometimes you upgrade from a

254
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,850
much older version to a newer version so

255
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,170
you've actually gone up a version but

256
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,360
that version is the one with the

257
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,370
vulnerabilities so that's why you want

258
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,880
to check in your pipeline and then you

259
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,079
also want to check in your repository

260
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,610
specifically because you have lots of

261
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:59,680
legacy apps that you probably don't

262
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,640
release very often but there's still

263
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,979
researchers and malicious actors who are

264
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,510
still looking at them and the longer

265
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,070
it's been out there and the longer you

266
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,930
haven't checked it for the more likely

267
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,730
that there's actually vulnerabilities

268
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,920
that have been documented that are known

269
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,350
that you could be catching by scanning

270
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,519
your apposite or irregularly I already

271
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,940
said that all right

272
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:25,920
next I'm very I'm trying really hard to

273
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:29,980
keep on time okay so online storage

274
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,560
crown jewels when I first started going

275
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,120
to security conferences open s3 buckets

276
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,189
were like this really big joke and

277
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,720
everyone's like hahahaha because

278
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,350
apparently we laugh at our victims

279
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,449
that's what we do but I am really happy

280
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,220
that all of the cloud providers have

281
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:48,760
learned from that and now all of them

282
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:51,519
are by default making the settings quite

283
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,069
secure but we can do more so on top of

284
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,630
making like them not being open by

285
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:58,870
default there's a lot more now

286
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,670
so one you can make templates with

287
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,620
whoever your cloud provider is all the

288
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:06,459
major public clouds do this so that

289
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,830
every new container their storage

290
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,250
container that's created underneath your

291
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:14,320
organization or your subscription has a

292
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,480
template that it must follow and you can

293
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,160
just walk that down really

294
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,800
you can harden the crap out of that and

295
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,650
then on top of that I suggest that

296
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,930
everyone start classifying their data

297
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:28,290
who thinks data classifications really

298
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,819
fun and exciting just kidding

299
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:32,260
who here does instant response and when

300
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,420
you find out that all the data that's

301
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:38,830
been leaked as public feels really

302
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:41,020
relieved yeah I totally have strands of

303
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,270
hair that are all gray and they're

304
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,100
because people did it label or classify

305
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,740
their data not kidding

306
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,390
so please classify your data it really

307
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,040
really really helps your ensnare

308
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,710
responders and it helps everyone know

309
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,890
what to do with it next we should

310
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:59,440
monitor these containers what I know I'm

311
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,420
wild and we should Alert on them Mosul

312
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,280
cloud providers will let you like they

313
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,380
have all sorts of automatic monitoring

314
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,600
and all of that you can do but you could

315
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,939
do some yourself like we talked about

316
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,790
earlier with triggers and server lists

317
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:16,180
you can create your own triggers and

318
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,699
have serverless do things for you that's

319
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:22,420
what code is it's computers doing your

320
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,850
bidding that's why I like it so I

321
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,890
strongly strongly suggest monitoring all

322
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,680
your containers and setting up alerts if

323
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,970
you have a public cloud provider give it

324
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,739
your phone number if you're on the

325
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,900
security team it might sound silly but I

326
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:38,320
had a juror call me once and I was so

327
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,630
glad it had my phone number just once in

328
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,970
two years but gosh it mattered anyway

329
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:48,670
next you should also audit this and make

330
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,100
sure that you're only accessing your

331
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,780
containers sorry I shouldn't say

332
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,880
containers you should only access your

333
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,970
online storage using a service account

334
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,320
so I used to back in the day because I

335
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,070
started programming at the beginning of

336
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,600
time I would use Tonya's account Tonya's

337
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,740
account would access the database and

338
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,150
Tonya's I can't would do this and

339
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,370
Tonya's account would do that and

340
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,860
would go find a better job and then all

341
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,600
the things are broken so instead we want

342
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,210
to have service accounts doing things so

343
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,640
it's not done yet 4:00 a.m. that appears

344
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,529
to think that she needs to log into blah

345
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,880
blah blah if you see a service account

346
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,689
doing that you're like okay I know

347
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,370
what's going on

348
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,110
but if you see Tonya doing that there's

349
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,350
probably a problem and if an incident

350
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:32,080
hasn't already been called and started

351
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,910
you probably should start running mmm

352
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,150
okay next container it's an

353
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:39,160
orchestration so I'm going to explain

354
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,439
first I know that a lot of you probably

355
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,770
know this and sometimes i over-explained

356
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,450
I do that because when I first went to a

357
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,890
security conference I couldn't

358
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:52,240
understand anything the whole two days

359
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:53,680
and I just walked around like this and I

360
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,930
really want to make sure everyone

361
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,390
understands the whole talk so I don't

362
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,650
mean to patronize anyone I know most of

363
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,819
you know this but for the few that don't

364
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:05,949
so we used to run servers on physical

365
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,020
machines and then eventually we started

366
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,060
creating virtual machines or VM so we

367
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,819
would take an operating system smush it

368
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,400
run it in a hypervisor on a server so we

369
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,810
could run a few on the same machine but

370
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,970
then a very smart person created

371
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,790
containers containers are even smaller

372
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:25,810
so a virtual machine might need two gigs

373
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,699
of space and two gigs of memory to run

374
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,459
so you could put maybe two or three or

375
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,160
four on a server a container you can run

376
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:35,529
with sometimes two Meg's of memory and

377
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,020
four Meg's of space so you can put a

378
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,000
whole bunch of containers and run them

379
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,189
all at the same time makes things faster

380
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,140
smaller and you only have the parts of

381
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,990
the operating system you truly need and

382
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,300
then orchestration is the managing of

383
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:51,790
all the containers deleting loading them

384
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,969
up taking them down all the things that

385
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:58,510
you do with containers is orchestration

386
00:14:53,970 --> 00:15:01,440
okay now your experts please still do

387
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,490
regular Network security on these things

388
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,640
please still make sure your

389
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,560
configurations make sense it sounds

390
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,830
really silly but sometimes we get new

391
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,599
tech and we are so excited i OT and then

392
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,640
we just forget all about the rules of

393
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,520
security

394
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,680
and it's bad people don't forget

395
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,449
unfortunately so we have to be diligent

396
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,900
right from the very beginning and that

397
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:28,440
includes with fun fun fun containers

398
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,970
plus basically it's kind of the same as

399
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,740
previous like with virtual machines

400
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,690
except for there's new configurations

401
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,280
there's new security tools there's new

402
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,290
types of scanning there's new types of

403
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,680
vulnerabilities but you still basically

404
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:44,130
need to look out for vulnerabilities and

405
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,420
you still need to a lot of people say

406
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,160
you shouldn't patch you would just

407
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,290
create a new updated version and then

408
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,390
release that and delete the old one but

409
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,699
the point is is that you absolutely

410
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,080
absolutely need to make sure that they

411
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,270
are secure you can't just put a

412
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,460
container out there for a year and then

413
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,500
just let it go I mean you could but it's

414
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,600
going to be very bad I'm also

415
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,100
specifically with containers you really

416
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,410
need to watch out for who has the rights

417
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,680
to edit them create them or delete them

418
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,300
this is a brand new area of interest for

419
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,099
people who don't have your best

420
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,469
interests at heart so please watch that

421
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,760
and then lastly just do all the same

422
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,250
things you would normally do like you

423
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,750
still need to protect them in all the

424
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,080
same way that you would protect anything

425
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,750
on your network okay next sorry I'm

426
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,740
going fast but like I said we have only

427
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,040
a few minutes left

428
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:36,090
okay so api's and micro services am I

429
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,290
going to explain what this is yes I'm so

430
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,560
an API stands for application

431
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:43,680
programming interface but it's basically

432
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,359
an app with no front end and it can do

433
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,550
whatever you want except for have a

434
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,830
front end so there's no GUI but there's

435
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:53,310
all those other things and then a micro

436
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:56,580
service is an API that just as one

437
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:59,160
single thing the idea of a micro service

438
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:02,070
is that if you have an app that then we

439
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,500
call one giant API if instead you have

440
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:06,420
20 micro services if one of them's down

441
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,810
the rest of your app still works and

442
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:15,089
that's pretty great so guess what we

443
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,240
still have to do basic app sec we still

444
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:21,659
need to make sure our inputs are good we

445
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,430
still want to use everything with TLS we

446
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,470
still want to do all the stuff that you

447
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,169
already obviously have memorized and

448
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,259
always do perfectly

449
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:35,149
you need to do that but more there's

450
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:37,399
always more a new thing well it's not

451
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,899
really that new but it seems it must be

452
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:41,959
new because not everyone is using it yet

453
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:44,178
service match service matches a layer of

454
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,220
infrastructure and all of your api's can

455
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:48,169
go through it and then it protects it

456
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,830
end to end you don't have to change any

457
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:53,720
code yes that sounds great all the cloud

458
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,299
providers offer it there's also

459
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,559
third-party ones they're interoperable

460
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:04,609
and yeah I I like the idea of having an

461
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,830
extra layer of security standardization

462
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:08,389
or templating for your org I have worked

463
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,340
out a lot of places or a whole bunch of

464
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:12,408
different teams we're all making api's

465
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,449
and they're all excited and everyone was

466
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:17,330
a snowflake snowflakes are bad

467
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,669
insecurities snowflakes make it hard for

468
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,189
me to do my job I mean if you're a

469
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:24,249
contractor pen tester you're like yeah

470
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:27,259
I'm awesome look at all these snowflakes

471
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:29,059
but as someone who is quite often or

472
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:31,999
until recently used to always be the

473
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:36,499
employee where it's like I own that API

474
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:38,299
I sit next to those people you want to

475
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:41,210
have standardization and templating

476
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:44,869
whenever you can I'm also a big fan of

477
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:47,869
linting linting is like the grammar

478
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:49,850
police but for your code I remember the

479
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:51,439
first time I developer showed me a new

480
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,820
language and they're telling me you

481
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,009
don't even have to declare what type of

482
00:18:52,820 --> 00:19:00,139
variable it is it'll just figure it out

483
00:18:55,009 --> 00:19:02,029
from the context no no no poetic license

484
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,428
anymore the grammar police are here and

485
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:06,259
we are linting so you can lint your

486
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:08,659
api's and make sure that it's following

487
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:10,789
the language or the standard to the code

488
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:12,649
it's really it's really very helpful

489
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,279
even though if at the time it's pointing

490
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,928
out your bugs

491
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,850
it might seem really annoying but then

492
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:20,600
when your app doesn't get breached it

493
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,980
feels good later throttling and resource

494
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,580
quotas oh my gosh I only have five

495
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,070
minutes left

496
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,869
okay well that's self-explanatory yeah

497
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,939
you should have been to Kate and then

498
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:30,918
you should authorize you should hide

499
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,649
what you can and not share any extra

500
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:36,830
information and please wait list the

501
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:39,199
HTTP verbs or methods that you use it's

502
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,510
a it's get and post and then everything

503
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,990
else just block it unless you

504
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:45,250
a really good reason okay modern tooling

505
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,540
so I'm gonna go through this really

506
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,030
quickly because we have five minutes and

507
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,420
I talk too much these are new types of

508
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,970
tools

509
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:55,420
I asked interactive application security

510
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:59,110
testing rasp this is like a laughs only

511
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:02,050
knives crappy way way better what apps

512
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,790
are slow okay stop it Tonya no I just

513
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,430
mean that I'm talking too much not that

514
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:07,840
I'll always make fun of laughs okay file

515
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,370
integrity monitoring which goes

516
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,810
hand-in-hand with application

517
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,669
waitlisting this is something that I

518
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,710
strongly advise people should put on

519
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,300
their servers so that only the things

520
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,730
that are supposed to run on your servers

521
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,860
run and nothing else cloud native

522
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,110
controls each one of the public cloud

523
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,850
providers has their own special things

524
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,560
that they have made specifically only

525
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,209
for their cloud if you are paying for

526
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,149
their service take advantage and use all

527
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,280
the free stuff you can adding security

528
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:34,510
to your DevOps pipelines I'm sure

529
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,550
there's been a lot of talk about that

530
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:41,080
and there will be tomorrow at 3:00 in

531
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:43,540
room 16 customizing your alerts

532
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,750
automating responses using server lists

533
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,879
and logic apps as triggers and I don't

534
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,740
know it's a type that call this new type

535
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,240
of tool but basically there's a whole

536
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,430
bunch of systems out there right now

537
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,410
which will inventory all of your public

538
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,690
assets and watch them and tell you when

539
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:00,970
scary stuff happens no one's come up

540
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,340
with a really cute acronym that sends an

541
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:06,160
asked or ASP yet but I'm sure someone

542
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:09,010
will okay modern tactics and then we're

543
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,500
done adding security to your DevOps

544
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,540
pipelines creating negative unit tests

545
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,230
instead of just positive ones breaking

546
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,790
security activities into Sprint's

547
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:20,290
turning contest results into unit tests

548
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,470
so you can have regressive security

549
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:26,680
testing tuning tools via automation and

550
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:29,110
efficiency automating a repository scans

551
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,480
it's just sitting there right why not

552
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,340
just take advantage and it's cetera et

553
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,230
cetera this is basically all I ever talk

554
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,709
about my talks like I'm a broken record

555
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,330
application security okay so oh yeah we

556
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:45,370
can't talk about dev suck-ups there's

557
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:47,470
not going to be time for that but I'm

558
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:52,320
trying to press the button and it's

559
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,320
going okay and

560
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:58,440
I'm gonna have to skip a few slides

561
00:21:54,809 --> 00:22:00,270
really sorry I've definitely done this

562
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,049
in 25 minutes before but maybe we

563
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:07,320
started late cloud security some apps

564
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:10,020
live in the cloud if your software

565
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,850
developer and you have an app that is

566
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,970
living in the cloud if the cloud is

567
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:17,370
wildly insecure you're still in trouble

568
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,720
okay and lastly this is a summary if

569
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,539
you're gonna take a photo of a slide

570
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,590
this is the slide you want and after

571
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,530
this I'm gonna give you some resources

572
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,789
so keep your phones out do I've have

573
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,330

00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:35,340
okay so resources all these resources

575
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:39,240

Bears

580
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:49,049
we really are women of security we're

581
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:51,600
gonna host the CTF tomorrow morning and

582
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:54,720
we're gonna crash our safe Tuesday night

583
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,149

I think I'm great and now let's

598
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,090
summarize what have we learned today we

599
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:42,090
learned some modern tools some modern

600
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:44,250
practices required so that we can secure

601
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,720
our apps we can't keep doing things the

602
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:49,530
old way if we want to secure things

603
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,809
developers and ops aren't going to wait

604
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:54,600
for us they're not so we have to get

605
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:58,049
with wherever they're going and follows

606
