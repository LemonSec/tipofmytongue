please note that this will be reducing a

48
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,798
lot of fake news that is out there

49
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,710
around bug bounty all right so let's

50
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,899
dive in some questions so for the hunter

51
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,290
out there I have some questions for you

52
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:18,540
first one is how often do you hunt

53
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:21,810
I could start not as often as I would

54
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,950
like trying to find a balance of not

55
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,650
spending too much time on your computer

56
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,660
has been a little bit hard but I want to

57
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,270
say a few hours a day if I get the

58
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,130
chance after work are you what I was

59
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,930
doing full time you know most of the day

60
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,940
eight nine hours a day but now I've

61
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,550
reduced a to maybe 20 hours 10 hours a

62
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,500
week just for my own sanity and also

63
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,430
I've tried to learn to be efficient so I

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,530
can redo less make more if I can yeah I

65
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,120
try to hack as much as possible it's

66
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,100
usually at least a few times a week

67
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,440
sometimes if you're on to something I'll

68
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,030
just grind for a week straight after

69
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,700
work and until 2:00 or 3:00 in the

70
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,290
morning I did do it full-time for a

71
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,810
little bit over a year and during that

72
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,910
period it varied also where I go on

73
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,320
vacation then come back and just sit out

74
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,620
for a couple weeks and then take a week

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,440
off and just try to keep I try to do it

76
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,299
as regularly as possible yeah no not as

77
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,900
often as I like it echoing been here

78
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:16,500
definitely significantly less than

79
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,780
before

80
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,760
it would used to be probably like tens

81
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,780
of hours a week but now because it is

82
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,328
still my day job is not where I want it

83
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,070
to be Roger that

84
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,380
okay so tanner we're gonna ask you this

85
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:33,150
question first which is how did you

86
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,109
start hunting and how did you become

87
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,480
successful at it yeah so I started I

88
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,489
guess back in the day I would do kind of

89
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,078
mini CTF sand kind of like small hacking

90
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,660
challenges that were set up there are

91
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,829
websites like hack the site that org

92
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,150
would make like an XSS challenge

93
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:52,859
something so you could learn with that

94
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:55,590
and this was maybe in 2004-2005 ish and

95
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:58,620
then didn't really know about bug

96
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,450
bounties and then once I started yeah I

97
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,769
guess hearing about it I realized that

98
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,358
oh this looks cool but it's probably

99
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:07,769
something I couldn't do

100
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:09,540
and then around 2016 I actually found a

101
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,700
bug and United while I was trying to

102
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,000
change my password submitted through

103
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,190
their bounty program and then

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,820
it's actually something that seems like

105
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:22,010
I could do it and just took off from

106
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,500
there and I became successful at it I

107
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,590
would say just from the resources that

108
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,940
are available I went through like every

109
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,150
single poll he disclosed report on

110
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:35,090
Hacker one at the time read this book

111
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,010
that Peter Warrick had written which was

112
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:40,039
like intra bug bounty and just learning

113
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,630
about like reports that I paid and what

114
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,590
actually like what was actually found in

115
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,830
the whole interaction between the

116
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:48,530
company and the hackers and kind of

117
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,330
replicated that I love Pete's buck by

118
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,909
the way if anyone has an read it you

119
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,840
should he has what packing 101 and I got

120
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,630
him Bugs Bunny

121
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,479
it is definitely a must read then same

122
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:03,050
question right back at you yeah I am I

123
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:05,240
got into backgrounds by accident kind of

124
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:10,160
I heard about both bark rotten hacker

125
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,390
won back in 2013 24 2014 one of my

126
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,550
buddies was just telling me how I

127
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,930
couldn't make money as hacking as having

128
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,180
hacked in years and he's like hey you

129
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,070
should make money from hacking and my

130
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,360
immediate thought was mmm kind of

131
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,710
sketchy I don't know if I want to get

132
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,450
into it and he's I just look up bug

133
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,700
bounties and that's where Yahoo was

134
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:28,400
still doing their own bug bounty program

135
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,039
on their site that akka static pager put

136
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,810
the names on there every month and when

137
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,550
they move to a platform is when I know I

138
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,790
found out about these platforms or more

139
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:39,350
programs a lot of it was just me jumping

140
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,750
in I like to I do things backwards

141
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,100
sometimes I jump into something and I

142
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,290
try to make sense of it and then learn

143
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,960
it as I go so I drove right into it with

144
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,120
Yahoo none of some of the paranoids are

145
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,620
here from years ago but I started just

146
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,970
hacking on Yahoo and anything that it

147
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,500
didn't make sense I didn't know how to

148
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,160
do I would just hook it up you know hack

149
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,290
this I was a good place to play around

150
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,200
there were a few limited resources there

151
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,450
was a vulnerable web app hack this site

152
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,099
I went through all of those just to like

153
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,349
understand the basics and while I was

154
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,450
going to learn I just jump right into it

155
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,320
was the best way to get hands-on

156
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,550
experience what about yourself

157
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,870
actually Mia so the way I got double

158
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,689
Granny's was through a friend of mine

159
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,239
who

160
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:22,769
a colleague I should say also a friend

161
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:24,568
he joined bugcrowd

162
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:26,039
several years ago and I did actually

163
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:28,349
hadn't heard of bug bounties until that

164
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,878
so that's how I got into it because he

165
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,979
urged me to become a researcher and

166
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:34,499
actually start testing and finding bugs

167
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,508
on the programs that Buckeye was hosting

168
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:38,219
but that's kinda how I got started and

169
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:40,669
then eventually did join the company as

170
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:43,229
well alright so the next question I have

171
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:46,859
remember once again this is AG mani

172
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:48,808
platform agnostic but what are some

173
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:53,969
issues you've dealt with when it comes

174
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:55,829
to reporting on bug bounty platforms so

175
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:59,579
some of the issues like that you'll come

176
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:00,839
across is like customer or the company

177
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,110
running the program might not consider

178
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,899
to be like as severe as you think it is

179
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,179
or is like it actually is as well as

180
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:12,839
they might not just want to hear about

181
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:14,758
it but presenting on the aura submitting

182
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,169
on a platform itself is usually a lot

183
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,899
better than actually having to reach out

184
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,549
and find like a security at or like a

185
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,110
support at alias to be able to try and

186
00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:24,929
track down somebody from their security

187
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,239
team so again having a bug bounty

188
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:28,739
platform actually being able to like

189
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:31,099
manage all that have like a main point

190
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:35,459
of contact certainly helps quite a lot

191
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:37,438
excellent yeah I think I mean bug on

192
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:38,999
your platforms are it's great because

193
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,379
they want happy companies and happy

194
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:42,479
researchers so they're pretty proactive

195
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,889
to make changes so if you do have an

196
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,529
issue with it they'll either release a

197
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:48,509
new feature or kind of change the way

198
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:50,279
something works so I thought that that

199
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,919
was really good but I think different

200
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,619
platforms work in different ways there

201
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,669
is for instance there's a platform where

202
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:57,719
they have different kinds of targets on

203
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,269
it but one of the requirements that you

204
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:02,998
have to tell all testing through a VPN

205
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:04,139
right so it's like there's some hackers

206
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:06,029
that actually don't want to do that for

207
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,379
various reasons it might be slower it's

208
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:11,459
just kind of more annoying to test

209
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,839
through that so I guess that's not a

210
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:15,289
problem with the platform but it's just

211
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:18,329
the way the platform works which is a

212
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:21,869
way that might not be conducive to all

213
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:24,239
researchers for me it's mostly the

214
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:26,249
communication aspect not just with the

215
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:28,900
platform but even the security engineers

216
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:31,479
on that company on the company's team

217
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,699
sometimes you know as triage members or

218
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,620
the security engineers they don't know

219
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,570
their product as good as we may know at

220
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,729
this point so the communication becomes

221
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,080
hard because first I don't know if they

222
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,460
understand what the thing that I found

223
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,839
because of their experience with the app

224
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,360
depending on how much they've dealt with

225
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,310
it I think communication is a very very

226
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,930
huge role in bug bonney's you know being

227
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,699
able to communicate your vulnerability

228
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,859
properly for them to understand the

229
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,690
impact and also understand you while

230
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,310
you're reporting especially when we work

231
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,630
with companies that are in a different

232
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,040
part of the world with maybe English is

233
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,390
on their first language the

234
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,250
communication was one of the hardest

235
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,689
things and I've gotten better at it

236
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,970
throughout the years to understand how

237
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,260
do I unify this that regardless of who

238
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,660
the other person is whether they're a

239
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,980
triage team or the work of their company

240
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,420
to understand exactly what I'm trying to

241
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,740
get across how to reproduce it and

242
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,569
understanding what the impact is on

243
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,130
their users or the infrastructures I

244
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,020
like that you brought up communication

245
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,689
that's like one of the big things that

246
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,400
in the bug running space especially you

247
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,690
have a lot of people that are submitting

248
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,150
that English is not their first language

249
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:31,510
so they're always runs into some

250
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:37,060
situation I was wondering have you ran

251
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:38,950
into any issues with companies not

252
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,449
really with the companies no a lot of

253
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,010
times the issues of how with the

254
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,660
companies is them not understand the

255
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,300
vulnerability because of their exposure

256
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,490
either their new engineer or I've never

257
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,260
seen this the said in future that I've

258
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,150
found they don't even know they existed

259
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,560
so the question is how do I make them

260
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,939
understand like just because you haven't

261
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,619
seen it yet as I mean it's not

262
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,480
vulnerable or because you don't ascend a

263
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,520
vulnerability the impact is in there and

264
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,320
that all goes back to communication and

265
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,930
how much information you provide and how

266
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,930
accurate and clear that description is

267
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:13,150
yeah I've had some issues in the past

268
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:15,040
with companies it's usually it revolves

269
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:16,660
around say I say something is of maybe

270
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,540
high severity and then they say no

271
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,529
that's it's a low sometimes the company

272
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,900
is right it's like that if they have

273
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:25,120
mitigation in place I can't see that if

274
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,250
they know that the impact is low because

275
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,110
maybe 1% of users actually visit this

276
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,089
part of the app then sure

277
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,770
that makes sense but there's some times

278
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,240
when you actually are pretty confident

279
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:37,209
that you think ok this is high severity

280
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,810
it's very exploitable not difficult to

281
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:40,430
find and

282
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,739
you pretty much have to go back and

283
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,339
forth trying to convince them that this

284
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,480
is higher severity and here's why

285
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:51,760
sometimes it works sometimes they see it

286
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,810
sometimes they don't but a lot of times

287
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,220
you know like you could kind of convince

288
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,390
them and then they'll be oh okay you're

289
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,220
right we didn't think of that or we

290
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,170
didn't know that it was this easily

291
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,510
exploitable and they'll either raise the

292
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,130
bounty or raise a severity actually I

293
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,170
kind of want to ask you a follow-up

294
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:10,250
question on that um with regards to

295
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:12,770
actually convincing companies how do you

296
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,690
exactly do that do you give them a

297
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,579
better proof of concept how do you kind

298
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,750
of walk around those eggshells without

299
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,850
like actually going against their rules

300
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,110
yeah

301
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,870
there's a few ways one is like a

302
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,640
one-click POC is it's the most valuable

303
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,020
thing you could have so it's like you're

304
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,400
trying to explain an account takeover

305
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,720
for instance and it's like maybe

306
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,430
somewhat theoretical where to go if you

307
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,710
do this and do this and copy this

308
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:38,660
request over here it's hard to follow

309
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,100
where if it's like okay log into your

310
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,430
account and click this link and notice I

311
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,110
just took over it so then that really

312
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,989
helped solidify like oh wow okay this is

313
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,260
like this is pretty bad something like

314
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,610
that there has been a case before we're

315
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,100
proving impact would have had to result

316
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,170
in hacking some third party which was

317
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,280
really hard to convey and say okay like

318
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,650
I don't want to have to hack this third

319
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,060
party but there are a bunch of third

320
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,630
parties that could possibly be hacked

321
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,849
that could be used to exploit this yeah

322
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,210
yeah building on Tanner's response there

323
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,800
so yeah that's one of the things is that

324
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,839
usually in most companies bounty briefs

325
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,459
they'll state that hey don't like prove

326
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,470
that there's a vulnerability there but

327
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,480
don't do the full exploit don't actually

328
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,470
extract any data right and then

329
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,150
obviously there's going to be certain

330
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,320
times where they don't think that it's

331
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,360
actually a vulnerability maybe because

332
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,520
they don't understand it but one of

333
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,740
those things that you can always do is

334
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,540
like say hey I can actually do the full

335
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,670
exploit do I have your full permission

336
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,740
like ask for permission first before

337
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,479
actually doing it so if they need extra

338
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,950
convincing that's one way to go about it

339
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,089
yeah the permission thing is very

340
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,339
important there's a couple of times

341
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:45,110
where I know like if I run a particular

342
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,329
command a site might go down and I don't

343
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,279
want to be responsible for it

344
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:50,839
sort of just asking for permission

345
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,369
there's also times when I describe the

346
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,379
things that I want to do but I'm kind of

347
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:55,489
afraid of doing on their website you

348
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:57,259
know especially when you're testing and

349
00:12:55,489 --> 00:13:00,110
prod with boundary programs it becomes a

350
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:02,179
little bit weird so just include the

351
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,139
things that you want to try and you know

352
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,579
I give them the benefit of the doubt to

353
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,769
believe me and give it a try and I can

354
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:09,049
even go as far as trying to craft a

355
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,160
payload or a POC that may work and they

356
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:11,929
can try it out and tell me if it

357
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,219
actually work on their hand and they

358
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:14,749
have the app they have the resources to

359
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,860
monitor and see if these things are

360
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:17,149
actually true they can go look at the

361
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,100
source code and see if you know these

362
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:21,379
claims are true so it doesn't hurt to

363
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,819
give them those claims and also ask them

364
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:24,230
if you don't want to try it I would love

365
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:25,368
to do it or do you have it they've you

366
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,689
know the environment where I could try

367
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:29,600
this or something like that that's

368
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:30,980
always been helpful excellent ok so we

369
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,379
talked a little bit about like the

370
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,199
issues with by baddies and companies

371
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:38,420
when you are a hunter yourself what are

372
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:40,609
some ways that they both can improve on

373
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,170
so on the bug bounty platform itself and

374
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,689
also for the companies that participate

375
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,399
in bug bounty so come again it comes

376
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:48,860
back to the communication feature it

377
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,749
never hurts to over communicate it

378
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,179
explain exactly what you're doing very

379
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:54,230
good descriptions again just to echo

380
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:56,988
what everyone else has already been

381
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:00,499
saying communicate some of the the best

382
00:13:56,989 --> 00:14:02,660
I should say is we so I'm sure all

383
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:04,819
platforms do this but they do review and

384
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,169
like kind of survey the crowd for which

385
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:07,339
like what's the best program what

386
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:08,959
program do you like the best it's not

387
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:10,579
the one that actually has the most

388
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,319
rewards the highest rewards it's

389
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:14,719
generally going to be the one that

390
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:17,540
communicates the best and has economy

391
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,360
king drinking a communication back and

392
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,589
forth between the company the platform

393
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,989
as well as the researchers so

394
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:25,429
over-communicate yeah a great

395
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:27,169
communication is definitely key in

396
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:30,649
anything we do even with bug bounties

397
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:32,629
I'm going even further allowing hackers

398
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:35,989
to interact either with the program

399
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:37,339
manager on the platform side or directly

400
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:39,019
the program manager on the company side

401
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:41,299
having a way of asking questions because

402
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,350
there's times where I look at a future I

403
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:43,610
don't understand what it's supposed to

404
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,209
do I don't know if it's a future or a

405
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,759
bug right avital hard

406
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:51,790
having those ways of asking game okay if

407
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,160
it is a future what is it not supposed

408
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,899
to do so I can exactly do that and

409
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,639
having communication and having the

410
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,889
ability to ask questions outside of a

411
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,600
report after the platform and directly

412
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,129
getting in touch with whoever runs a

413
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,499
program on either and platform or

414
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:07,360
company is very very helpful if it

415
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:08,920
wasn't for communication with the

416
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,869
company like Airbnb when I hack on them

417
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,550
if it wasn't for their engineers right

418
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:14,170
away answering my questions when I don't

419
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,089
know what I'm like what I'm dealing with

420
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:19,498
sometimes those better bugs that became

421
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:21,970
critical wouldn't have happened yeah

422
00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:23,139
definitely I call that but also one of

423
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,240
my favorite things to see when I'm not

424
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:28,059
gonna with the program is engagement

425
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,779
from the company's side it feels better

426
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,339
when you

427
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:32,170
I guess you interact with the engineers

428
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,629
over there and they could answer

429
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,979
questions for you but also maybe help

430
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:37,179
you escalate an incomplete bug right

431
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,649
it's like if you see something that's

432
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:40,209
absolutely terrible practice and it

433
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,800
looks really vulnerable and you think

434
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:43,589
there's something there but you can't

435
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,429
you can't get like a full exploit yet

436
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:46,389
it's good when it's a company that's

437
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:47,399
like hey we'll look into this and

438
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:49,569
they'll go and look at the code and

439
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,910
they'll like kind of help you with it

440
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:52,990
and you know if they could prove impact

441
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,889
with it also then you get the full

442
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:58,149
bounty that's I mean I'd run a program

443
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,670
at the company I work at and that's

444
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:02,259
something I try to do is I always I'm

445
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:04,509
open to questions if you think something

446
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:05,679
is a bug let me know multi-tow report it

447
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:08,079
and all investigated I'll try to

448
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,759
escalate on my end and I'll let you know

449
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,410
why we chose a certain severity for

450
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,249
something like list outlet the reasons

451
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:17,170
of oh well we had mitigations in like in

452
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:19,149
these ways which is why I paid out a

453
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,219
certain way I like that everyone keeps

454
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:23,499
bringing up communication it is like the

455
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,649
number one thing that can be improved on

456
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:27,879
for sure in all directions and it

457
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:29,259
definitely does bring you back to you

458
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:30,819
wanting to work with them again or

459
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:32,920
working on a program with them it's

460
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:33,459
definitely one of those what other

461
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,860
things

462
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:38,378
basically bring you back to that program

463
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:41,589
and also when sent advises you to look

464
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:44,559
at specific programs I like what Tanner

465
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:46,660
said the engagement from a company when

466
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,579
I see them that's if it programs managed

467
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,379
and I see them popping into the Inbox

468
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:51,699
it doesn't have to be a I don't care so

469
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:53,199
much about saying oh we found value in

470
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:54,199
this but also seeing them answer their

471
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,089
questions that I don't know

472
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,350
and directly interacting with me it

473
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,640
shows that they're invested they have

474
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,870
dinner there they're spending some

475
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,480
resources to answer all these questions

476
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,849
and also goes with you know how often

477
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,949
they expand their bug bounty program how

478
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,990
long have this scope in the same has it

479
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,730
been the same for three years or as I

480
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,910
gradually changed and became bigger and

481
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,130
bigger those play a huge role and

482
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,780
outside the monetary rewards and

483
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:20,810
engagement those are like a very big

484
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,270
impact on choosing programs yeah for me

485
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:25,250
one of my favorite things is working on

486
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,020
programs for products that I use because

487
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,260
you already understand it so you already

488
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,850
completed a bunch of the work by being

489
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,050
able to I guess if you know how how it

490
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,219
works and you could actually think of

491
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,260
some interesting owner abilities that

492
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,300
more along the business side or the

493
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,650
business logic side of it right so it's

494
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,030
like if you just dive into a program a

495
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,190
lot of times that it's just like some

496
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,620
huge enterprise software it's kind of

497
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,120
difficult to see like what the business

498
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,070
use case is and how to actually like

499
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,409
some clever ideas are being creative is

500
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,720
a little more difficult first as if it's

501
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,310
something like maybe uber lyft github

502
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,900
which are just products you use and you

503
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,850
could always just think of is there any

504
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,480
way to I don't know get free rides or

505
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:05,929
something you know so stuff like that a

506
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,030
big scope is cool I mean that's it's

507
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,890
pretty frustrating if you the scope is

508
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,180
so narrow that pretty much every link

509
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,680
you click ends up going to a domain

510
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,120
that's not in scope and then you don't

511
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,930
really have much to work with over there

512
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:21,139
and also communication like quick

513
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,910
payouts are great for momentum if you're

514
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,850
hacking on a program and they pay out

515
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,920
within a few days or sometimes in within

516
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,540
a day it really keeps you engaged and it

517
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,220
keeps you want to attack more versus if

518
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,540
it takes months to pay out you kind of

519
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,890
forget about it then you get the payout

520
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,300
and then you're like oh yeah there was

521
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:40,130
this program so yeah yeah engagement

522
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,139
time to pay out as and then kind of

523
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,100
building along the the large scope I

524
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,330
would say also open scope just so that

525
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,219
everything under the Sun under their

526
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,899
brand name is within scope obviously is

527
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,910
a little bit easier to find bugs because

528
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,830
you can find a vulnerability that exists

529
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,710
on maybe something that they don't even

530
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,470
know that they own so again a lot easier

531
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,630
to get paid out that way show of hands

532
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:06,080
how do you guys have actually done any

533
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,530
bug bounty before this is nice I'm

534
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,850
seeing a lot more hands that

535
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:14,550
like the previous year what other advice

536
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,709
you guys have for newbies in a sense

537
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:23,399
like besides learn the ins and outs of

538
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:25,670
burp suite and also to not give up this

539
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,980
is gonna sound a little too obvious but

540
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:30,990
learn the fundamentals like learned what

541
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,240
goes behind our website for it to be

542
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,830
built you don't have to become a full

543
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,080
stack developer but I understand the

544
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,659
super basic level of how a website works

545
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,610
you know what goes behind it before you

546
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,040
jump into breaking it and stay away from

547
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,959
play loads like stop focusing on payload

548
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,460
stop copy pacing things without

549
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,830
understanding it because when you copy

550
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,270
pasting things you miss a ton of bugs

551
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,070
because you don't understand the

552
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,870
fundamentals and you relying on someone

553
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:58,110
else's payload for it to work in your

554
00:19:54,870 --> 00:20:01,290
context and that's not how it works yeah

555
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:03,030
I totally agree with that also I mean

556
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,190
there's so many resources out there I

557
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,050
would definitely make use of those I

558
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,780
mean there's a lot of stuff for free I

559
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:11,940
mean there's just hacker once activity

560
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,889
is great it's it's the communication

561
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,660
it's basically as raw as you could get

562
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,640
it's the exact report that a researcher

563
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,650
sent to the company how the company

564
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,090
reacted to it what they felt about it

565
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,800
the communication between them and what

566
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,909
the pail was so if you're trying to get

567
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,070
into it you could say okay this is what

568
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,210
companies tend to care about if you

569
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,070
don't know how to write a report or how

570
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:32,220
to even phrase it it's all right there

571
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:36,270
for you like I said P orsk has a great

572
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:38,910
book to go through and I would say it is

573
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,290
to go through these as you're as you're

574
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,400
putting them into practice instead of

575
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,770
just reading a bunch of stuff and then

576
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,560
going into it later it should be done at

577
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,330
the same time and yeah I think once you

578
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,320
start finding bugs and it just keeps it

579
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:54,449
it keeps not feeding itself I would say

580
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,439
adding on top of all of that knowing how

581
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:00,030
to Google like Google is really a good

582
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,550
knowing how to use like Google's

583
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,629
modifiers like plus or minus or quotes

584
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,700
right so there's a number of them out

585
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,960
there to be able to filter for exactly

586
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,940
what you're looking for and chances are

587
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,860
someone has already asked the question

588
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,020
that you're asking maybe not specific to

589
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,949
the code that you're looking at but

590
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,990
guaranteed someone has already lasted

591
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,159
before and there's generally going to be

592
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,210
an answer out there

593
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,759
Google's gonna be your best friend

594
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,169
that's a very good advice just with how

595
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,340
many bug bounty hunters are out there

596
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:25,379
and how many write-ups come out every

597
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,119
week putting just the topic and the

598
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:29,248
keyword bug bounty next to it has always

599
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,619
had a solution for me it's always not

600
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:34,499
the first page somehow that's really

601
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:35,488
good advice I think company name if

602
00:21:34,499 --> 00:21:37,379
there's a specific company you're

603
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:39,059
looking for people will put a bunch of

604
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:43,590
write-ups on medium for specific company

605
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:48,629
which always helps definitely on BBS by

606
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:51,830
bounty farm bad if you don't know Ben is

607
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:53,728
under the founders of bug bounty form

608
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,158
I'm gonna ask some questions about

609
00:21:53,729 --> 00:22:00,529
triaging and Jeff you're gonna probably

610
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:03,690
answering all of them congratulations

611
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:06,210
but before I go into that part there's

612
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,309
been a massive rumor that goes around

613
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,799
about bug bunny that kind of wanted to

614
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:14,039
squash really fast which is but Benny

615
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,950
was not created to take over jobs for

616
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:20,039
security teams it was to complement your

617
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:22,710
security it's two very different things

618
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:25,139
and I just want to really push that out

619
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:28,320
there and any facts that you hear that

620
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:30,389
are not like that are before 2013 those

621
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,279
are not applicable today standards

622
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:35,699
alright now it's going to triaging

623
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:38,399
questions alright how do you handle out

624
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,129
of scope submissions so that's one of

625
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:42,809
those things is - before I get into that

626
00:22:41,129 --> 00:22:43,830
it's like if you're reading a bali brief

627
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:45,809
you participating

628
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,939
read what's in there read with the rules

629
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:49,619
make sure to stay in scope but that

630
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,139
being said again if you do submit

631
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:54,090
something that that's out of scope

632
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:55,408
expected to maybe perhaps not get the

633
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,599
monetary reward that you're hoping for

634
00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:00,599
but as far as like a triage perspective

635
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,189
we do have to notify the company that

636
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,950
who's running the program that hey

637
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,940
here's this bug it's out of scope but we

638
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,440
think you should look at it anyway just

639
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,239
because of the criticality of it or the

640
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,710
context of the vulnerability if it

641
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:14,460
exists like one of their partners or

642
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,779
their third party associated codes then

643
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,950
again they still want to know about it

644
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:18,299
but they just might not be able to pay

645
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,549
out because again might not be something

646
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:23,999
the control or is just something that's

647
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:25,950
not in scope at this time okay so what

648
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:28,529
happens if the triage I can't reproduce

649
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,800
the submission so again this does come

650
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,660
back

651
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,659
to communication so communication really

652
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:36,540
is key so if the platform comes back and

653
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,830
we're unable to reproduce it then we go

654
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,000
back to the researcher or whoever

655
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,350
submitted it to be able to ask for

656
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,850
additional information to be able to

657
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,439
make sure that it really is not

658
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,480
reproducible before market as such

659
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,370
because we want to be able to make sure

660
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,010
that we are doing our due diligence in

661
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,020
not just for our work but for the work

662
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,160
of whoever submitted it as well as the

663
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,139
company that's being submitted against

664
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,550
as well because again if it does turn

665
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,740
out to be a vulnerability we do want to

666
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:00,330
surface it to them but again we do want

667
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,250
to have that communication channel open

668
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,600
to be able to get more information maybe

669
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,460
walk through it with the researcher

670
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,629
maybe get out like a like a video

671
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,070
conferencing to be able to see what's

672
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,110
going on and see what they're saying I

673
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:12,480
think on that topic it's not just in the

674
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:14,969
triage teams to figure it out it's also

675
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,890
up to the hacker as a hacker if you know

676
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,450
you have a complex complex bug it

677
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,800
doesn't hurt to include a video please

678
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,410
don't go and make a video for every

679
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,270
single POC but if you have something

680
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:26,100
complex that you think the other party

681
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,990
can reproduce easily because you know

682
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,750
there's 40 steps included there's three

683
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,340
accounts included having a good POC with

684
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,980
the video and having some sort of a

685
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,879
proof or image that shows the

686
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,500
vulnerability helped so it's not always

687
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,580
on the triage team the hackers have to

688
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,560
also put on the effort to make sure

689
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,760
whatever they're communicating and going

690
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,590
back to the communication thing is

691
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,720
getting very well communicated to the

692
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,970
triage team as well also with that I

693
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,490
think it's important for the company

694
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,890
itself if you kind of skim the inbox of

695
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:56,040
reports coming in if it's a report

696
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:57,780
that's pretty deep in your the way your

697
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,830
app works it's possible that a triage

698
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,930
sure might not understand it right

699
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,980
because they're switching between so

700
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,060
many different reports from so many

701
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,160
different companies they don't have the

702
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:07,740
context of every app so if you're

703
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,090
working at the company you see that feel

704
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,620
free to step in and help you go hey I

705
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,050
could reproduce this or I understand

706
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,659
what they're saying because that would

707
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:18,330
help shortcut things a lot I wanted to

708
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:21,510
go back to what Ben was saying about

709
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:24,030
like taking videos there are a lot of

710
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:26,250
tools out there one of which I've I've

711
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:29,700
been like looking at for a long time now

712
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:33,960
I saw this open-source tool called repro

713
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:39,240
now re PR o & o w that's a pretty good

714
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:41,250
tool if you're doing like video and

715
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,890
network captures from your browser

716
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:46,230
um yeah so you might want to check it

717
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:48,540
out if you don't have a tool yet it can

718
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,070
do both Network and like video capturing

719
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,909
at the same time so I find it really

720
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:55,889
useful all right next question what

721
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:59,370
roles does the platform control versus

722
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,870
the company control so a lot of it is

723
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:05,250
going to be controlled by the company

724
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:06,959
itself there are like suggestions that

725
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,700
the platform will make due to our

726
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,920
experience our history with running

727
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,090
these types of programs with a ton of

728
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,920
other companies but again it's

729
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:15,929
ultimately going to be up to the company

730
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,520
itself whose program it is that

731
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,990
determines what the actual rules are

732
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,680
because again is it is their program

733
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:24,720
they are paying out the reward so again

734
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,460
it's under their control typically but

735
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,220
it is up to the platform to be able to

736
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,600
make those suggestions if suggestions or

737
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:35,880
if something needs to be changed or

738
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:37,439
updated all right um next one I have for

739
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,880
you is what are some of the most

740
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,650
interesting submissions you've

741
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:46,710
encountered and I do know you shouldn't

742
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:48,210
state any company names trying to speak

743
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,520
a little bit more broadly about this and

744
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:52,470
not mention specific companies or like

745
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,810
researcher names just something in

746
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,280
general is that we do get from like a

747
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,899
lot of new people that maybe don't

748
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,910
really understand security a whole lot

749
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,400
it's like kind of like the weird ones

750
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:05,550
where like a there's a grammatical error

751
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,990
on your on the website give me $50 right

752
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,610
don't do that

753
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,530
likewise be able to prove that the

754
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,600
vulnerability exists don't just argue

755
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,129
for argument's sake include all the

756
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,139
reproduction steps because again it's

757
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,600
it's one of those things where we do

758
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,250
have to be able to actually believe in

759
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,110
and validate that is a real

760
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,840
vulnerability so there's numerous times

761
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,939
that we do have to just mark things as

762
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,770
not reproducible because it might not

763
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,630
actually be a boner ability itself I

764
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:34,350
think if you can't answer the question

765
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:36,000
of what now like what can I do with this

766
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,860
thing if you can't answer that on your

767
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,530
own before you like it so what question

768
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,409
okay I see this thing so what does the

769
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,580
answer that then don't file it like if

770
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,680
you don't have an answer to concrete

771
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,260
answer you can back up with something

772
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,580
that you have found don't report it yeah

773
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,500
I like I like what you could put the

774
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,310
impact of the vulnerability in the title

775
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,740
where it's like

776
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:58,720
xxx leads to account takeover where it's

777
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,890
like very tangible just right reading

778
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,310
the title you could see what the impact

779
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,630
is and then you know it's like a valid

780
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:08,200
issue right it's like it's clear if it

781
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:09,880
to everybody all right um

782
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,670
then and Jeff this questions for you

783
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,610
what fears do bug bounty platforms have

784
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:17,560
with researchers and companies

785
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:19,600
besides miscommunication and taking over

786
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,760
or something you wanna go for a spin

787
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,830
yeah I mean I'm just gonna go back to

788
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,410
the communication thing I worked with

789
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,530
our mediation team very closely and a

790
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:31,090
lot of times what I see is the two

791
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:33,220
parties don't understand each other

792
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,419
they're both saying the same thing going

793
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,000
in full circles

794
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,350
and they're just not understanding

795
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,970
what's going on and that's the the

796
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,129
biggest thing is why I brought up that

797
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,750
communication thing is unless we can get

798
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,670
all three of us it's not just the

799
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,040
programs and the honkers it's a program

800
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,720
platform and the hackers all three of us

801
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,149
do speak the same language the same way

802
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,950
for this to work and my biggest fear is

803
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,200
that when they don't speak to each other

804
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,730
they're following out happens and trying

805
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,260
to explain like it's not you know

806
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,360
there's a perception of misperception of

807
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,680
like oh they don't want to pay it's not

808
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,419
so much that it doesn't come out of the

809
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,500
engineers pocket they're not paying for

810
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,510
us personally they're not using their

811
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,680
own credit card their giant corporations

812
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,540
in some cases I have hundreds of

813
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,370
thousands of millions of dollars in

814
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,500
$1,000 bounties and anything they pay

815
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:16,360
that you know twice a day or 20 times a

816
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,640
week sometimes with some companies and

817
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,750
it all comes down to making sure you are

818
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,490
being respectful

819
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,260
you're not crossing any lines you're not

820
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,970
pushing things too much and you're very

821
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,740
clear in what you are explaining to this

822
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,720
company and they think that keeps me up

823
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,920
at night is sometimes those things not

824
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,260
happening and not being able to

825
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,930
communicate very clearly lots of

826
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,690
mediation on the by battey front for

827
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:39,340
sure yeah so again communication is very

828
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,980
key and one of the things that kind of

829
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:44,500
like we have as a fears like kind of

830
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,530
like the the platform is especially with

831
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,970
companies is them not only like not

832
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:51,070
having enough money but again it's that

833
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:53,560
communication feature right so if like

834
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,480
they want a bug bounty think about this

835
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,649
way there's and I get a lot of

836
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,420
researchers don't ever think about this

837
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,010
way but there's a budget I can Ben was

838
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,350
saying that it's not the engineer that

839
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,460
pays out it's not even like even the

840
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,409
security engineer right it's not even

841
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,270
their team right it's the budget that's

842
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,130
been allocated

843
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,139
them so they might run out of budget

844
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,550
they might not have enough to be able to

845
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,170
pay high reward so even though I might

846
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,928
be like a really critical vulnerability

847
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:17,400
on a really big name-brand they still

848
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:19,340
might not be able to pay out as much

849
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,450
even though they might have like

850
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,399
billions or trillions of dollars in that

851
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,900
worth right so it's again comes down to

852
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,220
budget how much they're allocated so

853
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,780
something to always keep in mind

854
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,580
especially for like the researcher side

855
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,320
but again that's kind of like a fear

856
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,399
that you have as the platform to be able

857
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,559
to make sure that we want to keep the

858
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,550
researchers happy as well to be able to

859
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,178
make sure they are paid for their time

860
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:43,320
and work actually um if you don't mind

861
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:45,750
I'm curious about so when it comes to

862
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,820
like companies and their budgets and you

863
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:51,710
know let's let's keep this like pretty

864
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:55,770
drunk general like generic um do you

865
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:59,130
sometimes or often see companies that

866
00:30:55,770 --> 00:31:01,350
you know might be low on the budget or

867
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:03,600
like resource side where they can't

868
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:06,059
really respond quickly if I'm kind of

869
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,740
curious like what the trend is it

870
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:09,178
happens from time to time but we

871
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,309
generally try to set those expectations

872
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:13,530
before the program launches so before

873
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:15,720
the researchers even see it just so that

874
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,910
they can plan for themselves and again

875
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,530
it's even before in like the entire

876
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,640
process of when they purchase right we

877
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,860
want to make sure that they understand

878
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,300
there does need to be a program manager

879
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,520
or a program owner on the cut on the

880
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,530
company side to be able to like receive

881
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,330
the submissions and be able to make sure

882
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,899
that they respond with in a timely

883
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,699
manner

884
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,380
maybe not necessarily fixing them right

885
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,030
away but at least being able to respond

886
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,130
to be able to make sure that we serve

887
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:39,570
you paid out for their time so it kind

888
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,040
of does vary but it's it's happening

889
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,780
less and less often now because again

890
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,520
it's bug bounties are starting to become

891
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,200
a little more popular a little bit more

892
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,670
well-known and so companies are starting

893
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,429
to accept that fact and be able to

894
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:56,309
allocate more resources to security in

895
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:59,160
general not so much to that but also

896
00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:01,110
like I see a lot of hackers on Twitter

897
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,450
mostly bringing up the fact that why is

898
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,520
it this company paying a bounty I know I

899
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,620
so people are laughing they understand

900
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,770
where I'm going with this there is a lot

901
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:12,239
of work that goes behind the scene to

902
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,980
happen both on a

903
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,390
and I have to do a lot of work to make

904
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,610
these companies and customers get on

905
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,620
board with these things and also other

906
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,479
customers and the security teams have to

907
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,260
work with a number of folks to make this

908
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,360
happen

909
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,520
PR is one of them legal teams are

910
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,780
another one and when money gets involved

911
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,700
socially when you're paying money to a

912
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,350
different country a country where you

913
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,300
don't even have an office things get a

914
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,429
little tricky so my biggest thing is

915
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,260
give it some time the spark banners are

916
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,390
still new you know security itself is a

917
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,550
little new but working with hackers and

918
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,800
a crowd source or a backer power and

919
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,149
security it's very very new it takes

920
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,220
time it's not going to happen overnight

921
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,380
but I would much rather have the company

922
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,240
have a volunteers closure program than

923
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,100
me getting a seasoned deceased in a mail

924
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,250
that tells me to screw off and not go

925
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,020
deliver again

926
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:01,920
okay so we're gonna go into a company

927
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:04,920
triaging um are you ready Maria this is

928
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,960
this is gonna be all you now okay what

929
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:10,560
kind of hoops do bug battery ports go

930
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,490
through once it's submitted okay um so

931
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:18,659
this might be like a long winding answer

932
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:22,410
and I'm gonna talk a little bit on what

933
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:24,480
happens right after we get a report so

934
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:27,720
right after we got a report we don't

935
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,720
like necessarily see it ASAP

936
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,860
um so it depends per company like

937
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,980
whether or not they have their own

938
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:39,780
program going on or you know if they're

939
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:42,030
working like with a platform and you

940
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,889
know there there are other ways to like

941
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,750
go about actually receiving that

942
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:49,230
information and some people you know

943
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:52,260
like depending on the bug bounty program

944
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:55,470
or vulnerability disclosure program they

945
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:58,530
will just get stuff in the mail like for

946
00:33:55,470 --> 00:34:00,120
an email to security at and depending on

947
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:02,639
the company maybe they're not even

948
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,959
looking at that email too often so you

949
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,740
know it has to go through proper

950
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,380
channels

951
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,050
so given that you know when once the

952
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,750
report goes in through proper channels

953
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:16,170
if the company does have a program going

954
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:18,989
on within within the company usually

955
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:21,420
like with engineering teams big or small

956
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:22,199
there is a software development

957
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,210
lifecycle

958
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,710
and

959
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,830
I'm gonna be speaking from more of an

960
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:30,470
agile company side you know people

961
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:35,418
having scrum teams with Sprint's like

962
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:37,580
two weeks one week cycles and I think

963
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:40,759
the big part there is these people

964
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:44,299
already have like planned work and the

965
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,649
thing is when you have emerging work you

966
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,480
still have to work with different

967
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:49,429
departments if they have a product

968
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,440
manager they have a product owner if

969
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:53,599
they have a project manager you they

970
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,920
also have to like talk to those people

971
00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:01,700
to get that fix within within their like

972
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,970
regular cycles and that's only for the

973
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:08,689
fix another thing is that when a

974
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:10,669
security representative at the company

975
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,910
looks at a report they also have to

976
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:16,640
figure out on their side if you know if

977
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:20,750
this is a valid report and they also

978
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:24,740
have to like calculate the cbss score

979
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:27,470
and if you haven't heard of CB SS it's

980
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:32,479
common vulnerability scoring system and

981
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:35,209
it's how how some people decide how

982
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:39,290
important or how severe a particular

983
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:41,720
vulnerability is so this is usually seen

984
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:45,440
like when it comes to platforms they

985
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,879
might ask you how how rep reducible is

986
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,950
it can you reproduce it within the

987
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:54,200
network or a physical that sort of thing

988
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:57,830
so once a security team you know figures

989
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:00,109
out the CB SS or sometimes they don't in

990
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:02,119
which case they will have to like go

991
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:04,640
back to the engineering teams that are

992
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:06,890
responsible for that product because no

993
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,740
one person can know like the entire

994
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:12,770
scope of the company or like all the

995
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,868
products they have to go back to the

996
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:17,660
engineering team sometimes and ask them

997
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:19,730
hey how does this work or you know if

998
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,618
you're not well-versed in mobile

999
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,510
applications you'll have to go back to

1000
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:26,210
the mobile team get someone on their

1001
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:29,540
team and figure out the proper

1002
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:32,180
communication there so it depending on

1003
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,950
how busy those other teams are there's a

1004
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,379
lot of like talking between different

1005
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:40,210
people in a company

1006
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:43,279
however you know if if a particular

1007
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:47,240
vulnerability is like obviously severe

1008
00:36:43,279 --> 00:36:49,970
and you know it gets expedited every now

1009
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,279
and then like oh my god this is super

1010
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:54,019
serious for example like this handle

1011
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:57,740
this is a credit card information

1012
00:36:54,019 --> 00:37:00,558
problem like that one might be expedited

1013
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:03,109
and then you got like all hands on deck

1014
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,539
something like that so you know it

1015
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:06,859
really depends on the particular

1016
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:08,869
vulnerability otherwise it has to go

1017
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:12,769
through multiple cycles multiple people

1018
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:15,470
and then once a security representative

1019
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:18,649
finally like figures out okay this it's

1020
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:20,808
this serious this is the fix and then

1021
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:24,619
this is how much we're going to pay and

1022
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:26,480
then that's when they can go back to the

1023
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:29,599
security researcher and give them the

1024
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,130
proper bounty all right so this question

1025
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,740
is for like everyone who can answer

1026
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:35,779
which is what fears do companies have

1027
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,848
when entering bug bounties space and

1028
00:37:35,779 --> 00:37:40,509
starting that I want to also include

1029
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:43,700
vulnerability disclosure program so vdps

1030
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:45,769
such as like testing pre-production

1031
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,939
NDA's and so on what are some of the

1032
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:51,229
issues that you have guys seen so from

1033
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:54,559
the company perspective is that the

1034
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:56,240
questions yes so a lot of so when we

1035
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,759
speak to customers and this is a little

1036
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,750
less prevalent now now that again it bug

1037
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:01,759
bounties are starting to become a little

1038
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,109
bit more than norm we used to hear a lot

1039
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:04,490
of like how do I know I can trust

1040
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:06,740
someone how do I know I can trust a

1041
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,939
hacker or the researcher right and it's

1042
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,970
one of those things where you have to

1043
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,799
just basically understand that it's

1044
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,720
there's already people out there that

1045
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:17,660
are going to try and attack the website

1046
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,368
or hack the website it's just matters of

1047
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,779
like harnessing the people that want to

1048
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:22,789
do it for good and again it's one of

1049
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:24,319
those things where someone with

1050
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:26,930
malicious intent doesn't need a bug

1051
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:29,299
bounty platform to be able to actually

1052
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,769
go out and harm some company out there

1053
00:38:29,299 --> 00:38:32,900
right they again they don't need a

1054
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:34,758
platform to do that they don't need some

1055
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,019
rules or some bullying disclosures your

1056
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:38,150
program do they're already gonna do it

1057
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:39,618
so again it's one of those things where

1058
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,839
it's again becoming a little bit more

1059
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,450
accepted for the researchers in that and

1060
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,150
act

1061
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:47,578
hacked hackers out there excuse me to be

1062
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,859
able to to figure things out but that's

1063
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,240
that's one of them yeah I don't think

1064
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:52,770
malicious hackers are going to come

1065
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,819
knocking I give you a heads up I agree

1066
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,430
that's one of the biggest things that

1067
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,640
you understand like out sort of even not

1068
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:01,049
knowing these hackers if if your stuff

1069
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,279
are vulnerable you want to hear from

1070
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,550
these hackers who are willing to help

1071
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,920
you

1072
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,900
versus find out after all your data has

1073
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,520
been dumped I think that's the biggest

1074
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,530
thing to have a little bit of trust to

1075
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,670
understand these platforms I've worked

1076
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,200
with these hackers that have long-term

1077
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,240
relationships I've made some of these

1078
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,680
folks and there are some measures

1079
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,328
there's for us to control it yeah

1080
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:24,720
something that I guess is pretty scary

1081
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:25,800
is testing their testing on prod the

1082
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,240
security team does not want to be

1083
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,859
responsible if the site happens to go

1084
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,328
down so it's not necessarily going to be

1085
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:32,190
a hackers fault right say if there's

1086
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:35,460
some endpoint where when you hit a it

1087
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:36,990
just shuts down the whole system it's

1088
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,280
happened before I'm not like I've

1089
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:42,089
accidentally triggered that a company

1090
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,440
before I felt really bad about it but at

1091
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,970
the same time it's like they had to do

1092
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,069
some explaining to the engineering teams

1093
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:48,990
and to the product team or whoever else

1094
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:51,869
saying like oh why'd you start the

1095
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:53,848
security program that just completely

1096
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:55,680
just destroyed our system I mean I think

1097
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,210
you're on our side and you know I'm sure

1098
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,848
there are conversations like that so I

1099
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:04,319
guess you want to be careful it's it's a

1100
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:05,520
good idea to start with a smaller group

1101
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,410
for instance like a private program at

1102
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,700
first I would say and kind of wrapped up

1103
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,230
from there versus just going public

1104
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,419
altogether

1105
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:15,060
all right off the bat because you never

1106
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,510
know if there's something that's coated

1107
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,140
poorly that will choke the system I

1108
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,180
completely agree with that

1109
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,759
you should start first private go public

1110
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,589
because you don't know what you're gonna

1111
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,720
get into you at the very beginning it's

1112
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:32,279
very good to first put your foot in

1113
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:36,419
slowly not just jump in okay call it

1114
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,880
crawl walk and right now exactly so

1115
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:42,359
another thing that kind of crosses my

1116
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,069
mind or yeah comes across when you know

1117
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:46,290
when you talk about like fierce that

1118
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:48,060
companies have would be the fact that

1119
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,740
you know especially for smaller

1120
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,480
companies or companies that don't even

1121
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,250
have a proper security team that they'll

1122
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,200
be like how do you even deal with this

1123
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,830
and you already have like so much work

1124
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,569
to do how

1125
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,430
do we roll that in and that's something

1126
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:00,360
for the companies to actually like

1127
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:03,060
figure out

1128
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,190
I mean security is a pretty big deal and

1129
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:08,370
you know whether or not you can actually

1130
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:10,260
have a full bug bounty program is

1131
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:12,029
definitely up to the company and you'll

1132
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:14,250
have to see if it's right for you but at

1133
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,900
least like have that baseline VDP or a

1134
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:18,450
vulnerability disclosure disclosure

1135
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,640
program so that if someone does find

1136
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:23,939
something at least they have a means of

1137
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,440
notifying you aside from like resources

1138
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,560
the thing that we talked about earlier

1139
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,280
with like budget and the people that are

1140
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,960
going to be working on this program

1141
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,240
there is also going to be a matter of

1142
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,030
communication within the company like

1143
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,419
how do you establish communication with

1144
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:44,370
other teams and you know it's it takes a

1145
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,470
whole village to figure this out it's

1146
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:48,359
not just the security team but you also

1147
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,430
have to work with like product and

1148
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:54,300
engineering and other business units

1149
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:56,460
within your org Jeff anything you want

1150
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,970
to add to that oh that's that's very

1151
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:02,520
well set yeah okay so if you guys have

1152
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,529
heard different perspectives from the

1153
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,810
hunter side to the bug bounty platform

1154
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:10,260
to the company side I want to talk about

1155
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:12,690
kind of the future and one of the things

1156
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,620
I am if you know about me is that I'm

1157
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:18,810
very Pro bilateral trust that means we

1158
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:20,970
need to have every company should have a

1159
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:22,710
vulnerability disclosure program and

1160
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:25,379
you're going to need a manager to handle

1161
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:29,730
that too so I want to ask some questions

1162
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:31,440
around bilateral trust and as well what

1163
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:35,010
you guys see in the future for a bug

1164
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,540
bounty so first question for you is do

1165
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:39,210
you believe we will ever have bilateral

1166
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:41,730
trust amongst us such as safe harbor if

1167
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:47,640
so what is needed right now to make all

1168
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:49,320
parties move forward yeah this this

1169
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,569
comes again back to the communication

1170
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,890
piece everybody does need to have

1171
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:55,380
communication between all parties

1172
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:57,690
involved and especially in order to gain

1173
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,790
that trust and this is a little bit more

1174
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:02,790
on the companies to be able to handle is

1175
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:04,290
having like some sort of like legal

1176
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:06,210
language to be able to promote safe

1177
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:08,100
harbor to be able to protect the

1178
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,470
researchers who are doing the testing

1179
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,140
and

1180
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:12,580
the submitting on their program so it

1181
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,529
does have to start a little bit more on

1182
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:17,020
the company side to be able to make sure

1183
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:18,730
that not only do they trust the the

1184
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,099
researchers but that the researchers can

1185
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:23,170
trust them as well so that's probably

1186
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,760
one of the biggest starting points in

1187
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:26,349
order to keep moving forward with this

1188
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,790
is to make sure that we can get

1189
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:29,680
companies on board so we can get again

1190
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:32,890
more companies more researchers on board

1191
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,779
with it I'd like to add to that so when

1192
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:38,140
it comes to companies like you know you

1193
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:41,200
mentioned that there should be like

1194
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:43,690
proper language and everything so one

1195
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,779
there should be like really a really

1196
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:51,550
good legal perspective on it you need to

1197
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:54,820
properly like address the fact that some

1198
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:57,760
people might be scared and doing just

1199
00:43:54,820 --> 00:44:00,099
legalese might be difficult so having

1200
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,410
the same text the same legal text and

1201
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:05,020
easier to understand birds like the

1202
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:08,470
bottom point is yes you can do this no

1203
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:11,140
you shouldn't do that or yes you can but

1204
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:15,129
ask us first so those kinds of like easy

1205
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:18,580
to understand um I don't know uh rules

1206
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:21,099
would be very helpful as well another

1207
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,230
thing that I'd like to say about you

1208
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:25,859
know like the future of bilateral trust

1209
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:28,900
is that there has to be more awareness

1210
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:31,450
around like the community in general and

1211
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:34,200
not just this community but also like

1212
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:36,310
people outside the security circles

1213
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:39,790
companies that might not even have

1214
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:41,980
security teams being the news for

1215
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:44,830
example like there's so many companies

1216
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:47,020
out there that don't have a security

1217
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:52,000
team or you know they're always afraid

1218
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:54,009
of these hackers you know out there

1219
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,940
wearing the black hoodies with the

1220
00:44:54,010 --> 00:45:00,430
balaclavas yeah and they don't

1221
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:03,220
understand what's going on you know so I

1222
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:04,720
think awareness is a really big aspect

1223
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,419
here and it's gonna take some time

1224
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,848
I think assuming good intent also plays

1225
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,640
a big role on both sides hackers and

1226
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:13,750
customers or bug bounty programs

1227
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,540
assuming that there is good intentions

1228
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,980
the hackers are here to help you and the

1229
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,960
customers or the programs are here

1230
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,760
because they want to work with you

1231
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,290
there is no bad intent to screw anybody

1232
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,609
out of everything or have to do

1233
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,770
something on purpose when things go

1234
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:28,810
wrong it could be you could come off as

1235
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:30,970
you know malicious but in some cases

1236
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:36,040
just not understanding that and seeing

1237
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:37,930
the whole picture honestly I think that

1238
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,630
every single company should have a

1239
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:42,399
policy that is easy to understand like

1240
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,140
if English is second language you should

1241
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,570
still be able understand how many guys

1242
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:48,609
have actually read user agreements I

1243
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:51,460
mean if you have an Apple phone how many

1244
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:55,779
times will you actually read any of the

1245
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:58,210
updates exactly point me I think a very

1246
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:00,190
simple policy is very important to have

1247
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:01,720
knowing what's in scope what's a scope

1248
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,280
being and we'll communicate that from a

1249
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,799
company's perspectives very important

1250
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,349
have a email that people can actually

1251
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,180
write to you to tell you I found this

1252
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:13,180
vulnerability how many of you guys have

1253
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:15,580
spent hours or days and just have given

1254
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:18,730
up reporting something in this room it

1255
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:20,529
is so common you should also be able to

1256
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:22,390
know what are the rewards that you might

1257
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:25,210
get as well so having something like

1258
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:27,009
that is extremely important how many of

1259
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:32,260
you guys have heard of disclosed I owe

1260
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:34,540
raise your hand okay honestly check it

1261
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:36,520
out if you are someone who likes to look

1262
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:40,060
for vulnerabilities you should know of

1263
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:42,280
it I have some stickers for you a very

1264
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:47,259
last question and we have to wrap this

1265
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:53,950
up the last question is what do you see

1266
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:56,230
in the future for a bug bounty I think

1267
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:57,640
there's going to be a point where more

1268
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,800
companies are going to be either

1269
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,618
adopting a bug bounty or a vonda's

1270
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,170
closure program either by choice or by a

1271
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:06,849
government regulation I don't think

1272
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:09,550
we're too far from it I also think that

1273
00:47:06,849 --> 00:47:11,230
you know throughout the future in the

1274
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:14,020
next 3-4 years there's going to be a lot

1275
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:15,520
more education happening on both ends

1276
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:17,440
educating hackers on how to work with

1277
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,270
customers and also educating everybody

1278
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,980
in the world why does should work with

1279
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,230
hackers and how did it work with them I

1280
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:25,359
think once those two happened and I

1281
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:27,099
think when it is hacking and bug bite

1282
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:29,290
has become more mainstream and a big

1283
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:31,150
part of a security culture

1284
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:33,820
yeah I think more company's going to

1285
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,570
start opening them up I think we're

1286
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,070
already starting getting a lot more

1287
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,420
hackers on the platforms which is

1288
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:39,910
awesome

1289
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:42,460
there are hacking events and there's new

1290
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,690
faces at them all the time now new

1291
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,430
research is constantly coming out

1292
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:47,230
there's a lot of attention on it now so

1293
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:49,960
I think it's just gonna keep progressing

1294
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:52,230
and it'll be really easy to submit a

1295
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:56,560
vulnerability in the future and yeah

1296
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:57,880
hopefully more companies do adopt some

1297
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,460
of those legal languages of regarding

1298
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:03,550
safe harbor such as like disclosed iOS

1299
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:06,160
language but again since security is

1300
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,300
relatively new to the world and it's not

1301
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,609
really that new it's just people are

1302
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,570
becoming aware of it it's starting to

1303
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,740
become like one of those things where

1304
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:13,420
you can actually have a major in that in

1305
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:15,910
college now there's a lot of training

1306
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,670
courses right so a lot more people are

1307
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:20,140
becoming to be involved in it as well as

1308
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,960
learning about it as well as being able

1309
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:25,029
to actually do it themselves so not only

1310
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,070
will there be a lot more researchers

1311
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,450
hackers out there but there also be just

1312
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,130
like the general public knowing about it

1313
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,560
too so I think bug bounty can only go

1314
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:35,290
forward from this point in time yeah

1315
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,210
another thing is that I know that not

1316
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:39,130
all countries are pretty aware of bug

1317
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:42,760
bounties so far and you know there's a

1318
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:45,640
lot of a lot of improvements that can be

1319
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:48,640
done outside of the world that we know

1320
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:51,730
like the US for example on Europe Canada

1321
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:55,270
all sorts of countries I do know for one

1322
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:58,570
that bug bounty is kind of like starting

1323
00:48:55,270 --> 00:49:00,820
up in the Philippines I do know a few

1324
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:05,080
people over there there's a couple of

1325
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:07,000
companies that focus on like as a bug

1326
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,920
bounty platform in the Philippines

1327
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,690
specifically so you know it's it's

1328
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,870
gaining traction somewhere else in the

1329
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:17,560
world I just want to say thank you guys
