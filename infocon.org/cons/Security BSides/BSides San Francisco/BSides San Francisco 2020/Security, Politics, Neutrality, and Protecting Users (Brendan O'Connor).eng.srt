1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
hello so yes you're all welcome to

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,600
heckle me on twitter my twitter handle

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,189
is USS joined it's also at the bottom

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,290
corner of every slide however since I'm

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,969
in the IMAX theatre that means that

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,489
those in the first five rows can't see

7
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:17,340
it but it won't change from slide to

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,529
slide I promise so I want to talk to you

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,410
all about politics neutrality and the

10
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,359
work we do as security professionals we

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,130
have one job as security people and

12
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,720
sometimes we tell ourselves this is it

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,460
right I fight for the users which is

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,080
actually a misquote the original quote

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,500
in the original movie was that guy over

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,629
there he fights for the users but this

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,519
isn't actually our job I mean super cool

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,020
to see yourself as Tron guy acting as

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,329
though eager to duel to the death with a

20
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,059
giant panda and a fancy bear and a

21
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,680
grumpy NSA but this isn't actually Fight

22
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,839
Club super cool cyberpunks effects

23
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,079
edition now with more lasers that go pew

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,730
pew pew pew the problem with I fight for

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,340
the users is that it focuses on how

26
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,260
we're not the users how we're cool and

27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,739
we're separate and we're laser enabled

28
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,629
and we're cyber whatever that means I

29
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,369
think that's an issue but it seems

30
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,570
really appealing at first to many of us

31
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,220
the ones of us who grew up reading

32
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,110
science fiction focused on how one day

33
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,150
we'll get to fly away and upload our

34
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,220
consciousness into this cloud or go seek

35
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,740
out new life and new civilizations among

36
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,658
the stars technologists have been told

37
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,060
for decades that we're the ones who get

38
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,299
to save the universe and while most of

39
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,119
us don't exactly believe that like not

40
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,650
consciously the meme that were special

41
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,530
and different and above all else

42
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,630
separate from the normies has persisted

43
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,549
for many of us and it affects our work

44
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,140
and our relationships with others and it

45
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,259
affects how we see ourselves as a

46
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,450
profession this separation from the

47
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,280
users is what we as technologists and

48
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,740
particularly as security people pretend

49
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,390
to makes us special somehow when we

50
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,339
refer to users is the weakest link and

51
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,409
when we hate on people who can't be

52
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,759
trusted not to click on what we're

53
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,439
really doing the setting ourselves apart

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,939
because after all we all know not to

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,529
click on things oh I've never

56
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,389
successfully clicked on a fish and if

57
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,530
you believe that don't talk to any

58
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,770
purple teams that companies I've worked

59
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,509
at so when we're different when we tell

60
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,179
ourselves we don't need to get involved

61
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,760
we're above the fray we're above the

62
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,690
pesky concerns of mere mortals and we're

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,000
neutral

64
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,070
in other words so this talk is gonna

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,050
discuss this meme in the detail what

66
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,930
neutrality and separation really mean a

67
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,460
bit about the history in tech what this

68
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,040
meme causes for our relationship to

69
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,960
society and what we need to do now and

70
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,030
this isn't gonna be a real good talk to

71
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,920
give a real big disclaimer for so here's

72
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,390
mine I do not speak for my current

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,640
employer or any of my former employers

74
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,140
my clients the staff 1962 World's Fair

75
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,730
held in Seattle that built you the fine

76
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,769
thing guru is the space Neil and also a

77
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,269
pointless monorail or the cast of the

78
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,340
movie dr. Strangelove or how I learned

79
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,170
to stop worrying and love the bomb I'm

80
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,360
also not your lawyer which is just a

81
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,890
generically a good thing to say this

82
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,350
talk is not about legal advice but

83
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,119
please if you see parts of this talk and

84
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,730
think their legal advice to you seek

85
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,650
professional help immediately

86
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,290
so neutrality as a concept is actually

87
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,020
tied up with another concept from law of

88
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,340
sovereignty to be in the sole control of

89
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,960
your destiny so we're gonna start by

90
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,030
discussing how sovereignty came about

91
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,270
and then we'll zoom in on how neutrality

92
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,090
ties into sovereignty so the eighty

93
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,610
Years War in the 30 Years War occupied

94
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,870
most of the 17th century along with all

95
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,770
the side Wars that surrounded them and

96
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,510
they're collectively some of the

97
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,920
bloodiest wars in European history

98
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,760
including modern works we think are

99
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,829
super bad like world war ii so in the 30

100
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,929
Years War alone more than eight million

101
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,370
people were killed and understand that

102
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,150
the population of Europe was a lot

103
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,350
closer to eight million than it was now

104
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,790
they were were there were several things

105
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,109
the right of religious

106
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,820
self-determination being a really

107
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,310
important one with both Protestants and

108
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,810
Catholics invading each other to protect

109
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,600
what they saw as the rights of their

110
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,730
religious adherents so Catholics were

111
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,410
invading Protestant countries to protect

112
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,119
the rights of ethnic Catholics in those

113
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,500
countries and if that seems like a

114
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,390
really familiar excuse to you you're

115
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,920
right it's also exactly the same excuse

116
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,899
to Vladimir Putin use when he wanted to

117
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,970
invade Crimea no I don't just want a

118
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,410
couple more deepwater ports it's really

119
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,239
important to me to protect the rights of

120
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,769
ethnic Russians in Crimea and if you

121
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,980
believe that I have this wonderful

122
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:13,080
bridge to sell you

123
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,670
because these wars and all these side

124
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,709
conflicts were so much of an everyone

125
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,930
vs. everyone war it took three separate

126
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,280
treaties to end them these three

127
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,989
treaties are collectively referred to as

128
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,359
the Peace of Westphalia and dated to

129
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,630
more or less 1685 but there's some new

130
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,730
on

131
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,469
on that and they they comprise the piece

132
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,380
of Muenster the Treaty of Munster and

133
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,580
the Treaty of on his Brooke generally

134
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,659
what happened under these treaties is

135
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,359
the Catholics and the Protestants split

136
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,710
into nations but where they didn't the

137
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,270
Catholics were required to protect the

138
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,210
rights of Protestants in Catholic

139
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,680
territories and vice versa so these

140
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,419
three treaties were remarkable in a few

141
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,340
different ways one was because they

142
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,320
weren't negotiated by Kings previously

143
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,359
treaties had been negotiated by Kings

144
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,950
standing on a bloody battlefield Sun

145
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,740
surrounded by the dismembered corpses of

146
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,080
their various armies instead for this

147
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,480
thunder-like that seemed a little tawdry

148
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,680
so instead let's appoint representatives

149
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,000
of the various sovereigns and we're

150
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,190
gonna send them to diplomatic

151
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,150
conferences at various cities across

152
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,320
Europe this process of negotiation and

153
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,909
the entire way in which it was

154
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,909
negotiated formed the basis of the

155
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,290
modern international diplomatic system

156
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,060
the other thing though most important

157
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,440
way for this talk is that they

158
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,110
recognized and incorporated a new

159
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,660
concept that all Kings were equally

160
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,090
kingly that is that they were equally

161
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,240
sovereign and so within their

162
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,469
territories a king had internal

163
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,930
sovereignty they could do whatever they

164
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,180
wanted within their territory outside of

165
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,310
their territory they weren't the king

166
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,660
full-stop as opposed to they weren't the

167
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,740
king until they raised a new army and

168
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,820
invade all your stuff which had

169
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,750
previously been the system under which

170
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,280
everyone in Europe lived so why does

171
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,290
this matter it matters because it

172
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,570
enables things like this exact photo to

173
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,650
take place if sovereigns are equally

174
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,260
sovereign that we can have diplomatic

175
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,390
relations between powers that respect

176
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,190
internal differences while recognizing

177
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,940
countries generalized equality on the

178
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,380
world stage

179
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,660
and that's true whether it's an enormous

180
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,460
rich country or a power backwater and

181
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,150
it's true when the formerly poor

182
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,460
backwater

183
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,289
becomes one of the richest countries in

184
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,400
the entire world and when the former

185
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,680
richest country in the entire world

186
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,450
decides to cut itself off from all of

187
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,010
its trading partners inexplicably in

188
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,840
order to make Britain great again and

189
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,460
then suffers a famine in six months

190
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,049
they're still like Queen Elizabeth is

191
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,099
still going to be a queen she's still

192
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,310
going to be the sovereign of the United

193
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Kingdom whatever is left of it

194
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,400
and this also leads to another thing

195
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,110
this is why countries can agree to give

196
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,690
up some of their sovereign Authority if

197
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,550
they want to so for instance almost

198
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,810
every Western country has signed a thing

199
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,270
called the United Nations Convention on

200
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,420
the Rights of the Child which prohibits

201
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,130
things like child soldiers some

202
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,510
countries the United States chief among

203
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,250
them have refused to sign this treaty

204
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,900
because we really love signing sixteen

205
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,200
year olds up to join the army we call it

206
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,120
JROTC all of Europe thinks this is

207
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,320
horrible and there's nothing they can do

208
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,730
about it because we're sovereign inside

209
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,890
the territories these sovereigns though

210
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,050
people when entities have to follow the

211
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,669
law of wherever they are so if you're

212
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,260
present in the kingdom of the plastics

213
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,330
and they mandate that on Wednesday we

214
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,680
wear pink then you have to wear pink on

215
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,599
Wednesdays when you're doing business in

216
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,710
their kingdom just how like now if you

217
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,570
do business in the United States you

218
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,159
have to follow us laws but you don't

219
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,260
have to follow say the laws of Khattar

220
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,510
unless you're doing business in Qatar

221
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:28,190
which seems obvious but it becomes

222
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,510
really important later so remember that

223
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,640
so that's what sovereignty is so now

224
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,980
let's talk about neutrality it's a real

225
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,510
simple addition because neutrality is

226
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,440
incredibly tied up with sovereignty your

227
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,080
travel needs a statement of just two

228
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,180
things one we are sovereign which means

229
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,580
we are fully separate from you for all

230
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,560
values of you so you have no authority

231
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,680
over us and secondly we're not going to

232
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,270
get involved with your crap it doesn't

233
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,220
make sense to say you're neutral unless

234
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,669
you're sovereign if you're not then your

235
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,470
allegiances are already written for you

236
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,090
so we're talking about tech sovereignty

237
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,460
and tech neutrality well is tech

238
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,650
sovereign well they just said no it's

239
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,810
not because there's no land of tech

240
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,570
utopia where only technology rules

241
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,790
despite the most insane ravings of Peter

242
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,200
Thiel and the sea stutters by the way

243
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,270
Peter Thiel in the sea stutters is my

244
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,349
Beach Boys cover band that only plays I

245
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:21,210
honor and inspired rewrites that said

246
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,100
it's not like tech is sovereign hasn't

247
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,599
ever been a topic of discussion John

248
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,830
Perry Barlow is one of the people who

249
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,590
claim to have founded the Electronic

250
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,990
Frontier Foundation said back in 1996

251
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,860
that tech was naturally independent of

252
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,870
all governments and they had no moral

253
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,330
two rules and you have no sovereignty

254
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:40,520
where we gather this was somewhat cheeky

255
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,690
it was also pretty ironic considering he

256
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,069
said it just a couple weeks after the

257
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,620
close of the World Economic Forum in

258
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,510
Davos and he said it in Davos it's hard

259
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,300
to see a larger gathering of sovereignty

260
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:53,450
and wealth and power than Davos but okay

261
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:56,120
cool you do you unfortunately that idea

262
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,350
didn't quite die 20 years later so now

263
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,940
in 2016

264
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,860
Brad Smith the general counsel and

265
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,140
president of Microsoft said the same

266
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,190
thing the tech and especially Microsoft

267
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,470
should think of itself as a digital

268
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,110
Switzerland where the largest companies

269
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,760
just off top my head Microsoft would be

270
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,040
immune from those pesky within our

271
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,720
borders laws and get to define what

272
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,640
countries processes they would comply

273
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,190
with even if the expense of their host

274
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,260
countries laws this is an interesting

275
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,060
thing to say Microsoft was trying to

276
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,640
sell this concept because they wanted to

277
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,739
hold themselves out as the lone staunch

278
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,960
defender of privacy rights what they

279
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,700
were saying was well you can trust

280
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,440
Microsoft to not comply with say

281
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,290
authoritarian Chinese demands for your

282
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,790
data because Microsoft is so big that we

283
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,660
shouldn't have to comply with Chinese

284
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,800
laws ok cool beans Brad but the problem

285
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:44,089
is you're also saying we should be

286
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,880
actually sovereign so we don't have to

287
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:49,160
comply with pesky US laws like minimum

288
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,470
wage laws or labor standards or OSHA or

289
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,170
whatever but let's focus on the

290
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,460
separation Microsoft's at the tech in

291
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,020
general and Mike are supposed to soft

292
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,970
specifically could and should be fully

293
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,590
separate from lost politics in society

294
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,020
so that it shouldn't get involved with

295
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,150
the concerns of mortal this proposal was

296
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,310
of course roundly mocked when Brad Smith

297
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,870
made it in 2016 and yet the future is

298
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,339
here apparently because last month

299
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,280
Microsoft appointed its own

300
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,080
representative to the United Nations

301
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,459
which should really scare you if it

302
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,910
doesn't it's just because you decided

303
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,560
the UN has failed and like I hope that's

304
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,660
not true even though the United Nations

305
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,510
does have a pesky problem where its host

306
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:29,390
country ie us breached the host country

307
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,810
treaty which is a little weird but okay

308
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:37,280
so Brad Smith thinks of himself as a un

309
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:39,349
statesman and on a broader no neutrality

310
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,870
require sovereignty as this persistent

311
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,660
recurring meme at both the kind of crazy

312
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,010
hippy level of the FF and the deeply and

313
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,469
terrifyingly powerful level of

314
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,180
Microsoft's

315
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,500
general counsel that text should be

316
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,729
neutral and therefore sovereign so what

317
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,310
like what's the harm really in

318
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,560
fulfilling Brad Smith boyhood fantasy of

319
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:02,729
getting the United Nations seat for a

320
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,930
giant paperclip with googly eyes well

321
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,030
let's go back to the mean we discussed

322
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,310
in the beginning the separateness to

323
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,439
neutrality of Technology this neutrality

324
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:13,770
means that Tech almost always considers

325
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,500
itself above politics the theory is that

326
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:18,620
tech occupies a perfect amoral space and

327
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,910
stop me if you've heard this one before

328
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,490
technology responds only to what is

329
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,650
possible and therefore the uses of

330
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:29,850
technology that seem that are not

331
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:32,220
technology's fault but societies and of

332
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,600
course since we respond only to what is

333
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,550
possible we're therefore the natural

334
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,840
kings and queens of civilization so we

335
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,750
should have everything including giant

336
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,310
slides run into the middle of our office

337
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,110
we can certainly see this idea in a

338
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,910
story from a month ago from NK jemisin

339
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,140
who's a fantastic science-fiction author

340
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,180
if you haven't read her books you should

341
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,180
so she was invited a couple months ago

342
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,250
to a big tech company to speak on one

343
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,770
condition that nothing she said made

344
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,130
anyone there uncomfortable and she

345
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,960
didn't talk about politics in any way

346
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,960
what an amazingly infantilizing

347
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,370
statement towards all the engineers and

348
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,720
people who work at whichever large tech

349
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,170
company this was I don't know which one

350
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,670
it is by its management these

351
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,050
technologists and their management are

352
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:15,089
demanding the world in all its

353
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,540
complexity use their technology but

354
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:20,340
they're so fragile about that demand

355
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,410
that we can't make them uncomfortable in

356
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,270
any way by pointing out say that their

357
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,250
technology has political implications

358
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,860
that might make them not enjoy the slide

359
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,210
as much and where would they be there

360
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,400
and I don't know which tech company it

361
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,450
was she didn't say and to be honest it

362
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,579
could have been any of the usual

363
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,110
suspects but this meme is really

364
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,120
pervasive and we can certainly see it in

365
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,830
this quote from Google's management so

366
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,330
Meredith Whittaker was the head of

367
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,000
artificial intelligence ethics for

368
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,680
Google and she went to Google and said

369
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,690
hey it seems really bad we're building a

370
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,550
massive persistent surveillance space

371
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,170
and then selling it to authoritarian

372
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,930
regimes and gules management said hey

373
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,599
don't worry about it technology is like

374
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,170
a hammer it can be used for good things

375
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,510
or for

376
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,339
and things and as she went on to point

377
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,510
out that's true

378
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:04,769
but maybe we should start asking

379
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,480
questions about the political

380
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:07,889
implications of selling hammers the

381
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,529
government Department of hitting people

382
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:12,029
with hammers or I'm sorry that was

383
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:13,410
unfair I should really use their full

384
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,880
legal formal name the government

385
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,439
Department of locking minorities and

386
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,639
cages and then hitting them with hammers

387
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,250
to make America great again so some

388
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,750
companies are directly abating human

389
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,329
directly aiding human rights abuses by

390
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,620
choosing where to sell their software

391
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:30,719
but I think there's a lot of harm being

392
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,370
caused by more self-consciously neutral

393
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,699
actions the ones who really honestly

394
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:37,230
believe were not taken aside so I'm

395
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:38,459
gonna use github as an example of this

396
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,050
next issue because this came up a couple

397
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,010
months ago with regard to github but I

398
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,920
want to be clear that this is just

399
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:45,540
realist reach and github isn't alone in

400
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,810
taking this self-consciously neutral

401
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,250
approach so many technology companies

402
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,829
get up among them will comply with any

403
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:55,350
valid court order issued in any country

404
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:57,239
not just United States ones because they

405
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,019
feel they should be neutral now most of

406
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,399
the time these companies are not

407
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,540
actually bound to follow court orders

408
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,430
from other companies because they're not

409
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,870
present in the country github is a

410
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,219
slightly weird case on this because of

411
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,630
Microsoft and there's a lot of questions

412
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,490
as to how separate github really is from

413
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,290
Microsoft but they've had this policy

414
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,089
for years and Microsoft only owned them

415
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,969
for like 14 months so let's set that

416
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:16,769
issue aside for now so there was an

417
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,690
encrypted messaging app called tsunami

418
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:20,449
Democratic in the fall which was set up

419
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,920
to help protesters in Barcelona

420
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:24,630
organized coordinated protests against

421
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,949
the Spanish government the reason they

422
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,630
were protesting is because the Spanish

423
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,910
government literally locked up all the

424
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,439
leaders of a political movement all of

425
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,550
them because they didn't like them so

426
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,790
they charged some old terrorism and

427
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,380
threw them all in jail so there was this

428
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,689
website and there was this app and a

429
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,490
Spanish Court instantly ruled you have

430
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:44,190
to take down this website and you have

431
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,480
to take down this app Google immediately

432
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,220
took the app off of the Google Play

433
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,190
Store but tsunami Democratic was like

434
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,839
that's okay we're young youthful tech

435
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,449
protest movement we can teach people how

436
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,569
to sideload apps and you can download it

437
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:59,430
off of github so a court-ordered github

438
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:00,959
to take down the app and github

439
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,979
immediately complied even though again

440
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,300
they're not in Spain because that was

441
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,110
their stated policy and because they

442
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,599
don't believe that they're in a position

443
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,670
to be able to decide among differing

444
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,830
places we should be neutral which would

445
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,250
be

446
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:17,110
the politics and to be clear github does

447
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,520
one very right thing by publishing

448
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,750
government order to take down to the

449
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,640
public get repository you could

450
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,990
literally see both of the orders that

451
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,850
you have received on this issue it's at

452
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,040
github calm slash github uh slash gov

453
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,590
takedown and slash twenty-nine Tre slash

454
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,140
Spain slash 2019 it's a new country then

455
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:33,850
date so that's super cool

456
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,590
and I don't want to make you think this

457
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,970
is just about yet hub though I kind of

458
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,670
obviously disagree with this decision of

459
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,220
github and to recap remember companies

460
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:44,709
in Spain have to comply with the laws of

461
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,090
Spain now I might prefer that they take

462
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,040
the civilly disobedient action of

463
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,020
ignoring a clearly illegal court order

464
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,579
to suppress a democratic protest but

465
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,930
today's talk is not on the duty of civil

466
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,160
disobedience in response to an

467
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,530
authoritarian government that's a

468
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,020
different talk but company's not in

469
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:01,329
Spain get to laugh and ignore clearly

470
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,740
illegal court orders like this so this

471
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,240
behavior on the part of most tech

472
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,450
companies and most tech companies do

473
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,700
this and most tech companies are US for

474
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,260
now at least is entirely voluntary

475
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,730
they're volunteering to help suppress

476
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,800
protest movements under the guise of

477
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,990
neutrality they're volunteering to help

478
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,020
take down controversial content less

479
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:22,480
they upset the Chinese government and so

480
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,310
on so the companies that really

481
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,020
fundamentally believe in this neutrality

482
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,300
and a lot of companies do it's not just

483
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,949
business experience this is a sad

484
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,599
problem they might even write a tweet

485
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,370
about how they hope that the Democratic

486
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,350
situation in Spain will improve itself

487
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,120
without any intervention on their part

488
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:38,830
of course but apparently it's more

489
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,840
important to them to be separate from

490
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,670
real people's concerns and we hear this

491
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,140
kind of response continuously from tech

492
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,420
company is confronted with ethical

493
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,520
concerns over how their tech is being

494
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,260
used from any vision scraping every

495
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,819
photo on the web or every photo that's

496
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,050
ever been uploaded to the entire web so

497
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,910
they can make a massive facial

498
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,680
surveillance database and then sell it

499
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,230
for pennies to random cops without

500
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,079
informing them of like the accuracy rate

501
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:04,089
of it which seems you know weird to NSO

502
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,069
and dark-matter who openly sell attack

503
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:08,500
tooling to repressive governments to use

504
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:10,030
against their local activists the geo

505
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,880
group who just profits from internment

506
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:15,609
hey if you don't like internment of a

507
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,530
minority group it's society's problem if

508
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,849
you want to change our behavior we're

509
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,629
just following the laws you've got to

510
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:23,859
change society it's never our problem of

511
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,329
course there are also companies that

512
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:27,490
move beyond simple

513
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,470
apathy or pseudo apathy towards direct

514
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,630
harm so we have companies like Palantir

515
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,200
in uber who already ignore laws in every

516
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,120
country

517
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,679
uber quite famously has a big red button

518
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,879
that enables you to destroy all the

519
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,970
evidence as the cops show up in any

520
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,799
foreign country and Palantir of course

521
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,330
who in addition to their CEO having said

522
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,789
a lot of really concerning things about

523
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:47,559
Western supremacy on video interviews in

524
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:49,059
the last couple years also named

525
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,710
themselves after a fictional mass

526
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:52,570
surveillance system without noticing

527
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,340
that in the books the system

528
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,570
irredeemably corrupted the souls of

529
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,590
everyone who ever touched the mass

530
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,330
surveillance system

531
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,760
I felt like Palantir should be be read a

532
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,949
book all the way to the end sometime I

533
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,460
might suggest that they start with IBM

534
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:08,049
and the Holocaust but that to me so to

535
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,269
sum up this is the behavior of the tech

536
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:11,529
industry as stated okay not stated this

537
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:13,090
is a completely made-up quote but it's a

538
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:15,460
great song and you all listen to it by

539
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,529
Tom Lehrer once the Rockets go up who

540
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,500
cares where they come down that's not my

541
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:22,059
department says vandervon broad but I

542
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,590
will state that this is not acceptable

543
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,110
behavior for those of us who work in

544
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:28,899
security because we have to care where

545
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,010
the effects of our actions land so we've

546
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,750
talked about the meme of neutrality

547
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,669
intact we've talked about why it's both

548
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:38,380
miss founded and worst causes quite a

549
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:39,850
lot of harm so what do we do I only give

550
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,580
you part of the NK jemisin the story

551
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,529
before so here's the key bit she said

552
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,949
there aren't politically neutral spaces

553
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:49,419
people are involved with technology so

554
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,049
technology spaces are inherently

555
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:54,460
political and I would add to this that

556
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,139
again pretending there are these

557
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,929
politically neutral spaces because we're

558
00:18:56,139 --> 00:19:01,000
above the fray directly infantilizes us

559
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:03,100
as technologists and harms us as members

560
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,529
of a civilization that really needs to

561
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,449
spend some solid time coming to grips

562
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:11,019
with what we've done what we're still

563
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,639
doing and what we plan to do next so how

564
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,779
many of you by a quick show of hands in

565
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:15,789
this theater can actually see some of

566
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:17,049
you have heard the phrase it's more

567
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:19,000
important to have a seat at the table

568
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:20,350
when your company is just a fine doing

569
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,149
something you disagreed with anybody

570
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,899
yeah

571
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:24,158
forty percent of the people in this

572
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:27,399
audience which is maybe a little

573
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,960
self-selected let's be honest so this

574
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:31,239
often comes out is well we don't agree

575
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,799
with all the government or enormous

576
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,600
corporation or whatever's actions or

577
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,490
policies but we believe that by having a

578
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,240
seat at the table we'll be able to

579
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:43,540
effect change from within

580
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,560
so okay seems fine on face but pinboard

581
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,300
who's wonderful they should follow him

582
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,669
on Twitter play method the quiet push

583
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,520
from change from within is never-ending

584
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,140
an insufficient the problem is the

585
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,910
people who say this kind of thing always

586
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,560
want to protect that seat at the table

587
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,900
as it lets them be with the cool kids

588
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,760
they never want to actually take the

589
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,710
stand but they never really make a red

590
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,140
line where they're saying this far and

591
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,970
no farther so instead they continue to

592
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,150
enable enable the behavior and never

593
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,680
change it Eva galperin who is chief

594
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,850
security officer and chief a bunch of

595
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,470
other things I can ever remember but

596
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:17,230
anyway huge badass Electronic Frontier

597
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,060
Foundation delivered this quote the

598
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,890
choices you make in your job matter if

599
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,510
you're a technologist and she was

600
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,980
talking about engineers in an electronic

601
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,340
medical record system called practice

602
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,840
Fusion who designed opioid pushing into

603
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,959
the electronic medical record so every

604
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,209
time you doctor entered something that

605
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,440
might cause pain like a broken bone into

606
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,360
the EMR would say hey maybe you should

607
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,410
prescribe them opioids and the reason

608
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,870
they did that is because this feature

609
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:43,900
had been paid for its implementation by

610
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:45,550
a major opioid manufacturer so then lots

611
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,960
more people got addicted to opioids when

612
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,850
they got cut off lots more people got

613
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,150
addicted to heroin and that has certain

614
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,919
negative consequences Joe Redman is a

615
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,750
famous computer vision researcher and he

616
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,640
designed the Yolo or you only look to

617
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,440
computer vision algorithm which made a

618
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,180
lot of mobile facial recognition faster

619
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,560
and cooler and he became real world

620
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,020
famous enough to get his own full

621
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,280
conference TED talk and then nerd famous

622
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,990
enough to get Google to pay for an

623
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,860
entire PhD for him to study computer

624
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,780
vision at the University of Washington

625
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,370
which as of a few days ago he's

626
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,710
announced he's stopping forever

627
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,060
because he's like it's all military

628
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,620
applications there are no good

629
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,780
applications of facial recognition and

630
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,689
computer vision left it's only harmful

631
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,149
ones and he specifically thinks it's

632
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,920
impossible to say you shouldn't look at

633
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,180
the broader societal impact which was

634
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,630
the debate this was having on the

635
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,980
internet I said before they don't like I

636
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,420
fight for the users of statement for

637
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,280
security professionals this is what I

638
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,930
prefer the whole that's not my

639
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,370
department idea isn't acceptable because

640
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,470
our role is security is to be the

641
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,820
guardians of trust we're not just

642
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,190
hammers and our work isn't just

643
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,020
hammering things we're the sword that

644
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,640
protects the world and our goal is to

645
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,500
make the world suck a little bit less

646
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,480
every day not to enable harm to our you

647
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,340
they put their trust in us and indeed

648
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,740
we're all users of these same

649
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,530
technologies so we as a community put

650
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,320
our trust in ourselves we fight as the

651
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:06,520
users and but we also have a larger goal

652
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,740
and a larger role of protecting everyone

653
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,730
so everyone in this room has the power

654
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,160
it's the stunningly talented

655
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,900
technologists you are to do better to

656
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,940
care and to engage honestly with the

657
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,500
work you personally are doing and then

658
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,160
to make these decisions based on giving

659
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,650
a damn

660
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,870
even as the meme says a tiny potato can

661
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:26,120
make a Gordon change so here's my call

662
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,830
to action and it's very simple I want

663
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,418
you all to figure out what the effects

664
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,120
of technology that you're building are

665
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:35,630
and then decide are you okay with those

666
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,129
effects or not if you're not I want you

667
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,010
to change the effects change the

668
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,830
technology or even can simply refuse to

669
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:45,049
continue working on it but please stop

670
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:47,210
pretending you're above whatever the

671
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:48,830
effect of your technology are I want you

672
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,419
to engage with your work as though it

673
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,340
has moral implications because it does

674
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:54,559
and then I want you to decide if you are

675
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,149
morally okay with what you're doing now

676
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,500
I have certain political leanings you

677
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,090
may have been able to come across in

678
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,440
this talk but if you don't come out

679
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,928
where I stand on these issues that's

680
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,580
okay too the important thing is that you

681
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:06,740
recognize that there are moral

682
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,600
implications to our choices and then our

683
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,730
security professionals our highest duty

684
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,969
is to protect the trust that users place

685
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,440
in technology and look it's hard a

686
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,820
politics is hard worrying about

687
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,530
implications is very very hard and

688
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,120
requires a lot of talking which is scary

689
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,678
and talking to people which isn't we're

690
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,379
not exactly like us which is even

691
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,510
scarier and change is slow and not

692
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,850
inevitable I some days I have to admit I

693
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:31,760
wish that Barlow stream or Brad Smith's

694
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,530
adolescent fantasy were workable I wish

695
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,720
that we could all focus on simply the

696
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,610
beauty of the baud and all the things

697
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,020
we've studied and practiced for years to

698
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:42,199
just hone our craft as security

699
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,260
professionals but it's not possible to

700
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,429
do that and it's not right to do that

701
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,620
the truth of the matter is the

702
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:51,320
technology is not separate from society

703
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,570
is an essential component of the fabric

704
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,850
of society now more than ever before and

705
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,520
when we make technology decisions as

706
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,080
though we're somehow above politics we

707
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,820
reinforce power at the expense of

708
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,710
justice we enable surveillance

709
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,970
radicalization destructive

710
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,850
misinformation and the Poli

711
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,230
a part of our hard-won civilization it

712
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,719
is critical that as security

713
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,850
professionals in particular we stop

714
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,789
defending what tears of the fabric of

715
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:19,129
our society and we move to defend what

716
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:21,770
we can justify to ourselves if no one

717
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:24,380
else as work that causes an actual good

718
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,418
to happen in the world we're all in this

719
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:37,070
together and it's well past time we

720
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:38,480
started acting like it thank you I don't

721
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,950
know if we have time for slide out

722
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,990
questions I'm kind of guessing we don't

723
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,760
but you couldn't again all hit me up on

724
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,669
Twitter at USS join maybe we have a

725
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:51,860
slight a question what were they no

726
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:53,600
slight up like thumbs yeah we have time

727
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,789
for probably maybe one slide Oh question

728
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,860
if anyone's got one the room again is

729
00:24:55,789 --> 00:25:09,950
besides SF or you can just yell it out

730
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:11,000
just yell if there's not on the line so

731
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,559
the question was what is the role of

732
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,940
collective action in deciding what you

733
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,658
work on and having a broader impact I

734
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,409
think that's it's very important I

735
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:20,630
personally would love to see more tech

736
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:23,840
unions because I am that kind of a nerd

737
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,490
I think the collective action thing is

738
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,199
another step beyond this and so I'm

739
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,760
emphasizing trying to take the first

740
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,890
step of just believing you have ethical

741
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,658
choices but yeah I absolutely believe

742
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,640
that recognizing that we have collective

743
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:36,500
power as well as individual power is

744
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,799
important to making sure that what we

745
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,700
work on is valid and defensible as well

746
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,039
as making sure that our colleagues

747
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,650
aren't viciously exploited see also

748
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,000
every article about the horrors that

749
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:53,169
Facebook and Google reviewers have to

750
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,169
deal with awesome thanks a lot Brendon
