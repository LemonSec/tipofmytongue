1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
all right we're just about to get

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,580
started with Alan Friedman's talk I'm

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,500
going to introduce him one minute early

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,000
so he gets the full time he's the

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,500
director of cybersecurity at the

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,269
National Telecommunications and

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,910
Information Administration in the US

8
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,340
Department of Commerce he coordinates

9
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,900
NTIA x' work on cybersecurity focusing

10
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,890
on building communities of passionate

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,070
experts to address vulnerabilities

12
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,900
across the software world he's going to

13
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,310
give his talk you can submit questions

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,598
to the SLI dot do and he will moderate

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,230
those and answer those at the end of his

16
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:38,040
talk Thanks thank you so much thank you

17
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,809
everyone for joining us I'm a failed

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,239
professor who got suckered into joining

19
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,559
government about five years ago over the

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,160
last five years we've tried to tackle

21
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,589
some of the fun and sticky issues in

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,319
InfoSec where the government doesn't say

23
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,930
we want this as a solution but there is

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,399
a clear interest in having a solution

25
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,680
out there and so we've tried to do is

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,420
bring together the experts in the world

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,210
who know about this stuff to say what

28
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,040
will actually work for us so security is

29
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,710
about unpredictability you're having a

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,450
fine one afternoon and then all of a

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,830
sudden Katz comes up to you no he

32
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,020
doesn't say your basic blond dose he

33
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,880
says we've discovered a new

34
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,759
vulnerability right this happens all the

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,110
time and sometimes it's in the top level

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,790
software that you know about that's in

37
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,789
your vulnerability management system but

38
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,740
more often than not it is going to be in

39
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,210
a component that's gonna be a little

40
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,000
under the water level it's gonna be used

41
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,329
as a third party approach so do you have

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,890
a chance to survive can you make your

43
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:40,919
time I would argue that today there are

44
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,280
very few organizations that can quickly

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,770
and easily answer this question that can

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,909
actually say when they learn about a new

47
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,350
vulnerability in an open-source library

48
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,610
whether you make software or use

49
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,890
software there are very few

50
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,689
organizations that can say we are

51
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,210
affected or we're not affected and if we

52
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,389
are affected here's what we can do and

53
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:06,689
so our vision here is to actually tell

54
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,959
the story about how transparency can

55
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,640
drive that resiliency that ability to

56
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,670
say when we learn about these new risks

57
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,540
we can adapt and respond properly

58
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:20,869
so um transparency in the marketplace is

59
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:24,019
not a new issue right we are used to a

60
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,360
world with lists of ingredients and it's

61
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:30,050
kind of crazy that we know more about

62
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,420
what's in say a box of Twinkies then we

63
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:35,959
do about what's in the software that's

64
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,910
running our entire world and even by the

65
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,769
way that's important

66
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:44,200
fun fact those who didn't know this

67
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:47,030
Twinkies not actually vegetarian now

68
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:52,268
what's really important to remember is

69
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,410
most of the time some of us may not care

70
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:56,870
until there's someone in your life

71
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:00,200
that's got a food sensitivity that has a

72
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,760
religious restriction that has a way of

73
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,579
life and then it's very important that

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,798
that data is available and accessible in

75
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,269
a way that you can use it and that's the

76
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,420
vision of transparency it's not about

77
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:14,989
forcing particular behavior it's about

78
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,970
empowering good risk based decisions

79
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:19,850
based on your own needs and this isn't

80
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,440
unique to the consumer space right so if

81
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,840
you are in the chemical world there's

82
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,180
something called a Safety Data Sheet you

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,190
run a factory you get a palette of 50

84
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,260
gallon drums each of those is gonna come

85
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,120
with a safety data sheet it's an ISO

86
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,220
standard that says this is what's in the

87
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,799
barrel and this is what you do when it

88
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,180
up ends all over Frank so that you know

89
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,989
what to do with Frank when he's covered

90
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,690
in the chemicals and even the term Bill

91
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:46,489
of Materials comes from industry it's a

92
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,720
very old term from the software supply

93
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,350
chain er from the supply chain world

94
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,540
which says if you go and buy a 10 ton

95
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,130
diesel generator for your facility today

96
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,540
right that's resiliency that's making

97
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,109
sure you know what to do when the power

98
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,660
goes out it will come with a bill of

99
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:05,030
materials here's a list of every nut in

100
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,410
every bolt so that you know what the

101
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,480
total cost of ownership is so that you

102
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,639
can do maintenance on it but today if

103
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,970
you buy it it's going to be connected to

104
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:15,739
the Internet and I would argue that

105
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,139
unfortunately today you have no idea

106
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,298
whether that IP stack is made of the

107
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:21,978
freshest healthiest ingredients or it's

108
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:24,770
gonna do things that are damaging to you

109
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:26,659
and yours so what why should we think

110
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,400
about this for software well because I

111
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:29,979
would argue for soft

112
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,270
we're knowing what's under the hood is

113
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:36,460
even more important and it's more opaque

114
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:40,270
so here's a great project that a woman

115
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:43,659
named a Saco son at NTT has done where

116
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,030
she sort of said hey we have a single

117
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,270
VAT manufacturer it's rebranded by a

118
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,710
bunch of white box vendors how do you

119
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,440
know what the firmware what the

120
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,820
vulnerabilities in your IP camera are

121
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,900
and these are not these aren't the cheap

122
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,229
ones these are the commercial grade

123
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,690
cameras so this is you buy it comes from

124
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:03,300
vendor you have to use a project like

125
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:06,100
this before you can even find out

126
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,229
whether there's a vulnerability hint

127
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,530
there are several very real

128
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:13,750
vulnerabilities in this exact camera one

129
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,010
of which in fact was a key driver behind

130
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,550
the mirror I bought in that attack that

131
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:20,949
took down dime but of course software

132
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,560
doesn't just run cameras doesn't just

133
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:25,900
run organizations it runs large pieces

134
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,930
of equipment and go boom and it runs

135
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,989
small pieces of software that are about

136
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,870
as important as that can be literally a

137
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:37,449
matter of life and death so as we think

138
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,669
about understanding the software supply

139
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,949
chain it's important to remember that we

140
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:46,359
can wear different hats I like to wear

141
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:49,060
hats and it can really transparency can

142
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,300
drive real benefits based on if you make

143
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,830
software you choose software or your

144
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,080
operating software so if you're making

145
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:59,050
software again first of all you've got

146
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,210
to know what your ship this is something

147
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,610
that surprisingly few organizations were

148
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,770
doing even just a few years ago more of

149
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,520
us are now aware of it

150
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,049
but it's something that we're still

151
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,240
trying to learn how to do better of

152
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,310
monitoring for vulnerabilities but even

153
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
just you look at what's under the hood

154
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,240
in some of these large products there

155
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,810
are some vendors that will ship a large

156
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,500
product with four five six seven I've

157
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,050
heard nine versions of the same piece of

158
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,270
software inside one blinking box that's

159
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,949
used in critical infrastructure so it's

160
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,109
not just about security we can tell a

161
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:34,330
story about quality as well now if

162
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,830
you're buying software seems to me that

163
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,229
a very important question to ask is hey

164
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,449
are you selling me something that out of

165
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,378
the

166
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:44,029
box will put me in my network at risk so

167
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,860
this is something where we're going for

168
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:48,039
where we're trying to say here are some

169
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,379
of the questions that we can ask today

170
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:54,020
or alternatively you can say hey your

171
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:55,699
user giving me some software what do I

172
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,680
know about it what don't I know about it

173
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:00,379
so that I can do a more secure a more

174
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,909
targeted security analysis and then

175
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:04,370
finally of course operating software

176
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:06,949
I've got something on my network a new

177
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,020
vulnerabilities announced am i affected

178
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,210
is one of those core questions that we

179
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,969
need to ask ourselves but almost as

180
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:17,330
important is that last bullet which is

181
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:21,560
if I'm affected and I'm waiting around

182
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:23,300
for my vendor to respond if I know that

183
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,319
I'm potentially at risk I can take

184
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,270
risk-based decisions of my own I can

185
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,149
tune my IDs I can segment my network I

186
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,849
can take decisions that I think are the

187
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:36,469
right level of precaution based on the

188
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:38,688
software in question my network what's

189
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:41,210
supposed etc etc so why aren't we doing

190
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:43,370
this already right it sounds like a

191
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,830
pretty good idea we do it in other areas

192
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:50,899
why aren't we doing it already well one

193
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:53,779
answer is those pesky lawyers software

194
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:55,610
licensing is a challenge until a few

195
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:57,469
years ago I don't know how many of even

196
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:02,539
the biggest companies in the world could

197
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:04,490
honestly say that we know we've got all

198
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:06,110
of our licenses sorted and we're not

199
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,620
shipping any GPL products or anything

200
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,439
like that

201
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,979
I think that in 2020 that's a much

202
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:14,839
better understood risk there are more

203
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,580
and more tools on the market that can do

204
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,469
this kind of analysis for you turnkey

205
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,628
this is something that lawyers are aware

206
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:24,229
of this is something that we have a

207
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:26,149
better handle on today another reason is

208
00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:28,909
that it turns out it's actually a little

209
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:31,789
bit hard because for this to work for

210
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:34,429
this to scale we have to have a shared

211
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:37,098
vision across the entire ecosystem and

212
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:39,109
we don't have that or didn't have that

213
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,149
until recently and we didn't have it

214
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,899
because it was a little bit of a chicken

215
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:46,490
and egg problem right no one was asking

216
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,410
for this information so no one was

217
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,029
providing it no one was providing it

218
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,279
soon known was asking for it so there

219
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,410
were no tools to use it now

220
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:57,550
that is what we economists like to call

221
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:59,839
a market failure and market failures

222
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,089
mean that your friends the government

223
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,199
get to get involved right who doesn't

224
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:05,839
love it when the government just shows

225
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:11,779
up now how does the government

226
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:14,329
traditionally solve problems well we can

227
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,480
either pay you to do things or beat you

228
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:20,089
until you do it well and unfortunately

229
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,559
no one gave me a budget or staff so I

230
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:24,699
can't pay anyone to do anything

231
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:28,009
and either unfortunately or fortunately

232
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:31,609
Congress did not see fit to empower me

233
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:34,930
to do jack so I can't tell anyone

234
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:39,589
to do anything in any meaningful way so

235
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:42,559
the solution that we have is we bring a

236
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:45,860
bunch of people together and I say all

237
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:50,449
go away if you all solve this problem

238
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:53,809
and our vision here is act has been

239
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:57,649
pretty ambitious because for this to

240
00:09:53,809 --> 00:10:00,740
work it has to apply across every vector

241
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:02,689
if we go and say here's a solution for

242
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,670
the people who buy and build for DoD

243
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:07,069
land and here's another solution for

244
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,599
this regulated sector and Finance is

245
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:10,910
going to go off and do it one way well

246
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,339
that won't work because that won't scale

247
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:17,329
and it means we won't get the benefits

248
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:19,730
of tooling and mass adoption and we also

249
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:22,339
have to look at the entire software

250
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,100
lifecycle open source middleware

251
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,569
commercial software embedded systems and

252
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,309
perhaps most importantly the end

253
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:30,559
customer so we're trying to make sure

254
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:32,600
this is market driven we want all those

255
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:33,829
perspectives at the table so we have

256
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,540
this lovely thing that we call the

257
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:37,309
multi-stakeholder process at NTIA

258
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,319
and if you roll your eyes at the term

259
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:40,699
multi-stakeholder process on the guy

260
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:42,800
who's to say it like eight times a day

261
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:45,349
but it's the term that we're saddled

262
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,029
with and so what we've done is we've

263
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,550
tried to bring folks together just very

264
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:50,990
quickly to assure any skeptics or people

265
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,550
who are afraid what are we not doing

266
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,959
it's not regulation

267
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,699
again we're not empowered to do anything

268
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,800
although I'll touch back on regulation a

269
00:10:55,699 --> 00:11:00,258
little bit later it's not source code

270
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,399
disclosure it's not standards

271
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,290
development we're not a standards

272
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,879
development process and we're not trying

273
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,839
to solve everything in supply chain

274
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,640
supply

275
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,710
the biggest big enough buzz word that

276
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,540
you too can have your own federal

277
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,370
government process based on whatever you

278
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,439
want to do we're not trying to solve

279
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:18,620
everything we're looking at this one key

280
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,200
area which is the thin narrow level of

281
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,360
software transparency in a way that is

282
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,730
lightweight and is meant to scale for

283
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,220
all software we've been doing this for a

284
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,360
little over a year I'm very pleased to

285
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,610
see that a few of you in the audience

286
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,070
lying I can't actually see anyone in the

287
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,540
audience right now but some of you in

288
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,820
the audience have been participating and

289
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,110
I think we've made a lot of progress

290
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,200
what have we done we have a shared

291
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:45,380
vision of the scope of the problem we've

292
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,180
developed some baseline definitions an

293
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,950
emphasis on the fact that it's got to be

294
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,979
automated it's got to have this broad

295
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:54,140
scope and on this handy-dandy website

296
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,630
which is also going to be on some of

297
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,890
these stickers that we'll give out you

298
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,380
can see some of these resources we've

299
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:03,080
sort of defined what is the nest bomb

300
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,330
why we should ask them how do we ask

301
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,070
bomb and then can we ask bomb today and

302
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,410
we're still working on now the next step

303
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,700
so very briefly Allen you've been

304
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,209
talking about a nest bomb for a long

305
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,810
time what the heck is it well here's a

306
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:21,880
toy example of what it can look like

307
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:24,949
I've got my Acme appliance and it uses

308
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:28,010
two software components uses exactly two

309
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:30,080
we know what they are and in turn Bob's

310
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:33,050
browser we know uses carols compression

311
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,610
engine carols compression engine we know

312
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,260
so the other thing in addition to having

313
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,000
a tree here so we know what the

314
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,280
relationships are which can go as deep

315
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,310
as we want the other thing we're

316
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:45,860
capturing is known unknowns so that when

317
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,449
you look at this you have some idea of

318
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,010
the completeness of information so we

319
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,190
know that Acme appliance has exactly two

320
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,930
dependencies we have no idea whether

321
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,880
bingo buffer has any dependencies or not

322
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,709
we know that carols compression engine

323
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,089
has no dependencies it's a root in our

324
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:01,310
tree or a leaf on our tree depending on

325
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:04,040
which way you draw your treat believe it

326
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,199
or not it took many weeks to figure out

327
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,480
which way we should draw our tree to put

328
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,060
the root at the top or the bottom turns

329
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,740
out as long as you need one way to do it

330
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:17,150
standards are hard who knew so and we

331
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,620
know that Bob's browser includes at

332
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,220
least carols compression engine it may

333
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,920
include

334
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,959
more so you can look at this and get

335
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,620
some idea not just what you have on your

336
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,138
network

337
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,360
but if you really need to know what's on

338
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,589
your network you now know where to do

339
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,319
further research or where to start

340
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:35,720
asking questions so now each of those

341
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:38,329
when I say here are the components what

342
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,730
do we mean by a component I want to be

343
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:42,739
able to sufficiently uniquely identify

344
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,350
each component so what's the supplier

345
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,850
what's the component name what version

346
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,980
is it right now I need to know whether

347
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,379
it's up-to-date and then by the way give

348
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,060
me the hash so that I can verify that

349
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:55,670
you and I are talking about the same one

350
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,800
I want to make sure that you didn't just

351
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,800
go download some cloned backdoored copy

352
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,689
on github so we've got our tree we've

353
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,410
got our components how many levels deep

354
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:08,480
to this tree go Alan as deep as possible

355
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,399
we want as much information as we can

356
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,829
but we also acknowledge that it's going

357
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,870
to be hard to do at the beginning and so

358
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,969
the minimum viable approach is you need

359
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,620
to have at all of your top level

360
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,660
includes tell me what they are and again

361
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,579
I say includes we're talking about third

362
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,290
party code not the code that you write

363
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:28,609
but what are the components that you're

364
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:31,459
bringing on board and then ideally in a

365
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:34,790
magical world if everyone does that we

366
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:37,758
will recurse our way all the way up the

367
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:39,980
supply chain and by the way if we're in

368
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,870
an open source world then if someone

369
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,839
really cares they can take on a lot of

370
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,160
that ownership themselves so I've talked

371
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,949
a little bit about the benefits but I

372
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,439
want to flag to more systemic benefits

373
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:54,170
that sort of capture some of the public

374
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:56,360
policy interest here one is just

375
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:01,370
thinking about how having this kind of

376
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,319
transparency will help us when we do

377
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,589
discover something that's far up the

378
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:09,680
supply chain so at the top here we have

379
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:11,990
a traditional case of timed or mediation

380
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,329
once we find a flaw which is I find a

381
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,370
flaw we managed to convince the

382
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:18,378
maintainer zuv that open source project

383
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,240
and so they go and fix it takes them

384
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:22,670
some time and then they put that patch

385
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,870
out so the people who are using it say

386
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,599
oh look there's a new version of this

387
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:30,259
let's try to integrate that so it's got

388
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,670
a cascade all the way down in what we

389
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:33,230
might use the analogy here is a

390
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,640
waterfall

391
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,140
that waterfall is the best way to

392
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,860
develop software right this is the

393
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:43,210
analogy that we still love to run with

394
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:45,650
so in a world where we have transparency

395
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,010
the software doesn't magically fix

396
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,959
itself I don't want to overstate it but

397
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:53,090
while you're waiting for that

398
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,840
improvement for the fix to slowly

399
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:59,420
percolate down you can be prepared you

400
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:02,360
can make a decision again based on your

401
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,930
risk and your needs to say we're going

402
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,030
to put in something in line that will at

403
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,819
least make us more comfortable thinking

404
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:13,280
about our risks this so the other thing

405
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,340
that I like is this is a real potential

406
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,610
to have some changes in the open-source

407
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:22,760
ecosystem itself where we can start to

408
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:26,000
create some market driven pressure from

409
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,920
downstream users to say hey let's think

410
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,630
about what open source libraries we

411
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,490
should use and I don't want to pick on

412
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,600
open source commercial is the same way

413
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:38,120
which ones we want to use because now I

414
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,310
know that my downstream customers and

415
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,840
their customers have a chance to look at

416
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,510
me and ask why certain decisions were

417
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,980
made so a couple of great stories here

418
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,470
I'm sure some of you heard the story of

419
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,960
you have a choice between two projects

420
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,850
one has never had any security issues

421
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,980
whatsoever reported they've got no CDs

422
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,840
the other in the last year had two

423
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:02,290
public CVEs reported against them

424
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:05,549
which one do you pick it depends as

425
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:08,379
right answer but I would argue that

426
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:10,720
having a CV against a software project

427
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,220
is actually a good sign it means that

428
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,270
they are aware of security issues

429
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,459
they're willing to fix them they know

430
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,410
how to fix them and they're aware that

431
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:19,780
fixing security issues involves a

432
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:23,500
broader ecosystem initiative than just

433
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:25,089
fixing their own code so I'm not going

434
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,799
to delve too strongly to how do we do it

435
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:29,290
I can just say that we've gotten pretty

436
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,120
close to solving this approach we didn't

437
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,250
want to invent a new standard the good

438
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,189
news was at least one technical standard

439
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,740
out there said hey we can capture s bomb

440
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:41,260
data the bad news is that more than one

441
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:44,559
technical standard out there said hey we

442
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,270
can capture s bomb data so our vision

443
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,120
was to make sure that we can reconcile

444
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,160
these two s P DX comes out a Linux

445
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,790
Foundation it's a way of capturing

446
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:57,370
open-source data it was built to address

447
00:17:53,790 --> 00:18:00,280
licensing issues but we can use it for

448
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:02,250
our interest in security swig or

449
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,690
software ID tags is an ISO standard

450
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,070
that's great news if you work for a

451
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,200
company that wants to trade around the

452
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,790
world it's a little frustrating if you

453
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,830
want to actually read the spec yourself

454
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:14,830
and you don't have 390 Swiss francs

455
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:18,580
handy but the good news is you can go

456
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:20,799
online and look at mr. 80/60 which sort

457
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,299
of details here's some of the spec years

458
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,908
what are the fields that we should care

459
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:27,370
about behind swig tags and again our

460
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:29,830
vision here has been to make sure that

461
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,600
we can have bilingual translation and in

462
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,639
fact there's a third standard called

463
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,010
cyclone DX that's being developed in 200

464
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,470
ASP specifically for the online

465
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:41,590
application needs

466
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:43,030
so we also in the past year there was a

467
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,100
proof-of-concept from the healthcare

468
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,260
sector remember I said we're not

469
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,530
regulatory I don't have any power but

470
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,790
we've got friends with power and the

471
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,470
Food and Drug Administration which

472
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,110
regulates medical devices has publicly

473
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,640
said we're going to require every new

474
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,780
medical device that wants to come out of

475
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,450
the market to have an S bomb

476
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,340
well regulation got the attention of the

477
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,280
healthcare sector and so they went off

478
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,020
and said we can we're going to show that

479
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,730
we can actually generate this today but

480
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,010
the medical device manufacturers can

481
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,200
generate the data and hospitals

482
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,580
including you know some of the best

483
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,520
hospitals in America and your

484
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,949
Vesey or sauna and Mayo Clinic were able

485
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,129
to use that data against predefined

486
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,960
risk-based use cases asset management

487
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:28,330
vulnerability management pre-purchase

488
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,920
risk decision-making that's the good

489
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,169
news they were able do it the bad news

490
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,060
is that without taking advantage of all

491
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,110
the work that I've just described no one

492
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,350
was able to do it in a completely

493
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:40,810
automated fashion and so that's really

494
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:44,649
where we're pivoting for for our next

495
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:46,060
steps this process is ongoing we're

496
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,500
continuing to refine and extend the

497
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,050
model I'm going to talk to you about a

498
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,800
few these challenges around namespace

499
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:55,600
but we're also trying to collect tooling

500
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,680
this is not just open source I know that

501
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,070
there are a number of companies out

502
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,960
there today that are working to solve

503
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:05,439
this exact problem for you that's great

504
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,780
I'm from the Department of Commerce my

505
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,850
agency believes in the power of people

506
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,620
making money especially when they're

507
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,699
providing a valuable good or service so

508
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,889
that's what we're trying to do is

509
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,570
capture as much of this as we can about

510
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,610
what's out there today and then of

511
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,340
course awareness and adoption that's

512
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,570
where a lot of you come in how do we get

513
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,850
this message out what are the benefits

514
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,189
how can this help your corner of the

515
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,600
security world and by the way would you

516
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,550
like to do a demonstration would you let

517
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,919
you do a proof of concept we have a

518
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,090
bunch of them ongoing this is your

519
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,710
chance to roll up your sleeves and

520
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,720
actually build something there are a few

521
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:40,780
challenges were trying to tackle very

522
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:43,660
briefly naming software is a known hard

523
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:45,520
problem I would argue that in the

524
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,220
history of IT over the last 40 years

525
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,290
we've successfully solved the

526
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,020
decentralized global name space problem

527
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,370
exactly once and the annual budget of

528
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,590
ICANN is about one hundred and forty

529
00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:00,100
million dollars so we're not gonna wreck

530
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,540
recreate DNS but we can make some

531
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,590
progress we're trying to figure out how

532
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,670
do we do this in a way that is neither

533
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:08,199
centralized nor requires everyone to

534
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,610
change what they're doing because that's

535
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,270
easy right a lot of the solutions are oh

536
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,459
this is super easy

537
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,440
everyone just do what I do and then

538
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,470
we'll all have the same model how do we

539
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,330
share s bomb data this is again we need

540
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,220
to make sure that it's getting into the

541
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,840
hands of people who need it the vision

542
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,110
here is not to say that there's one way

543
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,120
to do it it's to say here's a small set

544
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,639
of ways this problem can be solved pick

545
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,158
one that works for you

546
00:21:29,639 --> 00:21:33,389
one of the core challenges that a lot of

547
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,940
folks on them especially on the vendor

548
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:38,039
side are aware of is they said hey just

549
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,659
because something's vulnerable doesn't

550
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:43,529
mean that it's exploitable right I'm

551
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:45,749
using open SSL ODOT 9 but guess what

552
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,849
it's for a client-side piece of software

553
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:50,309
so by definition it cannot be heartbleed

554
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:52,559
able please turn off the blinking LED on

555
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,690
your dashboard how do we allow that kind

556
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,729
of communication to happen down the

557
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,259
supply chain in a way that means that we

558
00:21:56,729 --> 00:22:00,779
can start to pay attention and focus on

559
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:02,579
what's really important and of course I

560
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,950
mentioned the opportunity for a proof of

561
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:07,349
concept where since we have all this

562
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,969
information out there today could you

563
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:11,458
actually show that this could work for

564
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:12,539
your organization or whether you build

565
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:15,179
software or whether you're buying

566
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:17,459
software or you know somewhere in the

567
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:19,200
middle what could it what could help you

568
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:22,829
and what is the site motivation that you

569
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,369
need so taking a step back transparency

570
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:28,649
is part of the nutritious breakfast that

571
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:30,029
is going to be addressing the entire

572
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:32,399
issue of security in the supply chain

573
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:35,099
right it's messy there's a lot of stuff

574
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:37,349
there but transparency is going to be

575
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:38,218
the foundation for thinking about it

576
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:40,708
there are a lot of different solutions

577
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:44,190
out there to improve on this but they

578
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:46,709
all start with making sure that we know

579
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,499
what's actually under the hood of our

580
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:52,649
software so I have I think three minutes

581
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:55,679
left for questions you can use your app

582
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:58,168
I'm going to plea please get in touch

583
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,999
with me that's my email address if you

584
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,619
send me a note saying you want to join

585
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:03,119
I'll give you a sticker if you tweet

586
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:04,559
with the hashtag s bum I'll give you a

587
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,359
sticker if you ask the question I'll

588
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:11,129
give you a sticker you come up to me and

589
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:15,718
say hi I'll give you a sticker so let's

590
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:18,689
see does s bomb scope include hardware

591
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:21,899
and firmware so on firmware I would much

592
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:23,940
rather debate which of our text editors

593
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:25,498
is the superior in an objective fashion

594
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:29,609
then talk about the difference between

595
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:33,059
software and firmware what I will say is

596
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:35,129
for firmware did you write it if you

597
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:37,079
wrote it then it's your software it's

598
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:40,439
not their party components if you're

599
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,690
using third-party code in your firmware

600
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,250
then that's some

601
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,379
that you probably need to be aware of

602
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:51,080
and be able to track that hardware is a

603
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:53,149
different problem in some ways it's

604
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,340
easier especially at the sort of end of

605
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:57,408
high-end chips in some ways it's a lot

606
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,259
harder especially as you move down the

607
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:02,629
supply chain into hardware because ASCII

608
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:03,799
read a dim as a dim as a dim you're

609
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:04,699
looking at it from manufacturer

610
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,399
perspective you're saying this is just

611
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,240
askew so we're trying to just focus on

612
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:13,908
the software side of things so let's see

613
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,730
I have a there's a question which is is

614
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:19,190
an S bomb a tree or a directed acyclic

615
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,379
graph that is a great question

616
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:28,549
we will leave that as an exercise to the

617
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:30,678
reader so there's another great question

618
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:33,559
which is hey couldn't some source code

619
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,720
repository products like say github or

620
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,730
bitbucket think about this and try to

621
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,409
solve this for the entire ecosystem it's

622
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,490
a phenomenal idea I've had the

623
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:42,320
opportunity to work with a number of

624
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,909
folks from github that are very

625
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,439
interested in this github will do some

626
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:48,139
of this for you today they will flag

627
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,850
your dependencies that are risky so

628
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:51,439
we're starting this the challenges of

629
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,449
course while that gets us a lot of the

630
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,009
way it doesn't get us all the way there

631
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,950
especially when we're thinking about

632
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:59,659
commercial software commercial software

633
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,870
running on your network is sort of quite

634
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:05,149
the black box side of things other

635
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,620
questions in the room before I I think

636
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:07,668
I've hit the wrong button here there are

637
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:19,158
questions the room you can just shout

638
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:21,950
something out so that's that's a

639
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:24,889
fantastic question the first proof of

640
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,639
concept they decided for scoping reason

641
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:27,529
they were only going to use the

642
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:30,019
top-level dependencies as they've

643
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:32,809
started to look into this especially for

644
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:36,830
the art the art haces it's going to be

645
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:38,450
big and in fact there are a couple of I

646
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,840
know that someone has tried to write

647
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,070
this for one flavor of a Linux kernel

648
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,610
where they've activated will show yeah

649
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:49,639
listen we found the way we as we compile

650
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,019
it we can actually generate it so for

651
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:54,789
the large pieces of software this is

652
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:54,789
gonna be very large and

653
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,320
how many you got no I think it's a great

654
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,800
question

655
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,110
the I'm hazarding so I'd say on the

656
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,530
order of 10,000 components for a modern

657
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:11,240
operating system but again it's that's

658
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,960
that order of magnitude if you want to

659
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,910
know more about this scope the critical

660
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,010
infrastructure initiative with Frank

661
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:22,309
Nagel up at Harvard Business School just

662
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,480
wrote a report of the first analysis of

663
00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:28,730
their attempt to do an open source

664
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:30,590
census the data is heavily built or

665
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,210
heavily sampled on the JavaScript

666
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,669
universe because that's where the data

667
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,470
was classic street light problem but

668
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,880
that gets us some insight into what

669
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,100
these dependency trees look like and

670
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:45,350
where they overlap on getting the stop

671
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:47,649
sign so please don't hesitate to get in

672
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:51,290
touch I'll be out in the hallway after

673
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:53,570
this afternoon and I'll be around San

674
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,129
Francisco all week so please get in

675
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,030
touch and join us we need your help

676
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:01,380
thank you

677
00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:01,379
