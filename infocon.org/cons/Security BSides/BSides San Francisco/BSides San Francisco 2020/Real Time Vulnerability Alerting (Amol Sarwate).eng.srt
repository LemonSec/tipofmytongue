1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
okay today's talk at the moment is

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,290
real-time vulnerability analytics by

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,250
using principles from u.s. tsunami

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,900
warning center by a mosa wit he is the

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,109
head of security research at cloud

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,449
passage Inc and he heads cloud passage

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,609
worldwide security research responsible

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,769
for cloud focused vulnerability and

9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,779
compliance research he's devoted his

10
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,240
career to protecting securing and

11
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:35,700
educating the community from security

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:37,860
threats here is Emma thank you alright

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,079
so the talk that the title of the talk

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,480
is already mouthful real-time

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,770
vulnerability and Alex by using

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,339
principles from the US a tsunami warning

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,870
center

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:55,800
so as Tatyana mentioned my name is amal

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:01:01,218
and during my day job what we do at

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:04,500
cloud passages we provide solutions for

21
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:07,740
for for securing and visibility of your

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,250
cloud containers and traditional

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,699
workloads so real time vulnerability

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,640
analytics has been a pretty old topic I

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,439
mean this is people have been trying to

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,439
get real-time information on

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,139
vulnerabilities for the last I don't

28
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,199
know how many years do you think that's

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,200
happening I think about 20-25 years even

30
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,960
because I remember when I was in the mid

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:39,240
90s late 90s I was working for one of

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,839
the security vendors and even 23 25

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,640
years ago this topic of vulnerability

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,880
and Alex and real-time vulnerable

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,899
analytics was there so why is it that

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,570
after almost 20 to 25 years I am still

37
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,700
here talking about real-time

38
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,320
vulnerability and Alex and well there

39
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,930
are a few people here trying and trying

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,839
wanting to discuss that and I think the

41
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,539
main reason for that is

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,470
vulnerability landscape just changes so

43
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:15,829
rapidly and it does not really matter if

44
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,470
this is if this is ten year old 20 year

45
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,080
old I'm pretty sure 10 to 15 years down

46
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,489
the line we'll still be talking about

47
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,980
vulnerabilities vulnerability and Alex

48
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:31,370
and how to spot them so in in the next

49
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,230
30 to 40 minutes what we'll do is we

50
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,860
will look at the problem definition

51
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:40,010
we'll look at sort of a newer approach

52
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:43,130
that we took this time we will go over

53
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:46,640
some of the design and implementation of

54
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:50,540
that we'll go over a lot of examples

55
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,790
because I just I mean it's it's good to

56
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,760
have design implementation approach but

57
00:02:52,790 --> 00:03:00,489
when you see a system working with some

58
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:03,048
working examples that's when it really

59
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,700
it really solidifies what you're trying

60
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,130
to say so we'll go over a lot of

61
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,399
examples and then at the end of the day

62
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,040
we'll we'll conclude and look at some of

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,720
the future work that this project will

64
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:20,570
do so let's get started I mean this I

65
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,650
put this slide because really speaking

66
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,930
all of us see a tsunami of

67
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:30,470
vulnerabilities attacks exploits coming

68
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,450
your way every day I think some of you

69
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,200
must be security practitioners some of

70
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:38,060
you could be working at security vendors

71
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,018
and in some respect everyone is working

72
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,880
somehow in the security landscape and we

73
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:48,940
see this really tsunami of

74
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:52,340
vulnerabilities each and every day and

75
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,980
this is a this is a slide from CV

76
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,730
details calm everyone knows here what

77
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,899
the CVE

78
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,459
is right does it okay

79
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,730
everyone knows what a CV is it's it's

80
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:07,940
essentially a unique identifier that is

81
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:11,030
given to one let ability and there are

82
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,209
many companies one of them it's CV

83
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,329
details the track

84
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:19,168
how many vulnerabilities these are the

85
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:22,500
vulnerabilities by ear and on the right

86
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:25,919
hand side is 2019 last year where they

87
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,280
were according to them about 12,000

88
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,770
unique vulnerabilities and mind you

89
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,250
these are just unique vulnerability so

90
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:39,240
one of this vulnerability can be used by

91
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:44,580
many proof of concepts why many exploits

92
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,000
by many viruses malware and things like

93
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,300
that

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,479
so it gets really quickly multiplied by

95
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,660
the amount of bad things happening in

96
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:56,870
the industry and then it's at the end of

97
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,240
the day in your organization you have

98
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,370
hundreds and thousands of assets so it

99
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,860
again gets multiplied by those number of

100
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,169
assets so these are just unique

101
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,900
vulnerabilities just to show our fangs

102
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:12,690
how do generally and you can just this

103
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,340
is a small enough room how do you

104
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:18,230
currently get your vulnerability

105
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,789
information nvd nist cv details vendor

106
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,680
[Music]

107
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:28,289
whatwhat do you currently rely on anyone

108
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:30,300
wants to volunteer all of the above ok

109
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:34,199
that that's that's that's that's a very

110
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:37,250
good strategy because again getting it

111
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,260
from just one source is it's not really

112
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,870
gonna cut it so the point of this slide

113
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,030
is that when we have so many unique

114
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,220
vulnerabilities coming in and this is

115
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,719
just these are just approximate numbers

116
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,729
because as you know there are some

117
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,590
vulnerabilities in the nvidia database

118
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:54,150
which are not in this database which are

119
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:58,530
not in that database so you are always

120
00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:00,330
like sort of scrambling for finding the

121
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,520
truth and also not just the truth but

122
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,490
what's the vulnerability of that day

123
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:11,240
what is essentially of highest

124
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:16,259
criticality for that day so this is a

125
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,520
screenshot of of the Pacific Tsunami

126
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:20,680
Warning Center now

127
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,049
now you would say why why tsunamis all

128
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,660
of a sudden because there is a little

129
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,680
bit of a correlation or similarity

130
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:32,560
between vulnerabilities and tsunamis so

131
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:37,150
the root cause of tsunamis are

132
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:42,520
essentially earthquakes and earthquakes

133
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:45,370
can occur at any time so as I mentioned

134
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,289
that the root cause of most tsunamis are

135
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,630
earthquakes there are also obviously

136
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:51,810
landslides volcanic eruptions some other

137
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:54,699
causes also but the root cause of

138
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,460
tsunamis are earthquakes which cannot be

139
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:59,409
predicted but still even though

140
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,229
earthquakes cannot be predicted tsunami

141
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:06,280
warning centers do exist and they give

142
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:07,840
us very timely information on the

143
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,440
tsunamis that are going to hit our

144
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,830
shores

145
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,990
so earthquakes can be compared to one

146
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,550
other abilities just like earthquakes

147
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,340
you cannot really predict

148
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,139
vulnerabilities like I really I can tell

149
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,210
you like maybe five minutes ago what was

150
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:25,900
the high profile vulnerability but I

151
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:28,419
cannot predict what what's going to be

152
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,489
the most trending or high profile or

153
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:34,120
seismic vulnerability by the end of this

154
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:36,820
talk so similar to earthquakes you

155
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,150
cannot predict vulnerabilities but still

156
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,310
you have tsunami warning centers that

157
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:46,570
give us information in the nick of time

158
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:48,759
on on the dangers that are to come so a

159
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:52,770
thought came to my mind is like if you

160
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:55,270
can have tsunami warning centers

161
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,120
implemented in real life why can't we

162
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,818
have similarly vulnerability warning

163
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,919
centers which sort of get same cues

164
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:06,400
which are based on similar principles

165
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:09,818
similar ideas of a tsunami warning

166
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,880
center so I said okay let's take a quick

167
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:15,880
two minute look at how these tsunami

168
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,909
warning centers work so what they have

169
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,409
done is essentially and I promise this

170
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:22,139
will not take more than two minutes I

171
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:25,949
know you are here for vulnerable

172
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:28,680
and not knowing about tsunamis so what

173
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:30,509
what happens is they have a bunch of

174
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,029
sensors at the bottom of the Pacific

175
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:35,159
Ocean almost bolted or we have like

176
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:37,708
heavy weight so that there are these

177
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,468
sensors which are at the bottom of the

178
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:43,109
ocean and they continuously are

179
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:47,730
monitoring for some seismic activity

180
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:50,130
these sensors have I think it's too far

181
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,490
for the laser the sensors at the bottom

182
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,070
of the ocean they have some sort of a

183
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,140
bi-directional communication with some

184
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,990
of the buoys which are floating on the

185
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,769
water now what these buoys do is they

186
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,510
get data of assessments as macaque

187
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:09,750
tivity happening at the bottom of the

188
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:13,829
ocean they also collect data additional

189
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:16,949
data like water temperature surface

190
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:19,829
temperature wind a lot of additional

191
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:23,099
data nearby and then you have multiple

192
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:25,439
of such sensors and buoys which have and

193
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,660
the buoys are they have they have good

194
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,600
power they can talk with satellites

195
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:35,699
which then later communicate your data

196
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:38,100
to the data centers so essentially to

197
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:40,500
summarize we have some sensors at the

198
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,320
ocean floor which get data to the buoys

199
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,459
the buoys get the most important suspect

200
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:51,360
data as well as data metadata or data

201
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:53,579
for wind currents temperatures on and so

202
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,410
forth so collect additional data the

203
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:57,479
buoys have good power to communicate

204
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,569
with the satellites and get the data to

205
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,019
the data center now indeed this is this

206
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,290
is an example of a real-life buoy that

207
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,820
you would find in the Pacific somewhere

208
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,620
so once the data comes in the data

209
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,699
center there is a lot of data analytics

210
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:16,470
ttan not just based on the suspect data

211
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:19,620
because that's the number one cause for

212
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:24,149
tsunamis but also for data as you said

213
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:26,430
for historical data essentially what had

214
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:29,100
happened when such an earthquake occur

215
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,439
and the temperature words this and a lot

216
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,830
of such data analytics is then in the

217
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,720
data centers which at the end of

218
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,570
raises an alarm saying that okay you

219
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:46,400
could have a tsunami coming in the next

220
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:48,290
few hours or something like that so so

221
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,560
essentially that was the question is can

222
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,810
we use some of these things for can we

223
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,069
model over one our abilities based on

224
00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:01,699
earthquakes so we just went over one of

225
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,590
these things which is earthquakes cannot

226
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,580
be predicted vulnerabilities can also

227
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:10,450
not be predicted so what we decided was

228
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:13,600
to essentially take three these three

229
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,430
important components which are the

230
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,430
sensors and the dock and the buoys and

231
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:22,089
the communication and analytics and try

232
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:27,410
to put them in the context of

233
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:30,140
vulnerabilities so essentially we knew

234
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,709
we needed these three things one is data

235
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:36,740
collection fast communication and

236
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:39,530
analytics for data communication we

237
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,590
thought of a lot of things in the past

238
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:45,650
we had worked with honey pots and those

239
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:48,770
had given us very good results everyone

240
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:53,740
knows what a honeypot is right I see

241
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:57,050
some some hands okay so essentially the

242
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,990
advantage of honey pots are that you do

243
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:02,870
get to know about live attacks and

244
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,000
threats which is really good but there

245
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,460
are also some disadvantages one of the

246
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,220
biggest disadvantage is that the

247
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:14,270
vulnerability has to be weaponized and

248
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:17,330
being used in real life by either some

249
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:19,220
attackers or by some vulnerability

250
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,310
scanners from one of the vendors who are

251
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,930
scanning the Internet continuously for

252
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:27,680
your honeypot to catch that

253
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:30,620
vulnerability so it's already a little

254
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,390
too late because at that time a proof of

255
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,180
concept for the vulnerability is already

256
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:37,370
out there someone has already converted

257
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,709
the proof of concept into a mechanized

258
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,910
script or something which really works

259
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,920
or

260
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,810
in the worst case adversaries are

261
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,699
already making use of that vulnerability

262
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:50,479
that and therefore your honeypot was

263
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,760
able to catch it so this time we did not

264
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,440
go with honey pots although I'm not

265
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,540
saying honey pots are not useful they

266
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,840
are tremendously useful but for this

267
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:03,230
particular real-time alerting we thought

268
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:05,510
that honey pots were too slow also the

269
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,000
type of vulnerabilities that the honey

270
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:10,220
pots can catch are limited so

271
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,830
essentially a honey pot can catch only a

272
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,470
vulnerability that essentially has a

273
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:19,250
listening port which attacker can

274
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:22,010
actively send packets to so again in

275
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,230
today's day and world with CI CD and you

276
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:27,490
know a lot of you are ops engineers

277
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:30,440
nowadays you don't even have SSH running

278
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,150
the the usability of honey pots for at

279
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,270
least for this project was was not

280
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:37,340
really great well the second thing that

281
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,410
we have always we had always done as an

282
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:42,560
industry also and as well as me

283
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:44,600
personally in my career was analysis

284
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,719
reverse engineering manually tracking of

285
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:51,290
these threats and this is also a very

286
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,630
effective approach especially reverse

287
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,089
engineering and manual analysis because

288
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:59,510
you can actually tell what the attacker

289
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:02,480
was thinking when he or she wrote that

290
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:05,500
code or that piece of malware but again

291
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,450
for the purpose of this project it was

292
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,160
it just cannot scale in the sense you

293
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,360
cannot get real-time vulnerability

294
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,140
analysis

295
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,390
analysis data on manual reversing it is

296
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:21,710
a very effective tool to know the nuts

297
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:25,930
and bolts of a particular malware or

298
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:31,010
exploit but scaling it is an issue

299
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:32,750
timing is an issue also I mean again I

300
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,780
this is not a reverse engineering talk

301
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,270
but it is a fantastic tool but for this

302
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,329
purpose that we were and we have we have

303
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,960
successfully used this in the past but

304
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,480
for this particular

305
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:49,200
problem that we wanted to solve which is

306
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:53,010
real-time vulnerably alert ring that

307
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,920
just was not going to work so instead

308
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,590
what we said was instead of going to a

309
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,750
totally honeypot reverse engineering

310
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:04,080
manual tracking that type of solution

311
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,210
let's go with something that a lot of

312
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,930
people are doing which is collecting

313
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:15,180
public information on attacks on

314
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:18,770
exploits on data leaks via various blogs

315
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:21,599
via various exploit databases very via

316
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:25,350
even things like Twitter and LinkedIn

317
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,660
and let's try to see if we can get

318
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,760
better data that way then going through

319
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,800
the way of honey pots and trying to

320
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,780
capture the actual attacks and things

321
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,199
like that so we said okay let's let's

322
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:39,300
give this a try so the technology we use

323
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,490
there is nothing very specific about

324
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,800
this this is just some tools that we

325
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:47,970
were already familiar with so we just

326
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:52,589
used those so we created this system in

327
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:54,540
AWS we used if you remember we needed

328
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:59,100
three different components one is data

329
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:01,829
collection so we wrote a bunch of lambda

330
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,420
functions for data collection and we'll

331
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,670
get into the details on how these

332
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:10,050
lambdas look like and what did they do

333
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:13,260
for storage we used a really old style

334
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:15,719
prose Christ sequel database because the

335
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,780
data that we were looking at was not

336
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,530
like in beta by type of data I mean you

337
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:25,380
have under the Sun maybe 150,000 or so

338
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,689
unique owner abilities so if you even

339
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:30,990
multiply that with five or ten you are

340
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:33,450
not going to get petabyte of data or

341
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:36,279
something like that so our data was

342
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,439
relatively small so a simple

343
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:41,949
school sequel database would have

344
00:16:38,439 --> 00:16:45,430
sufficed and it did and then we wrote a

345
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:50,319
bunch of data analytics function which

346
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:52,209
would sort of process this data and and

347
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:53,110
give it weights and so on and so forth

348
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:57,819
which we'll look

349
00:16:53,110 --> 00:17:00,129
look at in in a moment so the design of

350
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:03,099
the system was like this we had a bunch

351
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:05,289
of data collection lambdas each of this

352
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,110
lambda function collected data from a

353
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:10,530
particular source so one of the lambda

354
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:13,599
function let's say collected data from

355
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:16,270
nvd this is a very common source I think

356
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,399
most of you would already have it one of

357
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,500
the lambda functions collected data from

358
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,470
one of the exploit databases free

359
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,980
databases like exploit DB or some of the

360
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:29,650
proprietary or paid exploit databases

361
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,659
one lambda function as I said it went

362
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,000
through just some of the security

363
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:37,780
researcher blogs that we have trusted

364
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,520
for so many years some one of some of

365
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:43,240
the lambda functions just browsed

366
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,520
through vendor advisories and vendor

367
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,559
feeds and the information that the

368
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,070
vendors like Microsoft Red Hat all these

369
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:53,649
vendors come up with and all this data

370
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,620
one on one of the lambda functions was

371
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:59,039
for Twitter because whenever there is a

372
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:02,139
high profile vulnerability before the

373
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,860
like everyone sort of talks about it

374
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:08,020
there are some few key key folks who

375
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,000
talk about it tweet about it so we said

376
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,490
hey let's not forget that data let's

377
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,200
scrape that data as well so we got that

378
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:20,110
data and all this data went into our

379
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:24,070
database which was then given to the

380
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:25,840
analytics lambda now the analytics

381
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:30,189
lambda what it did was it well it is a

382
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,610
very simple weight base algorithm this

383
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:36,190
is not AI this is not ml I know I mean

384
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,600
at this age and if you are talking at a

385
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,150
security conference and if you are not

386
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,800
doing

387
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:45,590
I or email it's almost out there but we

388
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,139
didn't really at that time needed that

389
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,030
type of capability because our data was

390
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,460
not like that because for a Imad you

391
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:55,580
really need a lot of data to learn from

392
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:59,630
to create your models from and we just

393
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:02,060
didn't had that type of data so what our

394
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,700
analytics function did was it just

395
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:07,700
assigned weights to each of these

396
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:10,250
sources and then calculated the

397
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,920
resultant for that particular boner

398
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:16,000
ability or CVE so to give you an example

399
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:20,180
the weight for lambda function which

400
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,360
which got data from n VD was very low

401
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,070
very and and the reason for that is n VD

402
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,780
we knew it's a data source for

403
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:30,260
vulnerabilities just because the

404
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:32,240
vulnerability is on n VD does not really

405
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,400
mean that it's a high-priority

406
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,710
vulnerability it's a tsunami type of

407
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,160
vulnerability or its it can cause like

408
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:42,260
cess makeshift in your organization so

409
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,680
the weight age given for data sources

410
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:49,040
like n VD was really low if a

411
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,920
vulnerability was found on one of the

412
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,510
exploit databases then yeah the wait for

413
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,410
that would be a little bit higher

414
00:19:53,510 --> 00:20:01,879
because now it's not just on n VD on one

415
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:04,070
or one of your data collection one of

416
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,700
your vulnerability databases but it is

417
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:10,700
also being exploited if it is found if

418
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:14,870
the data analytics did some analysis on

419
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:18,230
on the blogs that we were looking at and

420
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:20,810
from the analysis if the data analytics

421
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:23,350
Indian found that this one that this

422
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:26,330
this particular blog is talking about an

423
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:28,429
exploit or a possible exploit about that

424
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:34,389
vulnerability then the wait for that was

425
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:37,220
higher and that in that part some of the

426
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,770
natural language processing and those

427
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:42,350
type of algorithms were used but

428
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:44,050
initially we gave gave them also very

429
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,030
low weight because we were not

430
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:49,030
really very confident on how well they

431
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:51,430
work so for example given a blog post

432
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,920
you are writing a computer program to

433
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:58,840
find out what it is about if it is about

434
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:00,940
the vulnerability what is what is is

435
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,040
it's the blog post saying that this is a

436
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,270
low profile or nobility medium profile

437
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,420
vulnerability or high profile

438
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:09,070
vulnerability you can do do those type

439
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,680
of things and we have done those but

440
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:14,740
initially we even give those a little

441
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:19,540
bit low priority I think high priority

442
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:22,000
was given to things like just how many

443
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,070
times you saw that same type of

444
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,380
vulnerability in a given period of time

445
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:29,639
from different data sources and from

446
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:33,550
different things from the internet so

447
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:37,660
that is essentially what this analytics

448
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:40,690
engine did and then it created as an

449
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:45,340
output of the system was some graphs and

450
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:48,430
some charts that would tell you on what

451
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,590
it thinks what the system thinks are the

452
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:54,430
releases make vulnerabilities the really

453
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:56,590
high profile vulnerabilities for that

454
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,310
particular hour that particular day and

455
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:03,760
so on and so forth so we ran this engine

456
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:06,580
continuously and started watching the

457
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,190
results as a matter of fact now the

458
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:14,439
engine is running for about two years

459
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:16,030
and let me let me give you an example of

460
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,580
some of the data that we collected in

461
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:22,870
the first month so we started in

462
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:26,439
December of 2017 about two years ago and

463
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:28,810
this is what so we had we started the

464
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,270
engine we said ok and then there were

465
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:34,780
some vacations Christmas we went home

466
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:39,780
when we came back in Jan this is what we

467
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:44,320
saw the data at that time we and on the

468
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:48,280
on the x-axis what you have or the days

469
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,879
so currently I've plotted the data for D

470
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,310
and on the y-axis what you have is the

471
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,530
vulnerability intelligence quotient so

472
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:59,100
it is just a number

473
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:01,620
that the algorithm created for that

474
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:04,530
particular CV or that particular one

475
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,678
vulnerability and the dots that you see

476
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:10,289
those are individual vulnerabilities so

477
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,559
in one month which is which was a very

478
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:15,900
short time we saw that okay this

479
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,539
particular Microsoft malware protection

480
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,840
remote code execution vulnerability came

481
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:26,940
on top the second one was the Palo Alto

482
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:31,549
Networks pan OS remote code execution

483
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:35,280
based on the on the management interface

484
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:38,100
so I mean we on a day-to-day basis we

485
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,020
are responsible for in our day jobs we

486
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,149
what we do is we look at these

487
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,760
vulnerabilities create datasets for

488
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:47,309
detection of these vulnerabilities

489
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,740
release these datasets so that same day

490
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:52,168
next day whatever as quickly as possible

491
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:55,140
our customers can identify these

492
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:56,760
vulnerabilities in their organization so

493
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,340
we were pretty familiar with the

494
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,840
landscape and then when all the

495
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,299
engineers looked at the data we said

496
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,970
that yeah if we had to do this manually

497
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:10,789
we also would have sort of rated these

498
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:13,200
two vulnerabilities on top now

499
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:17,940
vulnerability classification is as much

500
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,740
as as much as the art at science so

501
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,780
there could be many other remote code

502
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,929
execution vulnerabilities there could be

503
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:27,240
many other vulnerabilities that have

504
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:29,429
more grave impact but then you have to

505
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,710
take into consideration a lot of

506
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:35,039
different aspects of that vulnerability

507
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:37,110
so for example if there is a

508
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,240
vulnerability in in the malware

509
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:42,059
production engine itself which is

510
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,669
supposed to cause catch malware and if

511
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:47,039
that belongs to a very widely known

512
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:49,860
operating system then you would say yes

513
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:52,260
I would put that on top or things like

514
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,668
that but anyway the first one data we

515
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,830
have to be happy with that we were not

516
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:58,409
very confident with it because it was

517
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:00,189
just an experiment what we decided was

518
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:03,129
to just keep the

519
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:05,860
keep keep the engine running and see

520
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:08,439
what data it gives over the course of

521
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,600
time these are just some of the

522
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,750
parameters of the two vulnerabilities

523
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:16,330
that I discussed these are from various

524
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:21,759
open sources they're CBS s course and

525
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:24,009
things like that by the way in in in

526
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:28,000
that in the data analytics part of it we

527
00:25:24,009 --> 00:25:29,889
did not use the CBS s sub matrix for

528
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,009
this vulnerability and you will you will

529
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:35,709
come I will discuss why that why that

530
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:38,789
was the case everyone knows about CBS s

531
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:41,850
or have heard about that right anyone

532
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:45,370
it's essentially just a scoring system

533
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:48,459
where every vulnerability is scored and

534
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:50,350
it is a very fantastic system and we'll

535
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:54,730
we'll look at that a little bit more

536
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:58,240
later so after a month of data we said

537
00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:02,370
okay data is trickling in and everything

538
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:07,990
is fine but just in five days about in

539
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:11,620
Jan of 2018 sort of the alarm started to

540
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:17,350
go off and you can see the December data

541
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:21,008
which is on the right-hand side of ya on

542
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,629
the right-hand side and in Jan it's just

543
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:24,730
alarm started going off we started

544
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:29,129
hitting vulnerabilities that we are five

545
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:32,169
times more that we have ever seen anyone

546
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:37,149
even try to guess what what these

547
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:42,960
vulnerabilities could be Jan of 2018 so

548
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:46,479
these I'm sorry say you said something

549
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,399
eternal blue will come so these were the

550
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,519
meltdown and the spectre of ulnar

551
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:55,120
abilities if you remember I mean these

552
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:58,000
were in the Intel CPU microprocessors

553
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,949
and since they were in the

554
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,740
microprocessor side-channel at type of

555
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:05,740
attacks everyone and anyone was affected

556
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,419
they were more cloud providers were

557
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,600
affected by it because you know they

558
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:12,360
used Intel processors and

559
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,090
I don't think we need any introduction

560
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,059
for these two vulnerabilities so when

561
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,220
again we in our meetings when we looked

562
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:22,260
at it was at all cool I mean looks like

563
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,990
the system is doing what it is supposed

564
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,450
to do because these were as you could

565
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:30,750
remember in the last ten years I did not

566
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:33,510
remember any bigger vulnerability of

567
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:37,200
this magnitude which affected so many

568
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:42,390
systems and had really like a tsunami

569
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,789
type of suspec impact so we were highly

570
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,590
encouraged by the results because

571
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:49,110
usually we see these low-level

572
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:56,809
vulnerabilities and then all of a sudden

573
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:59,580
meltdown Spectre the counts went up so

574
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:05,149
when we talked about this internally to

575
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:08,280
our security teams we we soon came to

576
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:11,190
realization that we needed an easy way

577
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,289
to classify this we cannot go and give

578
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,510
them the y axis which is the

579
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:16,980
vulnerability quotient which could be

580
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,230
like two thousand eight hundred and

581
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,789
seventy-five I mean if a person looks at

582
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,919
if a security person looks at it he is

583
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:25,260
going to say what what is this which

584
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:28,789
compared to what I mean how do I know

585
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:32,309
that 100 is good and two thousand is bad

586
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:35,190
so there was I mean very quickly we

587
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:37,168
realize that just the raw numbers are

588
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:41,340
not gonna cut it if we want this to be

589
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:45,080
adapt adopted even internally so we came

590
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:48,870
up with classification system low

591
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:52,250
elevated high and critical and this

592
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:55,739
classification system was based again

593
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:58,740
non on a very complex formula or

594
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:02,039
something but it was simply ratios and

595
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,549
we just fine-tune these ratios a bit so

596
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:09,679
this is what we came at that time the

597
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:09,679
green worse the low priority

598
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:16,460
the then the yellows orange which is not

599
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,370
looking like orange here and then then

600
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,530
the red ones so essentially if you

601
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,330
classify if we classified them into

602
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:27,350
these different categories it was just a

603
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:30,789
lot easier for everyone in the company

604
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:33,668
and possibly we had some other POC when

605
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:36,919
customers to understand what the data is

606
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:40,370
so interesting facts and we are still in

607
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:43,580
just the first month of this is that in

608
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:46,668
the same month if you look at the CBS s

609
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,770
course on the left hand side are the CBS

610
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:51,440
scores of various vulnerabilities that

611
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:54,650
found that we are found exactly in that

612
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,809
month you see that there were about 96

613
00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:00,650
vulnerabilities the one in there at the

614
00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:02,830
end which were of score between nine to

615
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:05,870
ten so the most the highest-priority

616
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:09,080
vulnerabilities according to CBS s there

617
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:13,158
were 96 such wasn't abilities death that

618
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:17,389
month but in our alerting system we

619
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:20,630
found four and that actually was very

620
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:22,760
encouraging because as security

621
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:25,730
practitioners you would know that you

622
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,370
get essentially the entire industry and

623
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:30,380
security practitioners are flooded with

624
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:35,149
this tsunami of vulnerabilities where

625
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:37,460
everything is security school rating of

626
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,740
10 so if everything has a security a

627
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,429
score of rating of 10 how how do you

628
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:45,260
really classify what sucess m'q type of

629
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:47,870
vulnerability and what's a vulnerability

630
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:51,230
that just getting the score of 10

631
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:53,000
because it checks all these boxes it is

632
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:55,010
a remote code execution it can be

633
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,409
accessed over the network access

634
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:02,000
complexity is low and things like that

635
00:30:57,409 --> 00:31:06,380
so again I'm not against CBS s in fact

636
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,309
we have used CBS s for a lot of years

637
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,379
and I was active in one of

638
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:13,120
one of my previous employers when I was

639
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:17,590
working there we were actively involved

640
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,748
in creating this CBS s standard so it is

641
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:23,230
definitely very important I think if you

642
00:31:19,749 --> 00:31:25,659
remember the days before CBS s there was

643
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:28,230
a big sort of chaos in the industry

644
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:30,059
because every vendor used to rate this

645
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:34,360
there a particular vulnerability

646
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:37,269
differently and CBS s came in and sort

647
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:41,860
of really calmed that down and this was

648
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:46,840
one central authority mitre which which

649
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:49,840
gave scores and they sort of did and

650
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,820
still keep doing very good work but one

651
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,730
of the things that you see just because

652
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:57,639
of the nature of the same nature of CBS

653
00:31:54,730 --> 00:32:00,610
s is that it is strictly a formula based

654
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:04,949
system so it does not take into

655
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:07,959
consideration a lot of things like what

656
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:10,450
what if the vulnerability is exploited

657
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,549
currently in the wild or what our

658
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,919
security researchers think think about

659
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:16,480
you think about this vulnerability what

660
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:19,960
is the possibility of this vulnerability

661
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,389
to become big or really get exploited so

662
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,309
some of the vendors like Microsoft on

663
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:28,449
every Patch Tuesday they actually they

664
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:30,580
give very good guidance that what what

665
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:33,759
do they expect would this vulnerability

666
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:37,269
be exploited in the next 30 days which

667
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:40,570
is their sort of case again so all those

668
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:43,149
things are not present in CBS s as a

669
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,408
result of which a lot of vulnerabilities

670
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:46,869
these are just one month of

671
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:49,269
vulnerabilities and you had about 96

672
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:52,990
vulnerabilities with a score of 10 the

673
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:55,570
highest score and I think our system

674
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:58,779
gave just four which were actually just

675
00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:03,879
these two vulnerabilities the meltdown

676
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:08,740
and Spector each of them had to see B so

677
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:10,959
that became four so let's keep

678
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:13,149
collecting data I mean any of such

679
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,059
project we want to really make sure that

680
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:20,399
we have good data and in the next six

681
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:23,918
months we we collected some more data

682
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,719
nothing says make happened adds spectra

683
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,330
and married down which was actually good

684
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,220
because we do not want to alert people

685
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:33,009
we do not want to alert ourselves saying

686
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:35,019
that hey there is on every day there is

687
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:37,210
some huge vulnerability so in the next

688
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:40,500
six months we didn't find any

689
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:44,289
vulnerability that could crack that red

690
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,809
red barrier which would go into the

691
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:48,700
likes of spectra and meltdown there were

692
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:50,529
some vulnerabilities which were in

693
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,879
orange and I think I have highlighted

694
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:56,350
one or two one was the tuple code

695
00:33:53,879 --> 00:34:01,000
execution vulnerability another one was

696
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:04,418
a pretty big DHCP client script code

697
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,399
execution vulnerability and again since

698
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:08,799
we look at this vulnerabilities day in

699
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,960
and day out like one of the things that

700
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:13,750
we did was we had just these weekly

701
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,520
reviews of what the system produced with

702
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,949
our engineers to say that hey if you had

703
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,889
to manually classify a vulnerability

704
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:23,949
would you really do it this way and we

705
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:26,560
were sort of taking that manual analysis

706
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:28,868
of our security engineers to see if

707
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,560
their system is producing correct result

708
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:35,049
so at least expected results or not so

709
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,168
that's what happened in six months again

710
00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:41,310
now if you have been using CBS s there

711
00:34:38,168 --> 00:34:44,168
were more than a thousand CBS s

712
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:46,299
vulnerable at vulnerabilities with CBS a

713
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:48,739
score of 10 and again I'm not even

714
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:51,350
looking at the greens and the orange and

715
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:55,668
the yellows these are I'm just looking

716
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:58,160
at the last bar in the CBS s diagram

717
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:59,900
these are the level 10 vulnerabilities

718
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,420
so nothing can these are the

719
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,630
vulnerabilities that have the highest

720
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:07,760
score of between nine to ten so there

721
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,280
were about thousand there and we were

722
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,780
still at four which were the still the

723
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:17,420
spectre and meltdown which again was a

724
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,310
very good thing because if you want you

725
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,740
can go down and look at the nineteen

726
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:24,230
high-priority ones or you can go down

727
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:28,660
further and look at the nine ninety five

728
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:31,970
yellow or elevated ones but I think the

729
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:34,069
what what most of the most of the

730
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:38,899
challenge that the industry is having is

731
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:42,380
prioritization and I think this this

732
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:45,560
actually tells a very good story so we

733
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:51,080
said okay let's keep it running one year

734
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:55,430
data so we we did see in in one year we

735
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:58,009
did see some more neural ADIZ that that

736
00:35:55,430 --> 00:36:01,759
way that that started becoming like melt

737
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:03,560
down or like Spectre so one of these

738
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,190
vulnerabilities I think you may remember

739
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:10,490
it was a ssh vulnerability so someone

740
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:13,850
could connect without any credentials to

741
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:15,709
your ssh server if you are not recalling

742
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:18,950
it there are CVS at the end of the

743
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:22,369
presentation so do look up and that got

744
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,960
a really high hit again when we did we

745
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:25,580
were always doing manual sort of

746
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,430
analysis to see if the system is

747
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:30,049
producing correct resource and yeah I

748
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,089
mean all the security engineer said yeah

749
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,580
it says it vulnerability logging in

750
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:39,020
remotely without credentials that's

751
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:40,910
that's that that's a big event so at

752
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:45,380
this point we were pretty confident we

753
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:48,490
sort of expanded on some of our POC

754
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:53,140
customers and started talking about this

755
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:57,549
and also kept comparing against CBS s

756
00:36:53,140 --> 00:37:01,049
which by now I mean if you had done your

757
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:04,980
triage based on CBS s you would have to

758
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:07,110
threw about 1,500 vulnerabilities which

759
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,720
you say are really really critical and

760
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:12,300
it does not work when you say thousands

761
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,580
of vulnerabilities are the most critical

762
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,120
vulnerabilities I mean nine or ten

763
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,980
vulnerabilities you say ten well the

764
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,630
system that we developed produce ten

765
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,790
vulnerabilities in a year that we're

766
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,850
really critical and then that is

767
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,830
manageable if you say I have 1500

768
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:32,250
vulnerabilities which have a score

769
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:34,470
between 9 to 10 and then again some

770
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:37,830
2,000 Mulliner abilities between 8 to 9

771
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:40,080
then it's just in real life I'm sure you

772
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:45,840
can relate to this it just doesn't get

773
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:52,650
in scale fast forward there's your blue

774
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:55,800
keep what we saw was again the Microsoft

775
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:58,770
blue key blue keep RDP vulnerability

776
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,840
that was able to crack into the red zone

777
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:06,270
in about 1.5 years and then we also had

778
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:09,770
this whatsapp vulnerability by which you

779
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:12,750
could send a packet and just cause

780
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:16,460
remote code execution on the whatsapp

781
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:20,070
messenger that also cracked into the red

782
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:24,030
so they'd all look pretty good again we

783
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:28,290
did comparison with CBS s same thing and

784
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:31,490
this is essentially all the data that we

785
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:35,520
have collected in the last 2 years or so

786
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:39,959
just a few weeks ago there were a few

787
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:42,780
vulnerabilities like now this is few

788
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,400
weeks old so I'm assuming at security

789
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,650
professionals all of you have heard

790
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,040
about this this is the vulnerability

791
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:53,610
that was found by NSA they reported it

792
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:57,529
to Microsoft it was a vulnerability in

793
00:38:53,610 --> 00:39:00,720
the way certificates are processed so

794
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:02,550
that well there are two aspects of it

795
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,370
let me first tell you why this

796
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:07,530
vulnerability now is the highest-ranking

797
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:09,089
vulnerability in our two-year database

798
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:12,140
if you see to the left

799
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:16,250
even the meltdown inspector

800
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:18,740
vulnerabilities in the they are really

801
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:21,290
low as compared to this and secondly I

802
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,629
would like to talk about the change that

803
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:26,060
I that we did to the algorithm that

804
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,680
scores this now you see that the spectra

805
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,380
and meltdown vulnerabilities they are

806
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,390
now in orange and no longer in red

807
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:34,880
because now we have a new king now we

808
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,460
have a new red we have someone who has

809
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,130
taken that sparked up so we will talk

810
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:43,460
about these two things so the core of

811
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:45,380
all vulnerability I mean it's it was in

812
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,570
the elliptical core of algorithm

813
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,960
essentially your certificates are signed

814
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:53,780
with various their RSA or elliptical

815
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,670
curve or something like that and the

816
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:58,430
vulnerability was in the implementation

817
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:01,550
of the elliptical curves

818
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:04,069
so what Windows do is that when when it

819
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:06,950
gets a certificated source it in the in

820
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:11,270
its cache and when it looks at another

821
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:13,759
certificate it compares the signature to

822
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:16,009
the signature of what it has in the

823
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,920
cache but the implementation flaw was

824
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:22,070
that it did not check what curve was

825
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,500
being used so it just does not have to

826
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:27,530
see if the signatures match but you also

827
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:30,380
have to see what all the curve algorithm

828
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:32,510
was used and Windows I mean and then it

829
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:35,450
happens with I mean there it's nothing

830
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:37,340
against Windows I can point to you to

831
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:39,669
like many other vulnerabilities in each

832
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:43,640
operating systems that are like this but

833
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:47,180
even after 25 years in Windows there was

834
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:49,609
a flaw where it did not compare that

835
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,799
curve algorithm because of which anyone

836
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,930
could create a fraudulent certificate

837
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,140
for google.com bankofamerica.com

838
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:59,839
anything and in your browser when you

839
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:01,460
open that site it will just appear as a

840
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,200
good certificate or essentially you

841
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:06,570
could you could fool

842
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:09,450
fool in believing that this is a valid

843
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:11,430
certificate so I mean when our engineers

844
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:13,140
so I mean when any I mean when you hear

845
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:15,390
about it you can immediately tell her I

846
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,250
don't buy god this is like wow the

847
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:20,790
fundamental of secrets fundamentals of

848
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:23,850
security TLS and public key cryptography

849
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:25,529
it's obviously not a flaw in the

850
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:29,730
algorithm but in the implementation of

851
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:31,890
the algorithm so once again we were we

852
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:37,410
are at this point very confident that

853
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:40,080
this sort of art science system that we

854
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:43,740
have built is giving us pretty good

855
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:46,440
results and alerting us only on the

856
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,660
highest criticality or her highest

857
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,880
priority or are really suspect Wallner

858
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:53,730
abilities and we can sort of ignore a

859
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,740
lot of the low level noise now the

860
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:57,960
second thing which I mentioned I wanted

861
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:01,229
to talk about was that we changed our

862
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:04,070
algorithm on how they are scored so now

863
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:07,110
if someone got a scored of let's say

864
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:10,170
2800 which is the same as married down

865
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:12,870
inspector we would only give that an

866
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:15,690
orange and not a red and we are still

867
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:17,520
debating on how to change it we would

868
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,960
need to change the score because the way

869
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,210
the system works is it collects data

870
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,360
from lot of sources and as you know

871
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:27,510
there is more and more data generated on

872
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,240
vulnerabilities so we do expect that we

873
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:33,660
will get higher and higher scores going

874
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,120
forward so this is the first time in two

875
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:39,149
years we changed the scoring mechanism

876
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:40,859
I think our what we are thinking is that

877
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:44,490
we should instead of doing this in one

878
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:46,800
go we sort of need to change the scoring

879
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:49,529
slowly as we go because as the system

880
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,930
collects more and more data this the way

881
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:56,970
it works right now is the scores are

882
00:42:51,930 --> 00:43:01,919
slowly getting higher up and up so

883
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:05,970
that's the second thing that I was like

884
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:10,370
I was wanting to point out so well if

885
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:13,379
anything just take a screenshot of this

886
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:15,160
this slide I'm sure the slides are

887
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,230
available for download as well but

888
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,810
in take a picture if you are a

889
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:23,080
practitioner just go back and make sure

890
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:26,680
you don't have these sort of top 10 bad

891
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:29,020
boys of in the last two years which at

892
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:32,799
least according to the system that we

893
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:34,750
built had the highest or the systemic

894
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,050
level of these vulnerabilities were

895
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:40,570
really high and they could really cause

896
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:43,140
tsunami of flood of viruses worms or

897
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:47,140
really bad things in your organization

898
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:49,020
so our future work one is definitely we

899
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:52,210
are think we are looking at how to

900
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:56,740
deliver this data to the community how

901
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:58,990
to make these a bunch of did this

902
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,839
project open source project and expose

903
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:06,100
it to the community so that is I think

904
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:07,690
right now the top priority as far as the

905
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:10,569
project itself is concerned we are

906
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:12,190
thinking on classification so not

907
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:16,150
everyone is interested in every

908
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:17,920
vulnerability so if you are doing let's

909
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:20,530
say application security at company ABC

910
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,330
then you may not be interested in the

911
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,160
kubernetes vulnerability or some

912
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:28,330
infrastructure vulnerability you may be

913
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:31,200
have only dedicated focus area of focus

914
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:33,490
so that is something that we are

915
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,529
thinking of adding so that you can just

916
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:38,049
subscribe to the vulnerabilities or type

917
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:40,210
of vulnerabilities that you would like

918
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:43,690
to see and then the system can just give

919
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:49,270
you the same results but only filtered

920
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:52,450
them based on your preferences more sort

921
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:55,509
of correlation with targeted attacks

922
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:57,609
malware exploits and things like that we

923
00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:00,820
already have something in place but we

924
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:02,500
want to expand it more and also some

925
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:06,190
root cause analysis and classification

926
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:08,170
so that if as an industry you can see

927
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:11,230
that okay for most of my vulnerability

928
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:13,960
zuv type this they were caused because

929
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:18,040
of this and then as an industry we can

930
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,900
just improve on on that root cause again

931
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:24,069
I mentioned earlier we currently do not

932
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:26,769
use we do use some AI but not

933
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:30,519
I would say the bulk of the system does

934
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:35,169
not really use ml or AI and there have

935
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:37,390
been so many ready-to-use libraries and

936
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:39,969
things like that in here WS GCP and

937
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:42,459
assure that now it has come to a point

938
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:46,329
where we could theoretically really

939
00:45:42,459 --> 00:45:49,479
train what algorithm to read tons and

940
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:52,119
tons of blog posts every day find out

941
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:54,910
what the meaning of the blog post

942
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:57,219
automatically and coming to a severity

943
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:59,769
and then we can compare that with our

944
00:45:57,219 --> 00:46:01,869
existing favorite severity mechanism and

945
00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:03,819
then sort of get some interesting

946
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:06,430
research saying that okay we it is

947
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:08,739
possible now for us to write a crawler

948
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:11,198
who can just read through all the blog's

949
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:13,299
all the research articles all the papers

950
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,430
that are being published and really find

951
00:46:13,299 --> 00:46:18,279
the meaning of those papers so that is

952
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:22,479
an interesting thing that we would like

953
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:24,249
to do going forward so that's it for the

954
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:27,160
talk I think we have maybe one or two

955
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:29,439
minutes or maybe not I think we do have

956
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,359
a couple of minutes okay I apologize the

957
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,880
site is not set up so if you have a

958
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:37,799
question just raise your hand high keep

959
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,799
it up and I'll bring you the microphone

960
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:50,820
all right okay all right thank you so

961
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:50,819
much I'm well thank you
