1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,450
so hello I'm very jet-lagged I only came

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:09,300
in about a day and a half ago and I'm

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,240
leaving again tomorrow night so yeah I

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,599
know really really quick travels to

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,580
America real quick this isn't something

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,470
I would normally do but I wanted to say

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,479
I'm sure all aware that there's been a

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,340
small bushfire issue down in Australia

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,859
in the last couple of months I know a

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,660
lot of people in the states have like

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,539
contributed and I know everyone sent

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,090
their well wishes it has been really bad

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,320
I don't even live out in the communities

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,210
where that's been really affected but

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,390
we've seen all the smoke it's been very

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,340
scary and horrible so I would never

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,590
normally do this if you go to that QR

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,320
code I'm sure lots of you have already

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,480
been very kind and given your time and

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,920
money and this isn't a thing you have to

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,629
do but if you go to that website that

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,820
you can find behind the QR code I

23
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,710
realize I'm in a security conference and

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,590
I promise this is not a malicious link

25
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,030
before anyone thinks it that goes to a

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,489
website that you may not have seen over

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,530
here which is it's called

28
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,729
it's my shower and basically you can pay

29
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:12,090
for products to buy someone a coffee buy

30
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,220
someone a beer like buy someone a bed in

31
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,810
a B&B because a lot of the communities

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,220
that have been affected by bushfires are

33
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,350
the rural communities which are

34
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,000
dependent on tourism and of course

35
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,229
nobody is going there at the moment a

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,880
lot of people have cancelled their

37
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,320
holidays and now we have coronavirus so

38
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,929
worth checking out if you want to buy

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,539
someone a coffee cuz those guys and guys

40
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,400
and girls are not doing so well so yeah

41
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,360
I promise it's not a malicious link I'm

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,890
not so I'm not fishing you it's the

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,259
first thing I would have thought so

44
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,570
moving on to what I'm actually talking

45
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,729
about today and let me talk about a

46
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,589
brief history of phone hacking before

47
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,229
VoIP was a thing because phone hacking

48
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,700
is not new and depending on your

49
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,429
generation and how long you've been in

50
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,810
in tech for you you probably know some

51
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,090
of this already but I'm willing to bet

52
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,759
at least a decent proportion of people

53
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,979
in here and not aware of this I'm going

54
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,439
to recap the basic tech principles of

55
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,720
VoIP systems you may know it you may not

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,959
and then we'll talk about some of the

57
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,590
common attack vectors for voice now this

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,780
is the moment of

59
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,959
truth to see if the sound started

60
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,300
working I'm going to show you a clip

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,390
that you have probably almost definitely

62
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,739
seen before but we'll see if we get

63
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,738
sound or not you're gonna watch

64
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:51,110

No Oh

80
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,989
oh there we go hello yeah so um if you

81
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,910
haven't seen that clip before I'm sure a

82
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,740
lot of people have seen more games if

83
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,730
you haven't of course that's Matthew

84
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,100
Broderick trying to do actually do some

85
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,210
phone hacking now in fact um you may or

86
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,100
may not know that is completely

87
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,520
unrealistic unsurprisingly for a movie

88
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,650
in fact in that would not have been

89
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,669
possible in the 1980s it would have been

90
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:57,429
possible in the 60s essentially

91
00:05:53,670 --> 00:06:00,340
payphones in the u.s. anyway the dial

92
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,320
tone it was always dial tone first for

93
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,150
emergency calling so you wouldn't have

94
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,070
had to do that to get a dial tone and

95
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,750
there's a very big long write-up of that

96
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,250
there's so much critique of that clip

97
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,940
online on YouTube I'm not gonna

98
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,520
regurgitate it all but suffice to say

99
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,620
you could do that but not in the 80s and

100
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,359
definitely not now but you know it's

101
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,430
still it's still a thing that we talked

102
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,320
about is phone hacking and I like that

103
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,780
clip it's not gonna start again as it

104
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,580
keep going thank you so let's talk about

105
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,250
phone hacking and the history of phone

106
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,229
hacking the first phone hack arguably

107
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,290
what was the first hack ever was at in

108
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,180
1903 which was the telegram it was done

109
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,350
by this magician in the UK called

110
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,840
Neville a mask

111
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,190
maskull line I've been practicing saying

112
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,820
that name can't do it

113
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:48,250
so Marconi who of course is very very

114
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,830
famous made a lot of money from painting

115
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,750
telegram technology actually managed to

116
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,719
intercept signals when he was doing a

117
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,000
demo and actually started joking around

118
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,820
he started putting the word rats into

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,040
the signal and then started actually

120
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:05,230
doing like little ditties and was saying

121
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,300
there was a young fellow of Italy who

122
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,370
diddled the public quite prettily and

123
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,880
then was doing Shakespearean and things

124
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:15,880
like that so Marconi unsurprisingly

125
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,620
wasn't very happy and he didn't know

126
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,710
where it was coming from he was furious

127
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:24,720
and it actually turns out that four days

128
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:27,549
later this chap Neville he actually

129
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,960
confessed in the times because of course

130
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:34,000
this was 1900 so this was the read or

131
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,760
the Twitter of that day and confessed

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,040
that he had done it

133
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,310
his he justified his actions saying was

134
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:44,690
for the public good so this may sound

135
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,370
familiar but a hundred years ago and

136
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:50,520
some people said he was a hooligan some

137
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,230
and it was scientific hooliganism and it

138
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,859
was an outrage

139
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:58,470
but of course in fact he was trying to

140
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,480
disclose he was trying to disclose and

141
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,330
prove that Marconi's invention wasn't

142
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,540
100% secure which was some one of the

143
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:11,460
claims he was making it actually turned

144
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:14,010
out that Maskelyne was paid to do this

145
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,109
by the east and telegraph company who

146
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:19,680
weren't very happy that Marconi's

147
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:22,170
Wireless was basically going to ruin all

148
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,900
the investment they'd made in telegraph

149
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:29,310
poles so there you go we don't really

150
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:30,539
change very much to race it's actually

151
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,580
really cool there's lots of other

152
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,430
stories that are similar um so that's

153
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,800
kind of where the very very very early

154
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:40,140
days of phone hacking then I think we

155
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,959
skip a little bit of course I could talk

156
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,120
here about enigma and decoding but I'm

157
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,760
not going to I think that's very well

158
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,410
known and it is intercepting signals so

159
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,300
we could argue it was phone hacking but

160
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,400
I want to go a little bit further than

161
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,729
that and talk about freaking now

162
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,560
freaking really started in the 50s freak

163
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,010
apparently comes from phone-free and

164
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:08,609
freak I still feel like possibly it

165
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:11,430
should be spell f @p f ph r ee k just my

166
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,530
take but there we go and it began when

167
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,920
people realize that they could recreate

168
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,900
the the exact pitch of the phone routing

169
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,479
signal now the phone routing signal is

170
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,970
different now but at the time you could

171
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,770
I mean typically free-cos were just

172
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,780
using these things to make phone calls

173
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,939
and some people use them for

174
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,069
eavesdropping but yeah I don't know why

175
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,470
but I just put like Barney and telephone

176
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:38,160
sorry like some of these I I feel like

177
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,720
my my gif and mean game is like not as

178
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,730
strong as usual in these slides I don't

179
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,560
know there's there's less phone related

180
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:48,300
gifts out there who knew so there you go

181
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,319
I wanted to put some fun facts in about

182
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,400
freaking

183
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,980
some people can whistle in a perfect

184
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,900
twenty six hundred megahertz pitch I

185
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:01,110
have a video of it which might work

186
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,670
hopefully and there was a whistle that

187
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,130
they gave away in packets of Captain

188
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,500
Crunch the you could actually it would

189
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,439
actually admit the right pitch so

190
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,210
seriously and so people could do

191
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,630
freaking with a freebie out of Captain

192
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,920
Crunch there you go a lot of if you if

193
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,840
you're familiar with freaking and this

194
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,280
was the first thing I were aware of some

195
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,340
people actually made something called a

196
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,140
blue box which was a really common way

197
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,930
for people to manipulate things and both

198
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,430
Steve Jobs and and was they made blue

199
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,870
box boxes at college

200
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,189
they're quite well known for having done

201
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:37,770
that it kind of freaking kind of dropped

202
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,800
out of fashion Wow he couldn't really do

203
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,420
it when signaling became out-of-band as

204
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,370
in it was actually separated from the

205
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,640
main voice signal because you couldn't

206
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,890
send signals down the phone line that

207
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,540
were part of the signaling so it kind of

208
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,030
stopped in the 80s but yeah there's a

209
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,880
nicer Captain Crunch whistle so if you

210
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,069
do have some really old phones maybe you

211
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,710
can play around with it interestingly

212
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,650
let's see if this works

213
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:08,580
I apologize for the bad quality of this

214
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:11,100
clip I like could not is it gonna go I

215
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,760
couldn't find anything better but it's

216
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,760
more about the sound

217
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,079
if you had perfect pics like blind phone

218
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:44,589
freak Jill and Gracia you could whistle

219
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:46,899
calls through the network even shown off

220
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:49,480
his skills for the local media there's

221
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:53,110
one phone to a town in Illinois and back

222
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,570
to so there you go that's Jaron Gracia

223
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,540
who could actually whistle a perfect

224
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:02,320
pitch it's a cool party trick I think it

225
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,050
doesn't work anymore but it's cool right

226
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:10,000
and yes sorry for the the sorry if that

227
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:11,410
hurt people's ears but if anyone if

228
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,440
anyone could do that like please come

229
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,209
show me afterwards so real quick I don't

230
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,860
know who here has worked with VoIP as I

231
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,209
said I've spent a lot of time with VoIP

232
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,279
I'm pretty sure it's Stockholm Syndrome

233
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:23,560
but I'm still very fond of it if you

234
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,529
don't have VoIP works moving on to more

235
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,959
modern phones a quick 101 is you have an

236
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:30,819
IP Phone and IP Phone will talk to and

237
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,839
I've put call manager up here because I

238
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:34,149
used to work with a lot of Cisco

239
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,630
products but any kind of other phone

240
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:40,329
manager phone phone servers it will

241
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,819
signal when it can't do anything these

242
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:45,189
IP phones are really stupid like they

243
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:47,469
can't do anything by themselves so an IP

244
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,060
phone will talk to the call manager or

245
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,899
whatever call server it is it will say

246
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,939
hello what do I do

247
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:54,940
the call manager will tell it what to do

248
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,440
and then it will call another phone so

249
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,089
it will say someone's just out this

250
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,220
number what do I do with it the call

251
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:02,319
manager will then give the IP of the

252
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,149
other phone it will basically resolve

253
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:06,819
the phone number to an IP address and

254
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:09,519
then the voice stream will go in between

255
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:11,800
the voice stream never goes up to the

256
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,529
server the server just our signaling and

257
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,839
tells the phone's what to do so it's

258
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:19,030
actually very straightforward

259
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,070
next a slightly different one we're

260
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,439
going out to the ordinary phone Network

261
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,840
an IP Phone if it wants to call a phone

262
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,730
that is outside the VoIP system it will

263
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,620
talk to the call manager server again it

264
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,720
will say I don't know where this cook

265
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,780
this number goes to call manager says ah

266
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,230
that goes externally it will go to your

267
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:41,949
router or a voice gateway and then it

268
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:44,470
goes to your phone and it flows so

269
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,330
that's real real quick how this works oh

270
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,740
and the router I realized like when I

271
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,060
was doing this for the router does also

272
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,550
actually talk to the call manager so

273
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,869
yeah and some point providers we've

274
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,150
known and loved this thing's like broad

275
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:58,120
saw Cisco Avaya Mitel all kinds of

276
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,560
things so I'm not going into those but

277
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,750
I'm sure you must have worked with some

278
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,670
of those at some point so I just wanted

279
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,960
to talk briefly because I realized my

280
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:08,319
videos have taken too long and I just

281
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:11,200
got the 5-minute signal to have about

282
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,000
some of the attacks VLAN hopping this is

283
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,700
a classic VoIP attack it requires

284
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,280
physical access to the network you're

285
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,170
going and basically you just need to

286
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,850
identify the voice VLAN number and then

287
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,010
you start sending traffic into it this

288
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,230
allows you to eavesdrop on calls I've

289
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,970
done this one before it basically

290
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,590
requires you to physically secure your

291
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,880
network you know hard-coding MAC

292
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,430
addresses I know that's an awful thing

293
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,040
to do but in theory it does stop this

294
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:39,640
attack firewalling off phones and public

295
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:44,260
areas etc again struggling for phone

296
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,790
related gifts here so DDoS DDoS of

297
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,710
course we can do with phones actually

298
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,699
known as T dos telephone telephony

299
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:54,160
denial of service a guy who was ma an

300
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,350
iOS bug bounty hunter managed to tdawg91

301
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,260
one in several cities a few years ago

302
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,760
complete accident but quite bad of

303
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:06,370
course the you know you don't want to

304
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:08,740
Tito snow maman not anywhere yeah I mean

305
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:11,020
it's um attacking DNS service is always

306
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,740
good for voice because VoIP needs to

307
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:16,600
resolve to avoid needs to resolve to DNS

308
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,880
and then of course there's war dialling

309
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,030
where you use machines to just go

310
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,920
through every single phone number I mean

311
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:27,010
that's a little bit slow it's not always

312
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,660
considered DDoS but and I'm sure you've

313
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,310
seen that on wargames and other movies

314
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,170
again I was

315
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,779
so we're going to go for overflowing

316
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,519
beer because why not what was

317
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:38,410
interesting was after nine one one was

318
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,329
DDoS there a lot which was by accident

319
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,160
there were actually a lot of copycat

320
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:44,949
attacks of people doing it again and

321
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,749
again on purpose which is really really

322
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:50,079
sick for nine and like for the emergency

323
00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:52,059
services it's not cool but um VoIP

324
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:56,079
protocols as you probably know if you've

325
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:59,050
done any kind of like eavesdropping or

326
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,638
like pcap on networks with this VoIP

327
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:04,930
protocols are often in the clear

328
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:07,689
by default sip RTP HT to three mgcp

329
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,199
skinny most of these do have a secure

330
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:12,579
version but often it requires you to uh

331
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,229
to at least have a certificate on every

332
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:15,998
single phone and people don't want to do

333
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:17,470
it in general because it's difficult so

334
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:22,779
you will often find these things are in

335
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:24,550
the clear so I mean Mike I mean it's bad

336
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:27,339
but this is when they were developed it

337
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:30,309
wasn't a thing next thing we talk about

338
00:16:27,339 --> 00:16:32,139
is toll fraud toll fraud and I'm really

339
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:35,050
sorry if there was anybody in here from

340
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:38,500
any of these countries I am NOT trying

341
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:40,000
to have a pop at your country but the

342
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,250
top five country is apparently at the

343
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,649
moment took call using toll fraud our

344
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,800
Cuba Somalia Bosnia and Herzegovina

345
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:50,889
Estonia and Latvia so what people do is

346
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,050
they will chain typically users or the

347
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:56,620
configuration of a system to basically

348
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:58,209
do long-distance calls for cheap so I

349
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,449
actually saw an example in a phone

350
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:03,609
system I worked with where the someone

351
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:06,069
got into the phone system did a call

352
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,510
forward all to international numbers

353
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,849
which should have been blocked but

354
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:13,059
wasn't and so they would call the local

355
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:16,240
number and then from their mobile and

356
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:18,730
then the actual companies call system

357
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,209
phone system would pick up the bill for

358
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:23,530
the long-distance call smart but it

359
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,709
should have been stopped with correct

360
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,629
configuration so you know bit of yeah

361
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,610
bit of fraud

362
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,770
um this makes me sad because I was going

363
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,870
to give our chocolate fish here in New

364
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,490
Zealand where I've spent a significant

365
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,229
amount of my time living we have

366
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,899
chocolate marshmallow fish and it's for

367
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,970
fishing they didn't turn up before I

368
00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:45,110
left Australia so I do have koalas

369
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,850
not gonna be able to throw them because

370
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,370
it's too dark so if you want chocolate

371
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,750
and stickers just come see me at the end

372
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,189
voice phishing of course is a thing if

373
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,169
there's anyone in here who hasn't been

374
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,940
called by scammer from somewhere in the

375
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:56,960
world then I don't know what's wrong

376
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,240
with you because that happens all the

377
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,950
time I felt like I needed to mention it

378
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,260
for completeness I'm not really gonna

379
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,169
talk about it because everyone knows

380
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,299
about it contact centers are interesting

381
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:10,159
contact centers use something called IVR

382
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:13,220
that that's the script interactive voice

383
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:15,470
response I know it's not at all annoying

384
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,289
but in fact those applications can

385
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,909
handle really sensitive information and

386
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:21,919
so you may have been transferred by a

387
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:22,610
call center agent to put in your PIN or

388
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,440
something like that

389
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,168
if those applications aren't configured

390
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,750
properly that information can be stolen

391
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:31,669
and if it isn't cleared away so if

392
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,900
you're ever developing IVR applications

393
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:34,900
keep that in mind

394
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:40,340
ss7 hacking ss7 is the signaling that's

395
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:44,629
used throughout the PSTN Network the

396
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:48,470
public network hacking team in 2014 they

397
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:51,080
they of course came to prevalence when

398
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:53,570
they found out that they were using ss7

399
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,449
vulnerabilities - for their for their

400
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,039
products and you know we said they were

401
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:01,970
basically selling it to particularly

402
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:03,200
brutal regimes not great I know this is

403
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,860
just my favorite I try and get it in

404
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,210
everything voicemail is super insecure

405
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,949
it's often one of the first things

406
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:15,559
attackers will look for Clippy is on

407
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:17,570
this but slide for no reason and the

408
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:19,700
British celebrity voicemail hacking you

409
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:22,250
might remember this we called it hacking

410
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,049
it wasn't really hacking it was it was

411
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,929
basically journalists manipulating

412
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:30,980
default pins to get into celebrities and

413
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:33,260
other people's voicemails the most sad

414
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,880
thing about this was you may or may not

415
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,530
be aware that they actually broke into

416
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,590
the voicemail of a teenager who was

417
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,210
murdered and because they access to her

418
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,908
voicemails her parents thought she was

419
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,980
still alive which is obviously awful so

420
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,140
but that's what that was about they

421
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,760
didn't really do hacking they just well

422
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,929
arguably it depends if you want to call

423
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,970
it hacking or not they were basically

424
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:56,210
exploiting default pins in voicemail

425
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,350
boxes but very sad people went to jail

426
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,809
and rightly so

427
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,909
I think so I've gone through this at

428
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:03,980
speed because I completely missed on my

429
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,990
timings but wise boy still important

430
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,520
I'll put all these up on the screen VoIP

431
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,929
technology still exists behind the

432
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,950
scenes we're all going to saw froze

433
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:12,770
we're going to teams we're going to

434
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,570
slack but VoIP is still behind there at

435
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,889
least carrying your audio so you can

436
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,110
find this in all your collaboration

437
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,460
technology so have a look it might be

438
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,428
something you want to incorporate into

439
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,770
your pen testing risk assessment etc you

440
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:29,169
might still be using SMS for FMF a

441
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:31,158
please stop that I think it's broken and

442
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:32,900
understanding how things work is always

443
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:34,789
good and I don't think we talk about

444
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:39,440
VoIP enough and I'm very very fond of it

445
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:41,539
so yeah and this is my take a photo for

446
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,880
link slide there's a couple of

447
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:45,500
interesting articles up there that I was

448
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,080
reading and using to create this

449
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,940
presentation I will leave this up

450
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,470
definitely watch the video there in the

451
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:56,299
middle which is how phone phreaking work

452
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:58,850
by the 8-bit guy super cool and yeah I

453
00:20:56,299 --> 00:21:00,740
think I'm about up for time so I'm gonna

454
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:03,260
leave it there thank you for listening I

455
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:06,320
hope that was just a little Whistlestop

456
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,908
tour of wipe stuff and I think we have a

457
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,770
bit of a gap so I'll stay here give out

458
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:11,539
stickers give you chocolate I have like

459
