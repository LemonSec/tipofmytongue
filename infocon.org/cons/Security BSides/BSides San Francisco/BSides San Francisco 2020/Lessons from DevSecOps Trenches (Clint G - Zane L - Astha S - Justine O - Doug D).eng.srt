1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
hey everyone thank you so much for

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,210
coming today I'm excited to be joined by

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,068
several esteemed friends and colleagues

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,679
and we're going to be talking about

5
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,660
various things that have been successful

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,309
at various types of companies in terms

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,389
of scaling their security efforts so

8
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:17,490
we're going to talk about some things

9
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,859
that we're great some things that were

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,299
less so and we're going to spend a lot

11
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,890
of time in the middle of perhaps 20 to

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,019
30 minutes or so answering questions

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,099
because we want to make sure that we're

14
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,889
speaking about the topics most

15
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:33,300
immediately pressing to you so if you go

16
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,500
to SLI do you should be able to pose

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,559
some questions which we'll be able to

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,480
see and vote on together okay so before

19
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,070
we get into it let's just introduce

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,180
ourselves a little bit Zain do you wanna

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,390
go first sure

22
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,960
hey I'm Sam Lackey I'm a co-founder and

23
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:53,579
C so at signal Sciences and previously -

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,680
thank you and part of that as the CEO at

25
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,780
Etsy built and ran the security program

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,469
they are kind of at the start of the

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:05,040
DevOps shift hi everybody I'm Justine

28
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:08,220
Osborne I am a manager of an offensive

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,860
security team at Apple I've been a

30
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,200
breaker of things for most of my career

31
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,590
a security consultant for most of my

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,770
career at NCC and AIESEC partners and

33
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:21,720
yeah now doing Apple

34
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,600
I'm Doug Perry I'm currently the

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,340
director of defense at data dawg

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,860
it's relatively recent change prior to

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,299
that I was director of product security

38
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,000
also my backgrounds mostly in offensive

39
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:37,049
security at Yahoo as well as NCC and I

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,670
second hi everyone I'm aster you

41
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,229
probably saw me running around all

42
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,329
throughout the conference and if you're

43
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,210
a speaker you probably got lots of spam

44
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,429
from me so thank everyone for coming my

45
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,820
day job is I lead application security

46
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,860
at Netflix that includes sort of

47
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,020
engineering facing security partnerships

48
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,119
as well as there

49
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,240
like engineering related things that we

50
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,159
do to scale ourselves as a function and

51
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,689
outside of that I helped organize this

52
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,719
amazing conference and thank you all for

53
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,719
coming

54
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:12,109
right and my name is Clint Gibbler I'm a

55
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,910
technical director and research director

56
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,860
at NCC group so we do security

57
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,900
consulting for all the things mostly

58
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,209
penetration testing but we're also doing

59
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,739
more as strategic advising on security

60
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:23,629
automation and DevOps and stuff like

61
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:26,090
that another thing I wanted to mention

62
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:29,239
before we get into it is all of us are

63
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,500
good friends but I we're gonna purposely

64
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,030
try to find some things to disagree

65
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,730
about because we find panels where

66
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,049
everyone's a green very boring so and

67
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,700
also when people disagree I think that

68
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:39,950
shows you the nice like edges around

69
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,480
where like a specific saying company

70
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,069
culture or background may make something

71
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,190
a great idea one place and not as much

72
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,660
in another so you know we disagree

73
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:52,239
strongly we're not going to fight

74
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:56,209
afterwards at least not about that so

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,069
okay so one thing that I think is

76
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,019
interesting is many companies are giving

77
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,310
talks about hey here's this cool thing

78
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,620
we did and we hear lots of success

79
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,109
stories but I think the failure stories

80
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,329
is also very interesting you know

81
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:09,950
because mistakes are made things don't

82
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:11,840
go as planned so I'm curious if you

83
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,940
could share share some things that you

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,750
put a non-trivial amount of time into

85
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:20,870
that didn't go very well or at least as

86
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:26,720
expected yeah and this is open for

87
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:29,329
anyone well I can start with most here

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,209
this was actually not at Apple but at a

89
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:36,620
different company I worked at square and

90
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:41,959
I attempted as my first project to

91
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:44,569
create a dynamic analyzer and that I put

92
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:49,040
a lot of time and effort into and ran it

93
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:54,768
first time and managed to crash pager

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,720
duty well toss them essentially and so

95
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:58,970
yeah it was a it was a it was a huge

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,760
learning experience about how your

97
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:04,040
script that you run on your laptop is

98
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,149
it's gonna behave quite differently when

99
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,980
you're running it in a real production

100
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,900
environment and you really have to think

101
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,549
about a lot of things and a lot of

102
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,550
consequences to the things that you're

103
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,650
building and I think also as a security

104
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,510
team you don't really want that to be

105
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,220
the first introduction to a tool that

106
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,930
you wrote it doesn't give people a lot

107
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,390
of confidence in using it in the future

108
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,760
so a real lesson learned there to really

109
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,960
think about the actual operation of the

110
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:33,200
tools that you're building and

111
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:36,380
delivering to the organization yeah back

112
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,080
in NC days we spent my apps like team

113
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,900
and I spent close to a year trying to

114
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,789
really bring in both SAST and DAST

115
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,070
static analysis and dynamic scanning

116
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:50,360
tool him that was a year of my life I

117
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:51,950
will never get back to put it mildly

118
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,280
but I'm sure whisky companies were very

119
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:57,950
happily they're very happy about that

120
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,340
it was a near complete disaster on both

121
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:03,979
fronts of really trying to have trying

122
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,890
to adapt sass join in - coin that was

123
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,930
written for very much the waterfall era

124
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:13,940
of applications not being that

125
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:15,530
feature-rich being very server-side

126
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,660
heavy so not really any client-side

127
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,340
functionality or anything like that we

128
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,650
really said like look you know these

129
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,419
have been common tools of any app sect

130
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,870
program is always you know talk about

131
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,220
app sec you talk about sass and DAST

132
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,490
something we had to learn very painfully

133
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,600
and now I've seen a merge across

134
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,870
virtually all of the forward-leaning

135
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,460
organizations is that those using those

136
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,430
sort of controls has either changed

137
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,650
radically or gone almost entirely out

138
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,930
the window as a result as you've really

139
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,969
gone into a environment where your

140
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,490
development teams are moving faster and

141
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,050
faster and faster and faster so we can

142
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,320
deep dive into what that means later on

143
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:57,400
but I'll do that as a short high-level

144
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,400
spectacular year long train wreck

145
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,719
yeah plus one on that investment in

146
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,849
static analysis where we did spend a

147
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,320
bunch of time on so we're a polyglot

148
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,330
environment so we did spend a bunch of

149
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,830
time getting the tooling built up and

150
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,099
getting some of these tools running and

151
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,139
then the ROI was just not there for us I

152
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,850
think we hit a new record for speed of

153
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:22,240
which we started to trash static

154
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:27,120
analysis yeah so one thing I think this

155
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,460
was maybe two wraps at Kelly's ago Scott

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,780
Scott Behrens on the Netflix team one of

157
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,820
the things they mentioned that I thought

158
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,369
was very interesting is they spent a lot

159
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,620
of time thinking about or building this

160
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,210
thing out without clear sort of success

161
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,280
criteria and metrics and one of the

162
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,930
lessons learned he said was that after

163
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,448
say five or six months of working on

164
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,190
something they then said like oh like

165
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,870
are we done we're not getting the

166
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,389
results we want but do we keep pushing

167
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,889
forward or do we stop and so now he said

168
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,570
because of that lesson they now spend

169
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,060
more time thinking upfront like how do

170
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,099
we know when this is a success and when

171
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,979
we should pull the plug and I thought

172
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:05,190
that the comment was very insightful

173
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:07,570
definitely allows us to fail faster yeah

174
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,550
so another topic that I think is

175
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,940
interesting I hear various people talk

176
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,710
about and blog posts and talks is asset

177
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:16,389
inventory sort of this idea of

178
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,270
understanding your environment whether

179
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:22,210
it's what's in code how code goes from

180
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,740
to production what your cloud

181
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,090
environment looks like your employee

182
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,990
devices things like that it sort of

183
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,880
means different things to different

184
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,199
people but I think overall asset

185
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,210
inventory means sort of like what do you

186
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,849
have and how are they talking or how are

187
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:37,719
they connected so one thing that I'm

188
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:40,599
curious about is I guess if you were to

189
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,070
start embarking on the path relatively

190
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:43,599
from scratch trying to get an idea of

191
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,759
your environment in a very you know

192
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,460
constantly changing environment in many

193
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,990
cases like what would you do and in your

194
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,020
work doing this has there been anything

195
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,599
surprising or interesting any gotchas

196
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,669
maybe to look out for yeah I think one

197
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,889
of the things that we realized that as

198
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:02,469
we started doing sort of solving this

199
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:05,110
problem of acid inventory was you don't

200
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,490
need just security engineers to build

201
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,710
you an acid

202
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,599
even if they are sort of software focus

203
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,789
security engineers you actually need

204
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,310
data engineering expertise so you are

205
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:17,770
building those systems to properly scale

206
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,840
if you do have a pretty big environment

207
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,729
where you're gonna end up dating that so

208
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,440
for us the first version of our asset

209
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:26,770
inventory which was built by the apps

210
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,630
act team basically got to a point where

211
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,210
we weren't able to scale it anymore and

212
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:34,390
the work were now doing with our data

213
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,909
engineering partners is what is kind of

214
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,069
setting us up for not just solving

215
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,539
abstract problems with the asset

216
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,750
inventory but other use cases like

217
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,420
Incident Response and you know even

218
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,100
outside of security related to running

219
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,680
migration campaigns and things like that

220
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:56,649
for our productivity engineering

221
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:58,719
partners yeah let's say one other thing

222
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:01,230
we learned on the asset inventory side

223
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,279
so not on the technical side but on the

224
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,750
organizational side how you can get I

225
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,450
can start to get some asset inventory

226
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,500
set up is sending security whatever you

227
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,310
want to call it business partners or

228
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,959
champions or anything like that to

229
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,949
meetings with the product teams and the

230
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,290
meetings with the kind of build

231
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,370
infrastructure teams and just don't have

232
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,930
them object to anything they're not

233
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,339
there for a security review they're not

234
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,819
there for any of that their job is just

235
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:25,899
to sit in the back and listen and find

236
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,779
what are new products that are coming

237
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:30,760
out that you didn't what just weren't on

238
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:32,860
your radar at all because you you win

239
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,260
two for one with that you find out first

240
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,000
of all what's a new you know feature or

241
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,560
product or anything like that that's

242
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,360
coming out that now you can actually put

243
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,069
through a security review but then also

244
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,279
you can find out where did something

245
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,820
break down in your pipeline in essence

246
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,279
of not finding out about this and adjust

247
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,170
where you want to plug in whether that's

248
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,630
on the technical sense or organizational

249
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,550
sense to find out about hey there's a

250
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,470
whole new initiative going on in a

251
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,149
second cloud provider that we knew

252
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,620
nothing about okay

253
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:04,089
what could we have done to discover this

254
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,649
earlier rather than at the product

255
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,990
meeting that's discussing the press

256
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:09,820
release going live next week like that

257
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,180
which i think is happened to all of us

258
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,180
problem

259
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:18,550
yeah so something someone submitted

260
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,010
which was actually already on my list of

261
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,599
things I wanted to ask is how do you

262
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,100
think about the build versus buy

263
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,280
decision sort of what are your criteria

264
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:30,520
and when when would you do one or the

265
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:34,630
other I'll kick this one off there's a

266
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:36,250
lot of variables there including I mean

267
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,450
like cost and budget of course you know

268
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,190
that's kind of the obvious one but it's

269
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,310
also you know the amount of resources

270
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,420
you have to devote to that sort of thing

271
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,410
you know how long it might take them to

272
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,180
build that you know whether you're

273
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,310
working with you know full-time

274
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,020
developers or security folks who are

275
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,390
good at writing Python or something

276
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:55,120
along those lines right I think a big

277
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,680
one for me too is that at least in my

278
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,960
experience the security teams that I've

279
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,000
been on and very much the work has been

280
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,070
very much interrupt-driven and so even

281
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,450
though you have a you know it looks like

282
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,770
you've got a full quarter to play with

283
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,330
it actually ends up with being like two

284
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,189
weeks that you can devote to spending

285
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,170
time to write this thing and depending

286
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,340
on what that thing is that's not nearly

287
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,599
enough time and then that's gonna be

288
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,360
like this project that you just like

289
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,500
dragged along quarter after quarter and

290
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,090
you never really complete to your

291
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,000
satisfaction and so you have to be

292
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:25,210
really I think aware of what your

293
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,430
inbound interrupts are going to be and

294
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,560
obviously like by you know by definition

295
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:32,079
you don't always know that but I would

296
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,739
just say to be as realistic as possible

297
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,330
with that one thing that we try to

298
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,430
leverage whenever we're making a bit

299
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,460
versus by decision is something called

300
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:44,530
decision logs that we do internally that

301
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,050
helps with that where you're actually

302
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,250
kind of being very explicit about all

303
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,680
the different great here you consider

304
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,030
the different options and why you

305
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,250
decided to go in a particular direction

306
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:57,310
so that in the future if you ever have

307
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,960
to revisit that decision you know you

308
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,660
can you you can look at like what has

309
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,810
potentially changed and the other thing

310
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,370
is also sometimes based on the Wender

311
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:08,890
you're working with sometimes it's also

312
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,500
possible for you to say okay if you can

313
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,819
only do 50% of what I need is your

314
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,760
product going in the same direction

315
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,680
where I want to go so getting that 50%

316
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,290
from you today is going to be better

317
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,540
than

318
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,669
me riding from zero so I think keeping

319
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,349
those things in account and making that

320
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:28,999
a part of the decision process is very

321
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,949
important yeah on that I give up

322
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:33,019
complete 180 that I've done in my career

323
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:35,978
on this one of starting out coming from

324
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:38,989
Penta side to building a security team

325
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:40,549
scaling that we're I think when you come

326
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:42,589
from the Penta side it's very easy to

327
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:44,329
think about how oh every product you've

328
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:45,799
ever you've ever looked at you've always

329
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:47,449
found some edge case that you know

330
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,649
you've found a vulnerability in it or

331
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:51,319
something like that nothing's perfect

332
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,359
why would I deploy any of that and then

333
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:56,238
you have this magical career experience

334
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:57,259
which is actually going to defense where

335
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:59,869
you learn that

336
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:02,269
hey for most of these areas we have 0%

337
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:04,759
coverage on that and if I can get a tool

338
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:06,949
that I can drop in that gives me 50%

339
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,649
coverage or 80% coverage or something

340
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:11,299
like that and then my team is gonna have

341
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:14,359
to build on top to get that remaining

342
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:16,819
20% I will do that every time now right

343
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:18,889
by my goal in scaling a security

344
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:21,469
organization is getting to that 80%

345
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:24,109
coverage across as many areas as fast as

346
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:26,089
possible so that when you do want to

347
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:29,179
build or if you even have the resources

348
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:31,220
to build which many teams do not it's

349
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:33,919
for that incremental bit rather than for

350
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,889
the foundational piece of all these but

351
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,029
had to learn that one the hard way yeah

352
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:39,859
so just to make that a little more

353
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:42,529
concrete can you just list maybe two or

354
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:44,989
three things that you and not like

355
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:47,600
vendor but just like category like thing

356
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:49,069
you bought and thing you decided to

357
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,749
build just to make it more concrete

358
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:52,219
because I think the decision criteria is

359
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:57,079
useful too but just like having some

360
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:59,720
anecdotal examples try do that without

361
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:06,099
mentioning my own company now because

362
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:06,100
that's what we did a few areas in the

363
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,659
endpoint side of things there's a good

364
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:14,959
example like building what then became a

365
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:17,499
West query but building on that side on

366
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,819
the the endpoint side of things where

367
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:20,989
honestly we probably should have bought

368
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:23,059
is a little bit tougher because this was

369
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:25,129
10 years ago and no one had go to OS 10

370
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:26,749
support for anything but that I think

371
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:28,400
that was a good example of I see a lot

372
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:30,650
of security teams today

373
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,689
kind of trying to invent their own sim

374
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,920
or invent their own end point things or

375
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,140
anything like that

376
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,610
and thinking hey how can we build on top

377
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,370
of some technology that's there to

378
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,630
customize for what we want on the app

379
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,610
SEC side of things there is a lot that

380
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,230
that we really did they're building on

381
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,700
both static analysis side because that

382
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,110
wasn't working and then really the

383
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,560
laughs and protection side which then

384
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:54,140
became signal sciences but yeah there's

385
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,069
certainly no like two-factor off ones or

386
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,810
anything like that which I've certainly

387
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,730
seen security teams try to build their

388
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:01,430
own sort of authentication services or

389
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,660
anything there let's let's not try to

390
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,300
maintain that ourselves and build that

391
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,819
ourselves I was gonna say account

392
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,589
takeover detection was the thing that we

393
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,200
were looking at and and we looked at a

394
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:13,610
few different vendors and a little we're

395
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,500
having this conversation we're trying to

396
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,180
figure out you know it's just some

397
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,029
JavaScript and the backend thing like

398
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,469
probably do that ourselves and then we

399
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,970
went to a local meetup and I think it

400
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,440
was someone from Etsy I forget I forget

401
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,820
their name but talked about how they

402
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,920
like built this thing over the course of

403
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,700
a year and a half I mean this ISA look

404
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,870
to each other they were like well I

405
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,440
guess we made the right decision to go

406
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:35,300
to buy that product right like it's you

407
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,620
know in and there was still like not as

408
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,300
many features as we would have liked you

409
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,860
know but it was great work don't get me

410
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,000
wrong but we're just not gonna invest

411
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,120
that much time in that one we could just

412
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,670
buy it yeah so in general if it's like

413
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,650
not core business function or not very

414
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,390
unique to your company would you say

415
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,890
that you would consider buying if the

416
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,540
price was reasonable yeah I mean I would

417
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,400
say if it if it fit like nothing's gonna

418
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,510
be one size fits all but for the

419
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,370
particular constraints that you're

420
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,140
operating under at your company at the

421
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,060
current time if this thing really fits

422
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,860
view then buy it and then something that

423
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,510
we've done like almost pretty

424
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,580
consistently over the although the

425
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,580
vendor products that we purchased is we

426
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,650
then write custom scripts plug-ins use

427
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,940
it in our own unique way and so we end

428
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,800
up with kind of like a hybrid thing

429
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,360
where we buy and then we build on top of

430
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,760
it we keep in touch with a company and

431
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,110
see if what they you know what we want

432
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,819
them to do is on their roadmap or not

433
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,670
it's always in the next sprint it's

434
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,279
never the next sprint I just wanna make

435
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,630
that clear but you know like so we kind

436
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,189
of end up with this you know but a

437
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,370
Frankenstein thing that works well for

438
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:37,100
us one thing I do want to call out there

439
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,610
is like keeping an openness to say that

440
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,430
if a year

441
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,810
now a vendor product will do the thing

442
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,140
that I needed to do being appointed

443
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,399
deprecating the thing you wrote yourself

444
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,620
internally if that's going to reduce the

445
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,959
pain of operations and maintenance and

446
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,720
things like that on your side I think

447
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:56,189
the maintenance of these things is the

448
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,050
thing that no one thinks about right

449
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,000
yeah oh yeah we can do this thing and

450
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,019
then but are you gonna maintain it until

451
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,519
you leave and then read all the

452
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,209
documentation so that someone else who's

453
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,949
on call can fix it if it breaks and yeah

454
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:10,620
yeah my answer was gonna be at dynamic

455
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:12,329
analysis I learned the hard way that if

456
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:14,458
you're not prepared to operate that at

457
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,349
any sort of scale it's gonna be a

458
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,720
massive failure and so sometimes it's

459
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:22,649
better to just to just buy in those

460
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,939
situations yeah so I guess along those

461
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,790
lines there's been a couple of questions

462
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:28,410
from the audience because there was some

463
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,418
earlier comments about challenges with

464
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,340
static analysis and dynamic analysis

465
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:37,440
tools so there's a sort of a series of

466
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:38,790
related questions you know like for

467
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,970
example like what sort of scanning do

468
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,950
you put into apps like pipelines you

469
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,380
know if not sassed then would or just

470
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,700
related things like that and I have some

471
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:57,990
thoughts on this but I figured I the

472
00:17:47,700 --> 00:18:02,340
offer it up first yeah so I guess okay

473
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:04,230
sure I'll start so an action I'm going

474
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,418
to be talking about this a little bit in

475
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:10,049
like not the next slot but the slot

476
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,700
after that in this room so I I will talk

477
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:13,230
about this in more detail but I think

478
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,929
one thing that I found very interesting

479
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,030
from a number of different companies is

480
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:20,190
there's a couple ways to think about it

481
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,950
right so you can think like are we

482
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,559
trying to find all the bugs or are we

483
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,669
trying to find are these security

484
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,280
controls and secure by default

485
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:31,740
frameworks we've built being used like

486
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,700
have you not disabled the protections

487
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,190
that we built for you

488
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,200
so in terms of the big like systemic

489
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,950
scalable systemic wins I've seen I'm

490
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,450
like learning from Austin and then a lot

491
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,070
of this I think comes from Zane's

492
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,330
blackhat talk a couple of years ago I'll

493
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,830
just shamelessly borrow from

494
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,080
it is that basically if you can build

495
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,089
this these nice guardrails this knife

496
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,239
nice paved road where developers can be

497
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:56,499
better faster and more secure and

498
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:58,719
everything's handled for them they don't

499
00:18:56,499 --> 00:19:01,239
have to think of all these risks and you

500
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:05,169
just then grep for like disable security

501
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:08,109
or dangerously set in HTML and react for

502
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:09,399
example so basically like you you've

503
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:11,499
handled all of these cases so that

504
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:13,508
rather than trying to find very complex

505
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:15,729
like interprocedural data flow analysis

506
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:17,169
type bugs you're instead saying oh we

507
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:17,889
built all these nice security controls

508
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:21,249
for over you

509
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:23,019
you can handle secrets you can do mutual

510
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:25,409
TLS between micro-services like all

511
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:28,289
these nice things we'd built for you and

512
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:30,789
then basically your checks are now for

513
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:32,589
not complicated vulnerabilities but just

514
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:34,479
are you not using the nice things we

515
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,158
built for you so that's one trend I've

516
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:38,440
seen across a number of companies that I

517
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,509
think is basically the other side of the

518
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,959
coin but I think is very powerful

519
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:46,479
because ultimately you you need to spend

520
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:48,369
time like triaging tool results and I

521
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:50,229
think there are cases where you do want

522
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:53,168
a deep like enter procedural data flow

523
00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:55,329
if you have like legacy C C++ code bases

524
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:59,139
and things like that but that's one

525
00:19:55,329 --> 00:20:00,789
interesting shift I've noticed one of

526
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:03,279
the things we realized doing some

527
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:06,070
internal analysis about a year and a

528
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:09,309
half ago was for a lot of the critical

529
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:12,218
vulnerabilities that we had found in the

530
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:13,959
previous year we realized that oh if

531
00:20:12,219 --> 00:20:16,929
some of our paved road controls were

532
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:19,029
adopted in those systems we would be

533
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:21,879
able to reduce the severity of greater

534
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:23,619
than 30% of those vulnerabilities so at

535
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:25,809
the end of the day that's why we're here

536
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:28,449
is to reduce a risk to the company right

537
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:30,969
so if we can reduce that risk by not

538
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:33,759
altogether preventing the vulnerability

539
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:36,759
but reducing the impact of it that's

540
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:40,419
definitely a worthwhile trade-off to

541
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:41,709
make I want to disagree with you a

542
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:45,639
little bit thank you

543
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:48,759
weave in agree no max no um so like and

544
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:50,889
I've I'm gonna disagree and also agree

545
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:54,159
so like I I agree that we that that

546
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:55,839
security should provide like tools and

547
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,610
like abstractions to make security

548
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,960
easier I mean

549
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,209
I've said that for a while I completely

550
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,160
agree with that approach but like the

551
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,840
other thing that we that security people

552
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,080
have said for a while is also like you

553
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,889
know educate empower you know like work

554
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,909
with your develop make sure they

555
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,650
understand security make sure they

556
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:15,309
understand the impact and I feel like we

557
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,780
abstract too much it could be bad in the

558
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:19,000
long run right because there may not

559
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,280
always be a tool or a framework or a

560
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,080
thing that they can use and then so you

561
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,360
should completely forget about security

562
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,470
the whole time you know like it's just

563
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,399
something I kind of like I've struggled

564
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:32,650
with personally yeah that's very you

565
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,059
you've sort of helped and coddled people

566
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,500
for so long that they don't realize it's

567
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:37,418
like a dangerous world out there so that

568
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,190
they maybe don't realize when they're

569
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:41,110
not using sort of a secure by default

570
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,130
framework that there's like 50 things

571
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,299
they need to care about that they've

572
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,490
never had to care about before right

573
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:47,290
yeah and it's like it's I mean obviously

574
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,210
I think the answer there is its balance

575
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,559
right but you know make it as easy it

576
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,240
may be if you make the secure thing to

577
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,490
do the easy thing to do you'll get a lot

578
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,929
more like uptake within your within your

579
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,090
organization don't you know don't just

580
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,160
drop the workflows don't slow things

581
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,899
down all that sort of thing but you know

582
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,150
I think it's just fine line so yeah

583
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,650
that's definitely agree with you that

584
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,630
that can be an issue and that is

585
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,600
something that we do an offensive

586
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:13,809
security is try to bring some of that

587
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,780
back and make sure that when we talk

588
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:18,010
about the engagements that we do that we

589
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,320
share that with as many people as

590
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:24,190
possible in the organization and that

591
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,409
gives them some perspective as to okay

592
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,120
that's that sort of minor vulnerability

593
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,860
that came up in my static analysis that

594
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,209
I didn't think was important now I see

595
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,409
how it's used in a chain of

596
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:35,110
vulnerabilities to reach something

597
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:40,990
really important and it can really

598
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:43,409
articulate it better for folks yeah sort

599
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,730
of along those lines Justine I think

600
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,110
sort of read teams as well as like

601
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,720
dedsec op teams they're sort of the most

602
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:53,770
hyped new teams recently so I guess for

603
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,240
you in your experience what is if a

604
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,918
company is starting or building a red

605
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,809
team what are some like key things to

606
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:01,210
make sure to do right or how do you make

607
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:03,280
sure that a red team isn't just finding

608
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,990
bugs that are you know maybe or maybe

609
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,399
not getting fixed but how do you make

610
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,559
sure the red team is like measurably

611
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,809
improving a company security posture and

612
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,849
like reducing risk

613
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:13,918
just sort of finding one off bugs yeah I

614
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,299
mean I think it's a hard problem that

615
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,049
I'll probably be working on for the rest

616
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:21,299
of my career but you know just measuring

617
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:22,859
security risk in general and and where

618
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,599
you're making an impact but I do think

619
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:28,289
that offensive security has a real

620
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:30,718
benefit there I think that in general

621
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:33,840
one of my colleagues always says

622
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:36,239
security testing is boils down to sixth

623
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,488
grade science it's you have a hypothesis

624
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:40,919
you do an experiment and then you

625
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:43,499
analyze the results and that's really

626
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,839
what I think most of security testing

627
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:48,269
should be and I think where we sometimes

628
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,070
get lost is what's our hypothesis and I

629
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:51,809
think our hypothesis is often the part

630
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,158
where we're not quite sure what we're

631
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:55,259
testing or what we're trying to get at

632
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,999
and I think being successful as a red

633
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:58,859
team is really looking at okay what are

634
00:23:56,999 --> 00:24:01,769
our hypotheses and do these actually

635
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:03,629
make sense for organization do we really

636
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:05,070
think that this type of threat is going

637
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:08,309
to affect us do we really think that

638
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:10,019
this you know we're worried about this

639
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:11,519
thing but it's very hard to exploit do

640
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,879
we really think that we should focus on

641
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,279
that

642
00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:15,689
and so we have a hypothesis that we

643
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,409
think these are the things than a bad

644
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:26,279
guys good or bad actor is going to do

645
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:28,200
and and so if then we run our experiment

646
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,259
and the cool thing about red teams is

647
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:34,559
that they're run on the real running

648
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:36,869
live systems in production and that is

649
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,908
something that I think is really fits in

650
00:24:36,869 --> 00:24:40,918
well with our new world of DevOps and

651
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:43,379
agile and all of this because it's

652
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,259
impossible to do the old method of let's

653
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:48,478
test everything before it goes out and

654
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:50,279
so red teams give you a chance to kind

655
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:52,139
of see the bigger picture and so you're

656
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:55,289
doing all these little things throughout

657
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:57,928
your development lifecycle to make sure

658
00:24:55,289 --> 00:25:00,299
that you're doing you know secure coding

659
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:02,849
and you've got kind of the frameworks in

660
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:04,639
use that you need and everything but

661
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:06,809
there's things that we there's always

662
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:09,178
loopholes there's always things that you

663
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,950
didn't think about and I think that red

664
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:13,739
team's also really bring in the

665
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,809
operational side of security so we often

666
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:18,389
if we're focused mostly on apps X

667
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:20,879
sometimes it's easy to forget about the

668
00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:22,350
things that are corporate infrastructure

669
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:25,020
that's actually running the

670
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:28,010
things that we that we're developing is

671
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,940
sometimes where it all falls down so um

672
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:33,690
not sure if I fully answered the

673
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:37,020
question but yeah cool yeah thank you

674
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:39,780
another thing I heard along this space

675
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:44,370
this was from someone on Google's red

676
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,899
team where she said that not just the

677
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,239
impact of a red team is not just the

678
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,809
number of bugs found but it's also like

679
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,690
what additional sort of attacker tactics

680
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:56,158
and indicators of compromise did you

681
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,169
test that the blue team was not

682
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,330
effectively finding and sort of like the

683
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:02,549
the additional protection mechanisms put

684
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,928
in place as a result of the testing not

685
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:06,330
just the bugs is sort of like an

686
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,669
important value add which I thought was

687
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,340
cool yeah definitely I also would say

688
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:12,480
that coming back to asset inventory

689
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,120
something that the red team can often

690
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,460
help with is identifying the things that

691
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,379
you have out there we're really good at

692
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,200
finding those little weird things that

693
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,390
nobody knows about so I've got a

694
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,360
spectacular failure case of that

695
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,890
actually which would be of the how those

696
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,158
two things actually came together which

697
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,720
was we ran a kind of no scope attack

698
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,539
simulation where our attackers could do

699
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,120
we handed them a laptop and said it's as

700
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:42,870
if you fished an employee go just do

701
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,489
whatever you want and one of the one of

702
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:47,489
the controls that we expected to detect

703
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:49,559
them earlier early on was a network

704
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,669
enumeration right if they they popped

705
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:53,010
the laptop they're gonna kind of

706
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:54,510
enumerate the environment and kind of

707
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,360
figure out what's there before they move

708
00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:00,600
on to specific targets and it got two

709
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,979
days into the assessment and like are

710
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,389
these consultants on another project

711
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,100
well they look like they haven't they

712
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,340
haven't tripped any of these alarms that

713
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,899
we've done in here and this is

714
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,100
ridiculous you're not doing anything and

715
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,970
later that day they called us up and

716
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,760
they're like here's the production

717
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:17,520
database oh okay yeah you have been busy

718
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,320
and when we went through the debrief

719
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,059
we're like we were really curious why

720
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,740
none of the controls we've done around

721
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:25,139
network enumeration and asset

722
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:28,020
enumeration none of those tripped and

723
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,030
like oh yeah yeah yeah that's really

724
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,740
cool that you've cleverly instrumented

725
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,928
all these parts of your boats

726
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,090
corporate network and production network

727
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:37,830
yeah you geniuses didn't put any

728
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,240
authentication on your internal wiki so

729
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,370
you just have a network diagram right

730
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,020
there's we just knew exactly what hosts

731
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,510
to go to we'd have to enumerate anything

732
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,389
and I think was the perfect example of

733
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:50,820
asset enumeration via your red team as a

734
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:55,320
way to feedback into your blue team

735
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:57,870
controls yeah yeah I would also say that

736
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,100
in general back to the question of you

737
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,158
know how to how to make your red team

738
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:04,709
successful is the other side to that

739
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,270
experiment is getting the results of

740
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,090
your experiment out to all the right

741
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,149
people and being that feedback loop into

742
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,320
all the other parts of the organization

743
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:16,439
and making sure that you stick around

744
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,120
and actually follow through on the

745
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,520
things that you've found and don't call

746
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:24,719
it done until those things are no longer

747
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:27,210
possible I think one thing I do want to

748
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,529
call out related to just red team or

749
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:32,010
offensive security assessments in

750
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:34,289
general is yes it can be a great tool to

751
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:36,690
increase like organizational awareness

752
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:38,370
around security and things like that

753
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,659
but you also want to balance that with

754
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:43,229
making sure that you're not damaging

755
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:45,090
trust with your customers if it can feel

756
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,830
like you're trying to trick them or

757
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,689
you're trying to make them look stupid

758
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,189
or make them look like they don't know

759
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,990
what they're doing with the systems

760
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:54,710
they're responsible for so it's really

761
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:57,210
really important to be aware of that

762
00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:01,380
trade-off we'd kind of the

763
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:02,820
organizational awareness yeah yeah

764
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,480
that's a good point

765
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:07,559
so another question from the audience is

766
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,690
what are your thoughts on threat

767
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,789
modeling and security reviews how

768
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,470
important is this work to you and how do

769
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:20,429
you scale this effectively as your

770
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:22,559
organization grows so one of the things

771
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:24,750
that we have tried to do in this space

772
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,460
is so we handled sort of threat modeling

773
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,559
and design reviews through our

774
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,750
application security teams on call and

775
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,020
what we have tried to do is we have

776
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:36,029
tried to find cases where we are track

777
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:38,370
modeling similar things or doing design

778
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:42,289
reviews for similar scenarios and then

779
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:42,289
figure out where how can we

780
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:47,610
how can we make most of these variables

781
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:51,180
go away meaning using the pave route to

782
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:52,830
say oh there is a solution for you know

783
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,390
the authentication proxy you can use

784
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,040
that has a bunch of these features and

785
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,860
they're already and then how can we

786
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,200
standardize guidance for things that we

787
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,060
solve for all the time so that your

788
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,560
security guidance does not depend on how

789
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:07,050
cynical your security person is feeling

790
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:10,020
that day and you're getting consistent

791
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:11,820
guidance and it actually becomes easy to

792
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,010
do something like that through on-call

793
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,500
and that doesn't become sort of the

794
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,330
majority of your time you're spending on

795
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,930
just doing those individual threat

796
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:25,050
models and design reviews yeah I think

797
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:29,220
I'm pretty good likings example of this

798
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:30,090
as well is so recently you have made

799
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,610
some changes in the security

800
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,010
organization and I inherited a team that

801
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:37,469
was doing attack detection and an

802
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:39,570
alerting type of work and they've done a

803
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:42,150
lot of good work over you know a few

804
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,580
months before you know I inherited the

805
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:47,640
team but they but but there was like

806
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,169
there wasn't any real framework to the

807
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,510
detection strategies that they were

808
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:54,660
creating and so I wanted to find a way

809
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:56,910
to put like to focus that right and so

810
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,010
we talked about threat modeling just in

811
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,690
general and then the more we talk about

812
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,180
what are we gonna threat model AWS

813
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:05,580
threat model every service individually

814
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,590
and then GCP as well and then Lenny and

815
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,169
so you know we kind of threw out that

816
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:12,689
idea but what we ended up doing was

817
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,400
looking at you know existing frameworks

818
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:16,080
and so we settled on miters attack

819
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,320
framework and they had someone recently

820
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,199
I think come out with cloud-based one

821
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,760
and so we essentially did like a gap

822
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,770
analysis right with like what our

823
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,420
current detection strategies and where

824
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:29,370
where do they line up on this on this

825
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,960
board and then you know where are our

826
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:33,149
gaps you know if we have like two or

827
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,470
three detection detections for this

828
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:37,230
particular strategy or this particular

829
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:38,850
attack type well then like yeah we want

830
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,890
to fill in all of those blocks and fill

831
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,360
in that entire matrix but like we've

832
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,610
already got 2 out of 5 that's pretty

833
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,010
good over here we've got five columns

834
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,659
that have zero colored boxes in them and

835
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,480
so maybe we should kind of focus on that

836
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,460
first as we like you know kind of just

837
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,330
go along and try to essentially fill up

838
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,359
this this

839
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:59,609
graff and the other reason I like that

840
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,218
like strategy is is that it didn't

841
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:04,559
require us to really dig in and do a

842
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:06,419
whole bunch of extra work right someone

843
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,709
already did that work for us we took

844
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,969
that framework so if that matrix has

845
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:10,889
started filling it in with what we've

846
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:12,769
got and it gives us a really good visual

847
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:14,998
representation of how we are progressing

848
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:16,589
over each particular quarter each

849
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,509
particular month whatever has the graph

850
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:20,940
slowly like as those boxes slowly get

851
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:23,489
colored in we can make an animated gif

852
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,589
and put it somewhere and show our boss

853
00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:27,779
and then it but like that gives you like

854
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:29,519
some concrete metrics to say like now

855
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:32,399
look matter tech firm may not be perfect

856
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,839
but it's something and you know if we

857
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,299
can fill in all those boxes we can feel

858
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,950
really good about the amount of attacks

859
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:41,519
and the different strategies that we can

860
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:43,259
detect yeah I think threat modeling is

861
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,489
definitely something I've heard again

862
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:46,759
and again from different companies in

863
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:48,839
terms of like how do you scale it and so

864
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:50,729
like development is happening very

865
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,320
quickly there's a handful of apps tech

866
00:32:50,729 --> 00:32:54,239
engineers and maybe thousands of

867
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,729
developers you can throw out model every

868
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:59,459
story so I've seen sort of three primary

869
00:32:56,729 --> 00:33:01,529
approaches so the first is having

870
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:03,179
developers fill out a sort of self

871
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:04,559
service security questionnaire where

872
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:08,099
it's okay you're building a new feature

873
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,918
or like a new sort of epic or story

874
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:11,759
level we're gonna give you this

875
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,049
questionnaire that says okay what

876
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,659
technologies are you using what

877
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:18,059
sensitive data are you touching are you

878
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:20,070
going to be like parsing XML or URLs or

879
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:22,139
what language are you using basically

880
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,939
what are things that a security person

881
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:25,678
would probably ask you and then at the

882
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,409
output of that it says oh here's some

883
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,820
framework specific guidance here's some

884
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:32,249
things you should make sure not to do

885
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,779
and overall just computes sort of a risk

886
00:33:32,249 --> 00:33:35,549
score for how risky is this new thing

887
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:36,809
you're building and then the security

888
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:38,429
team rather than having the threat model

889
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:40,109
everything they can then meet with the

890
00:33:38,429 --> 00:33:41,700
teams who are building things that are

891
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:42,649
most likely to be the riskiest right

892
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,079
because you have to prioritize

893
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:48,928
another thing is basically integrating

894
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,999
threat modeling into the development

895
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:52,320
lifecycle itself like hey we're gonna

896
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:55,249
talk about what it needs to do what's

897
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,269
the acceptance criteria and then also

898
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:59,159
like hey how could this feature be

899
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:01,139
abused and then what can we do to

900
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,029
prevent that so you just add on like one

901
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,829
or two threat model II type questions I

902
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:06,680
think Adams Shostak has like a card game

903
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:08,449
as well that can be played during

904
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,490
discussions and then lastly there's this

905
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:12,310
concept of like threat model is code

906
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:14,418
where you're basically making

907
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,418
integration tests but they're sort of

908
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:18,589
security tests where you're assuming

909
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:21,109
certain abuse cases and then actually

910
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,940
codifying that in code so a security

911
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,679
questionnaire is integrating threat

912
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,330
modeling into the SDLC and then

913
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:29,590
throughout modulus code is three

914
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:32,149
approaches I've seen some companies do

915
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:34,970
okay cool so there's a number of

916
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:36,859
questions about sort of abstract

917
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:39,889
pipeline like continuous security

918
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:43,310
scanning and I guess what would be some

919
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:47,060
useful metrics of success or what sort

920
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:50,000
of scanning continuous scanning in terms

921
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:54,259
of static or whatever you have the

922
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,100
highest ROI for you I think really

923
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,850
targeted scanning similar to sort of

924
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,100
what you were talking about before

925
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:04,220
instead of trying to do everything well

926
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,700
do pick one thing and do that really

927
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,459
well

928
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:10,430
and find kill that class of bugs

929
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:13,750
everywhere rather than trying to sort of

930
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:17,060
focus on killing everything everywhere

931
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:19,310
yeah yeah I mean we basically to be

932
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:22,640
successful in kind of continuous canny

933
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:24,320
plugging in to see ICD SAS - whatever

934
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,910
you want to call it now you kind of

935
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,670
invert the model that we've always done

936
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:31,250
here exactly as you saying right if SAST

937
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:33,020
and DAST was always a very heavyweight

938
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,490
top-down control where we said we're

939
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,860
gonna turn this on across our codebase

940
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,270
spend 18 months tuning the thing and

941
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,210
then figure it out and it'll eventually

942
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:43,730
work we promise and really to be

943
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,950
effective in this world that either your

944
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:48,200
organization is already in or rapidly

945
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,730
going into the only way you keep up with

946
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,950
the scale and the pace is to start

947
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:54,320
bottoms up and say we're gonna pick this

948
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:57,169
bone class then this vaughn class then

949
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,880
this bone class on up and just start

950
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:02,060
bottoms up with those let's pick a few

951
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,400
things in each one work our way up from

952
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,529
there and what I mean specifically if

953
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,820
work your way up is getting to the point

954
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,290
where it can be self served by the

955
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,820
development teams or DevOps teams

956
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,140
themselves all right it's something that

957
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,180
spits out a huge report that the

958
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,660
security team has to parse and then send

959
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:19,299
on to another team it doesn't scale you

960
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,680
drowning in that in no time you have to

961
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:22,990
be able to have something that can like

962
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,058
I mean as simple and as dumb as great

963
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:27,189
here's the four things we grep for for

964
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:28,329
this vulnerability class or the four

965
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,970
things we grep for that say you've

966
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:33,490
disabled key paved road security checks

967
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:35,919
and it auto Flags a ticket in Giro or

968
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:38,140
your bug tracking ticket directly to the

969
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,910
development teams get that for as many

970
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,190
things as you can before you start to go

971
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:45,368
up in complex and that's in this kind of

972
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:48,700
area of continuous scan II and CI CD

973
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:49,920
that's the only way you scale grep works

974
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,390
pretty good

975
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,890
yeah actually one of my favorite quotes

976
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,020
about that this was like two apps at

977
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:59,288
Callie's ago we had a similar panel so

978
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:02,410
DIF Dada a very senior security person

979
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:03,640
at Dropbox PhD in computer science did a

980
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,129
number of papers on like symbolic

981
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:10,808
execution like crazy crazy smart and he

982
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:12,819
was like grep is awesome man like I mean

983
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:14,380
I said it to be wiseass but but

984
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:16,779
seriously like if you can find if

985
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,369
there's a number I mean it's not a

986
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,069
silver bullet right like it's it's not a

987
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:22,329
it's not a solved problem period even if

988
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:23,259
you had all the time in the world and if

989
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:25,359
you're again you're trying to keep up

990
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,770
with the pace of development at your in

991
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,038
your company you're never gonna have

992
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:31,359
enough time it's like stack analysis I

993
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,760
think is one of those things that if you

994
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,000
get to like 50 percent effectiveness

995
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,680
like you want to be honest like it's not

996
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,230
a solved problem but like grep and just

997
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,868
like looking at dangerous patterns that

998
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:46,150
are specific to the frameworks the apps

999
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:49,089
the the code that you use in your in

1000
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,890
your company will get you a large

1001
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:52,690
portion of the way there right like take

1002
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:55,359
old bugs and you know kind of like

1003
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,339
search for those patterns and you can do

1004
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,940
that pretty easily in in you know in

1005
00:37:57,339 --> 00:37:59,650
your CI

1006
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,900
and I think like having a very tight

1007
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,730
feedback loop there and and and telling

1008
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,500
the developer or the engineer like what

1009
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:07,119
what happened and why and how they can

1010
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,670
fix it and how they can reach out to if

1011
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:13,690
they need help like as soon as or as

1012
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:16,900
close to as close to it as possible

1013
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:20,020
I'm never gonna get that sentence up but

1014
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:22,329
like as soon as they've written that bug

1015
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,880
is is the bet the better you can do I'm

1016
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:26,250
great to like I dated all like every

1017
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,420
developer use their own I

1018
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,490
like there's like five or six different

1019
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,950
kind of like we can't can't maintain

1020
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:33,689
plugins for all that stuff but next best

1021
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:35,390
step for us is github right and so

1022
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:37,740
that's where we've done a bunch of MRSA

1023
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:39,750
secondarily like get lab and like the

1024
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,339
the deployment pipelines right gonna run

1025
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,720
a bunch of tests there other devs and

1026
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,099
engineers are running a whole bunch of

1027
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,629
other linters and all these other sorts

1028
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,490
of things like we can throw a security

1029
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,020
test in there too it's not that that's

1030
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,569
like a little bit farther away than I

1031
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,400
would prefer but in some cases that's

1032
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:55,230
the if that's the best we can do for a

1033
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,430
particular application or service then

1034
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,470
I'll take that any day of the week

1035
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:00,118
rather than waiting for Justine and her

1036
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,740
crew to come and tell me that it's a

1037
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,240
problem and then I've to file the bug

1038
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,250
and we have to follow up and then mole

1039
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,140
management takes over and you know six

1040
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:10,830
months later maybe that medium gets

1041
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:13,080
fixed one of the things related to this

1042
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:15,060
that has worked well for us from an ROI

1043
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,759
standpoint has been some of the work

1044
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:20,490
we've done with finding vulnerable

1045
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,349
dependencies in our ecosystem in very

1046
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:25,229
close partnership with our build and

1047
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:29,099
change teams so they have all of this

1048
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:31,650
tooling related to wanting to basically

1049
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:34,080
manage change cycles for software and

1050
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:36,150
turns out that we are trying to do the

1051
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,680
same thing for security reasons so we

1052
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,869
have worked really closely with those

1053
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,140
teams to figure out okay how do we

1054
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:45,060
integrate vulnerable dependency

1055
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:49,020
information well with some of their

1056
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,640
tooling to flag the highest criticality

1057
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,339
things that we care about in our

1058
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,290
ecosystem by language and then the way

1059
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:57,330
we've approached it is okay this

1060
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:59,759
language is most used in our ecosystem

1061
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,520
let's go after that first let's draw a

1062
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,800
line related to what criticality will

1063
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,500
look at what are internal things we know

1064
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,690
that impact criticality so meaning

1065
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,730
things like is this internet-facing is

1066
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:13,710
this a central tool that is used by a

1067
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,960
bunch of people things like that so

1068
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,599
taking that criteria into our triaging

1069
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,670
process as the apps act team and then

1070
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,130
really working closely with the central

1071
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:25,950
engineering teams to solve that class of

1072
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:27,630
problem for a certain criticality level

1073
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,520
for a certain language before we move on

1074
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:35,460
to the next and that has worked fairly

1075
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:37,800
well for us nice thank you I like this

1076
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,630
one a lot what's the most effective

1077
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,830
security engagement and aware

1078
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,530
initiative you've done with your

1079
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:45,420
engineering teams and I know Zayn in

1080
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:52,940
particular I think has a story he might

1081
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:55,740
like to share I I'll start with that one

1082
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:59,790
one of the things that led to some of

1083
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:01,830
the best security relationships and bug

1084
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,940
Disko just important security

1085
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:07,920
discoveries all euphemistically say

1086
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:10,650
would be just finding ways to have the

1087
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,810
team have engineering teams engage with

1088
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,670
security and it's really dumb stuff that

1089
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:17,549
actually makes a successful it is

1090
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:19,680
literally looking at a lot of times

1091
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,960
floor plans and having the security team

1092
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,759
sit in central locations so that other

1093
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,860
teams walk past your security team

1094
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,080
because we lost track of the number of

1095
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,090
times that a major security review

1096
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,410
started because somebody walked past and

1097
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:33,360
like made eye contact and kind of waved

1098
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:35,460
low and then did a double-take and was

1099
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,540
like oh actually you know since I'm here

1100
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,250
I've got a question for you about

1101
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:41,009
something we're thinking about and it

1102
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,780
was this oh you're designing remote code

1103
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:48,450
execution as a service okay got it

1104
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:50,400
like those sort of things happen off of

1105
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:52,379
that off of the thing Doug was laughing

1106
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,080
about which is how we leveled up that

1107
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:57,090
technique of putting security centrally

1108
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,060
in different engineering offices we

1109
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:01,770
literally put out bowls of candy on the

1110
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,600
thing and the amount of folks that

1111
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:07,140
flocked to the security area suddenly

1112
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:09,380
went through the roof the other security

1113
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:13,140
budget that we used was literally some

1114
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:15,150
folks from our team say hey who wants to

1115
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,160
wants to go out to at happy hour tonight

1116
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,700
great this engineering team is going to

1117
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,799
a happy hour

1118
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,419
go to that put the last two rounds of

1119
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,150
drinks on the security team just buy a

1120
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,800
round of drinks I guarantee you someone

1121
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,910
is going to ask you about some product

1122
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,250
that they're working on or some feature

1123
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,990
that they're working on and it was the

1124
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,090
single best use of security budget

1125
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:36,000
between bowls of candy and buying a few

1126
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:37,260
drinks that we got that I wish I could

1127
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,060
go into the details of the things that

1128
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,310
that uncovered right and it's it's

1129
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:45,210
things like that that actually become

1130
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:46,890
really effective in driving traffic into

1131
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,020
the security team because if you start

1132
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:51,390
to get the closing thought on that I'd

1133
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,830
say is for me is

1134
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,540
you have to think about your security

1135
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:57,299
team as a business inside the business

1136
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:58,860
and this is your marketing budget right

1137
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,530
be thinking about how are you driving

1138
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:05,190
folks to come engage with your product

1139
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:07,560
which is security expertise one of the

1140
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,680
things that we've done recently is

1141
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:13,890
actually have the engineering team that

1142
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:15,960
we're targeting on a red team work with

1143
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:17,220
us on exploiting something so we're like

1144
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:19,650
okay we found something we're gonna

1145
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,540
exploit it will you know a lot of times

1146
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,460
red team's traditionally are very secret

1147
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,930
no one knows about it but instead we

1148
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,510
kind of do the opposite and say hey

1149
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:31,020
we're gonna exploit this thing real in

1150
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:33,120
production join us and see it in action

1151
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,410
and learn about how your thing works in

1152
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,319
a different way than you realized

1153
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:40,109
and that's been really interesting and

1154
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:42,870
fun and engaging and really helpful for

1155
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:46,170
the red team to to understand more about

1156
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:50,850
how products work and things we hadn't

1157
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:53,190
thought about before so we don't do a

1158
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:55,200
ton in the awareness engagement space

1159
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:57,600
but I think one thing that consistently

1160
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,089
works well is when somebody comes to

1161
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,250
talk to you create a really good

1162
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:04,920
experience for them so if they came to

1163
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:07,350
you for a security review and then you

1164
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,750
end and ended up kind of like pushing

1165
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:11,339
their timelines by a bunch and not

1166
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,620
really being helpful and just throwing

1167
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:15,720
requirements over the wall to them

1168
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,790
they're not gonna come back so create a

1169
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,770
good experience when folks do come and

1170
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:22,830
engage with you and they will definitely

1171
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:25,020
return yeah I mean 100% I think that's

1172
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:26,880
really really important is to just yeah

1173
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:30,270
be as realistic as possible right and

1174
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,170
don't even even if you're your first you

1175
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:33,930
know the first thing you think of is to

1176
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:36,270
say no no way or dear god no you know

1177
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,890
remote execution as a service seen a few

1178
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:40,590
of those as well right like that's it's

1179
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,480
terrifying but again like they're human

1180
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:44,510
right and the other thing I would add on

1181
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,010
to that is that we try very hard to be

1182
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:48,500
as responsive as possible even if we

1183
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,760
don't have the answer right they're like

1184
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,080
if you leave a message in the in the

1185
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,850
security slack channel it's not gonna

1186
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,470
hang out there for two days right like

1187
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:57,180
it's I mean listen we're not hard

1188
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,980
percent on that but you know just try to

1189
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,210
be as responsive as possible like your

1190
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,740
time is valuable my time is valuable

1191
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,890
let's all we're all in this together you

1192
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,399
know that's the message

1193
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:09,730
I do okay cool so uh we're gonna start

1194
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:14,349
wrapping it up so just final thing if

1195
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:15,789
you were to join a new organization or

1196
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:18,609
just in general looks like the biggest

1197
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:20,559
highest impact thing you would do like

1198
00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:22,269
maybe the thing you would do first or if

1199
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:26,970
a company isn't doing this you would

1200
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:34,058
make sure that that happened I would say

1201
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:35,828
visibility into yeah I mean the core

1202
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:38,260
foundations I think of all of this is

1203
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:41,200
knowing what you have and knowing who

1204
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,940
owns it knowing what it is and being

1205
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,259
able to have visibility of what's

1206
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:48,940
happening on your systems

1207
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:52,299
I got nothing now actually one thing I

1208
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:53,710
was thinking of was um you know if I was

1209
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:56,890
in charge and had the resources I think

1210
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:59,410
I would try to protect uh either a very

1211
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:00,640
small team or a few individuals I try to

1212
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:03,160
protect them from the interrupt-driven

1213
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,368
work so they could kind of like take the

1214
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,348
longer view on certain types of problems

1215
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:10,299
I again it's just a big thing with us

1216
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:12,549
like prioritizing and dealing with

1217
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:14,710
interrupts is really painful to get

1218
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:15,910
actually like work done again we're

1219
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:17,500
there to handle the interrupts we're

1220
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:19,149
there to support the rest of the

1221
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,829
business I totally get that and I

1222
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:22,539
totally accept it but something you know

1223
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:23,890
how do you level up if you don't have

1224
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:25,390
time how do you where do you find the

1225
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,368
time to create these frameworks and the

1226
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:29,348
paved road for folks if you can't you

1227
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:30,819
know get your head straight so I think

1228
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:32,349
that was one that is one thing I would

1229
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:36,788
do given you know the amount of

1230
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:39,279
resources other than that visibility I

1231
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:41,769
would say make sure that you have an

1232
00:46:39,279 --> 00:46:43,900
understanding of what is the risk you're

1233
00:46:41,769 --> 00:46:45,578
trying to reduce so just an

1234
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,609
understanding of the enterprises risk

1235
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:50,140
what is most important and you know like

1236
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:52,210
what's going to be the existential

1237
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:55,029
worst-case scenario for the company so

1238
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:57,009
you can start prioritizing starting from

1239
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:59,740
that because you're not gonna solve all

1240
00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:00,910
their problems and day one I'd say when

1241
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,910
you're when you're going into a new

1242
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:05,308
security leadership role in a new

1243
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:07,868
organization or anything like that

1244
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:09,700
bringing it up one level here I would

1245
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:12,339
say the number one thing to focus on is

1246
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,120
getting that buy-in from the other teams

1247
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:15,490
and go

1248
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:18,160
to them and stating explicitly look if

1249
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:19,240
you're going to any Enterprise tech

1250
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,040
company it really doesn't matter the

1251
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,629
size of the company someone there that

1252
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,670
you're going to need their buy-in has

1253
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:26,140
had a negative experience with security

1254
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:30,010
at some point in their career I can

1255
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:31,540
guarantee right and so if you want any

1256
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,070
of your projects to ultimately be

1257
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:35,860
successful the route that you actually

1258
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:37,390
have to start at on there is going to

1259
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,790
those teams and saying hey security is

1260
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:41,890
here to help enable you do this you to

1261
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,170
do the stuff that you want to do we're

1262
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,339
not always gonna get it right but I want

1263
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,870
your feedback from when we're not

1264
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,970
getting it right so that we can adapt

1265
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:50,859
because that's the only way that you're

1266
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,419
not gonna have teams trying to route

1267
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:53,860
around you and not tell the security

1268
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:55,750
team what's going on or anything like

1269
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,130
that you've got to get that trust and

1270
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:00,460
you got to start it right in the

1271
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:03,730
beginning well and something I would say

1272
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:05,830
is vulnerability management it doesn't

1273
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:07,600
necessarily sound very sexy but you need

1274
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:10,750
to know where you are and when you're

1275
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:12,670
doing various initiatives you want to be

1276
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:15,730
able to say oh this actually worked not

1277
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:17,920
just it was a good idea right okay cool

1278
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:20,050
well thank you so much for your time I'm

1279
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,450
going to be talking about related stuff

1280
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:25,420
like this in about like an hour or an

1281
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:27,370
hour and a half yeah come up we would

1282
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,020
love to say hi and I have some stickers

1283
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:31,259

1284
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,259

[Applause]
