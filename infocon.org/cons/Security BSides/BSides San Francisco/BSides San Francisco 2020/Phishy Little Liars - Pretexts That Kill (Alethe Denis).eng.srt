1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:10,349
welcome this is Elise Dennis she is a

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,420
black badge winner at the SCC CTF she's

3
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,099
also the founder of dragonfly and she's

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,960
got an awesome talk for you please give

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,960
her your respect and a round of applause

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,000
thank you all for being here I really

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,000
appreciate you taking time out of your

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
happy hour to come join me to talk a

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,690
little bit about pretexting we're gonna

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,160
jump right in because I think that this

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,269
day has been long enough for everyone

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,029
and I want to give you the most bang for

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:47,280
your buck so this is me my name is Elise

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:49,350
and I'm kind of breaking the format of

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,480
the show by telling you who a is from

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,079
the start but today we're going to be

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,730
talking about developing pretexts using

18
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,390
intelligence that we gather from open

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,699
source sources on the interwebs and

20
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,450
using that data to build a pretext that

21
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,950
is custom to your target quickly so the

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,170
first thing that we're gonna do is look

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,909
at the anatomy of a pretext then we're

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,630
also going to look at pretext points of

25
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:18,030
failure and oesn't and sock mint social

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,548
in social media intelligence gathering

27
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,280
for pretext and then finally we're going

28
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:27,090
to build a pretext using the information

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,829
that we found so what this talk is not

30
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,420
really quick it has been modified from

31
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,820
it's a vision original version and

32
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,640
format to run in the allocated time so I

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,500
am in a speed suit through some stuff

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,509
just so that we can reach the end of the

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,750
talk without eliminating the meet of

36
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,490
this talk so the views and opinions that

37
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,060
I expressed today do not reflect that of

38
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,820
my employers past previant previous past

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,939
present or future this is not also a

40
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,520
deep or extensive dive into oesn't

41
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,130
or building rapport and of course this

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,908
is not for malicious use and/or legal

43
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,979
advice so what is a pretext a pretext is

44
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,009
something that you are something that

45
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,649
you do something you have and then

46
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,600
something that you need the pretext is

47
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,200
really built from what you need

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,820
and a combination of what you have and

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,100
that's what we discovered during the

50
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,109
ocean part is what you can have to

51
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,210
substantiate the pretext that you need

52
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,480
in order to gain access to the

53
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,120
information that you want so how do

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,420
pretext fail honestly the number one

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,090
thing I think is confidence if you don't

56
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:40,049
have confidence and you are not prepared

57
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:43,500
to overcome objections of your target or

58
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,480
if you sound a little bit anxious and

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,970
you're trying to carry an authority

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,730
pretext you're gonna give your target

61
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,380
the opportunity to give you objections

62
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:57,480
and to question the validity of your

63
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,460
pretext so secondly after confidence

64
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,769
would really be simplicity the more

65
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,080
things that you throw at your target to

66
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,730
try to substantiate your pretext the

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,890
more information they're gonna have to

68
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,989
work through in their brain and you may

69
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,790
actually limit your ability to elicit

70
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,640
the types of information that you want

71
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,709
to get from them so keep it simple and

72
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,339
lead them to give you the information

73
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:22,470
that you want with a pretty direct line

74
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,170
of thought rather than overwhelming them

75
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:29,070
with facts about who you are why you're

76
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:32,190
calling that kind of stuff and then to

77
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,590
go along with your simplest simplicity

78
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,840
and your confidence you really need to

79
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,030
have the knowledge to back up what

80
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,490
you're saying and that is really where

81
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:45,980
the OSINT comes in and learning about

82
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:50,250
your targets organizations culture and

83
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:52,739
what makes them tick their biases how

84
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,540
they feel about life in general

85
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,960
all those things are going to help you

86
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,269
to become a member of their tribe and

87
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,100
then have the knowledge to overcome the

88
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,170
objections that they may or may not give

89
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,579
you if you do a really good job they're

90
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,769
probably not going to challenge you when

91
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,840
I start Olson for a specific

92
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,450
organization the first place that I go

93
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,880
is Glassdoor and then from there I'll go

94
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,478
into the brand profiles for LinkedIn and

95
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,430
from there I would move into who are

96
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,109
their employees and started like

97
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,950
thoroughly investigating the employee

98
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,110
profile

99
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,900
and stuff that's specific to the

100
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,250
individuals that work at the company

101
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,500
from there you can use things like

102
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,990
google dorks and Ozan tools other

103
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,500
websites to kind of fill in the gaps in

104
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:45,270
what you're trying to prepare to elicit

105
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,190
from the target these are a list or

106
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,840
these are some sites that I recommend

107
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,050
checking out just keep in mind that

108
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,460
Glassdoor is not the be-all end-all if

109
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,650
you can't find it on Glassdoor maybe

110
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,840
it's on indeed also companies don't

111
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,099
always take ownership so the profiles on

112
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,349
the lesser sites so they're not

113
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,830
monitoring them and there may be some

114
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,720
really inflammatory comments or reviews

115
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,060
some really scary stuff out there as far

116
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,080
as the c-suite would be concerned in

117
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,510
that company on some of the lesser-known

118
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,099
corporate review websites speaking of

119
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:19,170
corporate review websites you always

120
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,390
want to dig into the photos not

121
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,360
necessarily dude sitting there in his

122
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,610
costume but what's behind him what is

123
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,560
around him what else is in this photo

124
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,660
that's going to help us pretend if we're

125
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,240
using an internal pretext that we've

126
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,650
been in that office before that we know

127
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,500
where to go get a cup of coffee or a

128
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:40,679
bottle of water and from here we can see

129
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,020
actually physical access controls we can

130
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,970
see their break room the types of

131
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,120
hardware that they're using and in that

132
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:50,610
one photo we have the employee's badge

133
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:55,580
business cards letterhead their computer

134
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,580
oakland applications all from one photo

135
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:02,609
don't forget video my last year's target

136
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:05,070
for se CTF uploaded a video three days

137
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,510
before my report was due and that video

138
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,360
included all these wonderful images

139
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,670
along with a bunch more that really gave

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,410
me the foundation and the proof first

141
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,990
things that I had already suspected but

142
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,280
now we're in plain sight

143
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:20,000
companies are really really going out of

144
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,210
their way to try to create positive

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,280
perception of their brand for new and

146
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,770
perspective talent people that they want

147
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,789
to hire that are applying for jobs so

148
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,010
they're really going out of their way

149
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,780
right now to have a positive presence on

150
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,940
social media and that's really good for

151
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,820
us so from this

152
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,440
certain target they had a corporate

153
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,680
video like the ones I was discussing

154
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,960
where they had named their employees and

155
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,330
gave their job titles and from that I

156
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,400
was able to dig into their employees

157
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,880
social media their personal social media

158
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,469
LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Instagram

159
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,820
geotagged Instagram pictures by the way

160
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,130
are my most favorite thing in the

161
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,960
universe and these people that over

162
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,820
share on social media can actually be a

163
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,190
detriment to the rest of their team too

164
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,810
because you have co-workers who are

165
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,420
commenting on their posts who don't

166
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,160
necessarily share things on social media

167
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,840
but now you've identified them in as an

168
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,850
employee and you can actually check out

169
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,010
their feeds as well and kind of link

170
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,200
those things together when you do that

171
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:24,130
you have the ability to find their side

172
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,530
hustles side hustle pages and groups

173
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:29,690
hobbies all of the comments on their

174
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,549
default pictures cover pictures all

175
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,260
those things are public and most people

176
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,550
don't really keep that in mind even if

177
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,820
their Facebook is locked down pretty

178
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,500
well check out their likes their reviews

179
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,980
of local businesses and try to get a

180
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,100
flavor of their personality and who you

181
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,140
think might be a soft target with this

182
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,700
particular individual I identified that

183
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,940
the company had a corporate Giving

184
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,890
Manager this person was really prolific

185
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,590
on social media with sharing their

186
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,599
causes thoughts beliefs opinions and I

187
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:03,650
learned that she was a parent that she

188
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:08,000
had several social media profiles as

189
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:11,840
well as a creative writing career as a

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,090
consultant I also found that the company

191
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,520
had published their press releases

192
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:19,369
giving the numbers for their giving

193
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,289
campaigns for the last few years and I

194
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:24,169
was going to take this information and

195
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,690
use that to substantiate the fact that I

196
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,219
was potentially with the charity did I

197
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,690
know what the numbers were for the year

198
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,340
before that I have a good understanding

199
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:36,110
of their participation in that campaign

200
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:38,150
so what did the facts do that we found

201
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,400
they really substantiate and give your

202
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,409
pre-tax credibility the facts are what

203
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,090
builds the story essentially we're

204
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,160
creating the story from the information

205
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,190
we have rather than trying to pick a

206
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,050
pretext and then support that pretext

207
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,320
using information we may or may not be

208
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,660
able

209
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,950
find yes it's a Foursquare if you have

210
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,240
ever worked in sales especially

211
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,650
automotive sales you're probably

212
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,840
shuttering but this is great because

213
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,360
it's really an easy way to keep track of

214
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,790
the information that you need to have

215
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,350
handy when you're either putting

216
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,170
together your pretext or actually

217
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,390
executing your vision calls or setting

218
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,760
up your phishing campaigns so who are

219
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,800
they what do you need and then from

220
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,980
there what information do you have

221
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,969
and what pretext can you build to become

222
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,650
who you have to be today

223
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,420
here's a sample pretext format we're

224
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,550
gonna start by deciding the basics are

225
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:34,160
you internal are you external are you

226
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,800
authority based pretexting or is it

227
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,630
going to be an empathetic pretext align

228
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,300
your biases with the person that you've

229
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,980
decided as your target and figure out

230
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,990
how you can emulate their culture and

231
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,640
I'm not just speaking about you know

232
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,290
ethnic culture but just the culture of

233
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,689
their them as an employee and how they

234
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,819
conduct themselves make sure you have

235
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,930
the jargon and the key words that are

236
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:04,670
used within this corporate environment

237
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:07,040
and then pick your pretext theme so

238
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,380
first we're gonna take notes of what

239
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,010
information we want to elicit from this

240
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,689
target we're thinking really hard and

241
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:16,490
then we're going to put in who we've

242
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,080
decided as our target put their name

243
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,640
their number all their contact

244
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,680
information this is going to help you

245
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,970
have a handy when you're talking to them

246
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,640
so you can stay on track and not fumble

247
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,370
anything then you need to figure out who

248
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,410
you are if you're somebody from a vendor

249
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,660
and maybe you're not gonna pretext to

250
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,300
somebody internal make sure that you

251
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,579
have your name done euro sent on the

252
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,219
second company figured out what numbers

253
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,080
you need to spoof what your title is who

254
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,580
you are and what gives you a reason to

255
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,550
ask for the information that you're

256
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,380
going to try to elicit finally figure

257
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,719
out what your motivations are who are

258
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,340
you as a person what are your biases

259
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,770
what's your culture and how is that

260
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,050
going to make you part of the tribe of

261
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:04,100
the person that you're trying to elicit

262
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:07,160
the information from so

263
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,079
using what you have you're going to have

264
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,019
the goal in mind that you want to build

265
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:14,540
rapport quickly link ideas together from

266
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:16,959
one item to the next as far as the

267
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,819
elements that you're trying to elicit

268
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,130
memorize your flags so to speak the

269
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,350
information that you want try to fit

270
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,079
them into a natural conversation and be

271
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:29,120
prepared to segue or come back to a

272
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:29,719
point if your conversation goes off

273
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,779
track

274
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,449
try not to script yourself too much and

275
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:36,949
then always be prepared to pivot if it

276
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:38,899
turns out that this target is a lot

277
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:40,870
softer than maybe you expected and you

278
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,160
have the ability to elicit more

279
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,779
information that what you came for

280
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,560
pivot into another line of conversation

281
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:49,790
and see if you can extract that as well

282
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,459
so we're using the data to create a

283
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,139
custom pretext and not picking a pretext

284
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:56,479
based on the data now you've got your

285
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:58,699
full pretext on this little Foursquare

286
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,130
and this is actually what I took with me

287
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:03,829
into the booth at DEFCON for the SE CTF

288
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:06,339
that's the only page that I had I didn't

289
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:09,699
bring a computer or any gimmicks or

290
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:12,649
props or anything it was just these and

291
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:14,300
they really helped me to figure out how

292
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,880
I was going to approach the conversation

293
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,399
and then if I got sidetracked or nervous

294
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,110
or intimidated I could always bring it

295
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:26,209
back using just a quick reminder from

296
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:29,029
these pages with this particular

297
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:30,529
employee I figured out some of the

298
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:31,760
things that we mentioned before so I'm

299
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:35,420
going to click through these really

300
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,760
quick but I called and I said that I'd

301
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,050
sent her a PDF the week before and had

302
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,819
she received my email

303
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,859
of course I hadn't sent her an email so

304
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:45,500
no she didn't get it and at this point

305
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,899
she's feeling emotionally like she's

306
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,050
letting me down so this is gonna give me

307
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,610
a really good foundation for using an

308
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,949
empathy pretext because she already

309
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,260
feels indebted to me so I confirmed

310
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:59,209
using an erroneous email that I had sent

311
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,250
it to the wrong place and so she gave me

312
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:04,779
her correct email and then committed to

313
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:07,130
follow up and complete the PDF form and

314
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:10,189
absolutely open it when she received it

315
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,649
so I have her buy-in to do that which is

316
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:15,319
fantastic she also shared some other

317
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:17,720
information with me and I was able to

318
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:20,149
elicit you know elements of soft

319
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,709
we're hardware and other things about

320
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:27,620
her business from that point she did

321
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:31,638
begin to kind of question why I needed

322
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:33,740
all of this information and she she

323
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,379
started to get suspicious because I

324
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,180
asked for the same thing twice and I

325
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:39,920
immediately apologized and just you know

326
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,620
said I'm so flustered I'm so sorry I'm

327
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,810
working from home today remotely with a

328
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,850
sick kid and immediately because she was

329
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:51,800
a parent she dropped all of her

330
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:54,649
suspicions so that's how to build a

331
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:59,060
pretext using the information that you

332
00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:01,910
find through OSINT and using open

333
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,609
sources to create custom pretext in

334
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,949
order to really elicit the information

335
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,560
that you want using things that are

336
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:14,810
going to make your targets want to tell

337
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:16,758
you I am I am so happy that you all came

338
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,550
today and I appreciate you for your time

339
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,439
and also a big thank you to be side San

340
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,139
Francisco to him for inviting me to

341
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,050
speak to you today if there's any

342
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:28,730
questions or anything that you would

343
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:35,839
like I'm going to open the floor right

344
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:38,439
now for questions I can run the mic up

345
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,439
to anybody

346
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,579
well first off congratulations on well

347
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,459
this is really lat

348
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:07,200
congratulations on the black badge

349
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:11,530
success winning se CTF thank you putting

350
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,900
putting on more of a defensive hat I've

351
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:17,110
heard a lot of reports about the media

352
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:20,380
platforms cracking down on fabricated

353
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:24,670
accounts and also trying to protect

354
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:26,590
users privacy more mm-hmm do you do you

355
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,860
think that is a step in the right

356
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:32,080
direction for protecting employees or is

357
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,050
it more just going to shift the field

358
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,640
for the offensive side well I will tell

359
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,520
you that all of my sock puppets are

360
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:42,400
alive and well and I would say that even

361
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,770
though there are a lot of you know

362
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,720
measures being taken to do that that

363
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,880
it's absolutely essential that we teach

364
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,220
our people how to identify these types

365
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,020
of threats and really lean into training

366
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,330
and awareness to avoid these things

367
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,060
rather than counting on third parties to

368
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,220
you know eliminate fake accounts or try

369
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:03,609
to stop those kind of things from

370
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:11,290
happening on platforms good answer thank

371
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:13,390
you there is one thing I did forget to

372
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:16,030
mention in my talk and that is that we

373
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,500
want to avoid having people get that

374
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,870
little gut feeling that something's

375
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,450
wrong and it's kind of like when you're

376
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,160
driving in a car you have you know

377
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:26,170
people following you but it seems like

378
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,819
you only notice the car behind you when

379
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,650
it's already too close and that's

380
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,360
because your subconscious is continually

381
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:33,730
scanning your environment but it only

382
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,610
alerts your conscious to ask for help

383
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:39,280
when somebody has breached that you know

384
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,720
bubble of security and so what we're

385
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,670
doing with the pretexting is we're

386
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,310
actually trying to get as close to that

387
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,380
person's rear end without having the

388
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,150
subconscious alert them that something

389
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:54,270
might be wrong and that's why these

390
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:56,380
custom pretexts are really important my

391
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:59,620
my questions were of like a story

392
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,050
question okay what is one of the most

393
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:05,800
creative or interesting pretext that

394
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:08,619
you've used successfully I would say

395
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,230
that probably this charitable giving one

396
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,250
then I had another one where I

397
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:16,380
discovered that the target had a

398
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:19,300
cafeteria I posed as an employee of the

399
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,970
cafeteria vendor the foodservice vendor

400
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:25,869
and I said that I was coming on site to

401
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:27,850
train the employees of the cafeteria for

402
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:30,129
security awareness training and that I

403
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:32,790
had some questions about how I was going

404
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:36,010
to get on site that they have badges

405
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:38,020
who's my point of contact is IT on site

406
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,540
so that they can set up my projector for

407
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,850
me and all those kind of things and that

408
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,610
was probably one of the most fun the

409
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:48,129
pretext that I used for su CTF this last

410
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,870
year was just your hey we noticed you

411
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,670
hadn't connected to the VPN in a while

412
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,139
and we're getting ready to ship out new

413
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,210
computers we wanted to make sure that

414
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,890
we've got all the right software on the

415
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,020
computer for you before we ship it out

416
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:08,040
and so it wasn't like super interesting

417
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:08,040
or fun but just very effective sit down

418
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:16,660
so how might you translate this into

419
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,760
like a fishing training sort of exercise

420
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,130
if we want to send just emails versus

421
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,440
the very email fish yeah oh yeah

422
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,530
absolutely so if you find that your

423
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,440
target is really into model trains or

424
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:32,980
they're an avid Fisher person or they

425
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,809
like to hike or play video games all

426
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,090
those kind of things you can use to put

427
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,530
together a profile of that person to

428
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,330
create a fishing campaign

429
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,770
spearfishing campaign that would

430
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,659
definitely get a result I've heard of

431
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,300
companies that have been compromised by

432
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,890
a single email for a coin collecting

433
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,889
scam basically

434
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,250
about how much time do you say put into

435
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,170
prepping for any particular one of your

436
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,900
pretext you have a census it like an

437
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,820
hours at 20 hours it's too cool the goal

438
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,100
really with the way that I've set it up

439
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:18,110
an outlined it here is that you can do

440
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:21,709
it really quickly it shouldn't take you

441
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,360
more than a few hours preparing for sec

442
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,340
TF I spent over a hundred hours

443
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,199
compiling all the information into the

444
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,899
report that I submitted for the contest

445
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,520
but realistically in a real life fishing

446
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,940
scenario you don't have that kind of

447
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,220
time you've got maybe hours and so if

448
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,140
you can dig into the brands presence

449
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,760
online and then kind of get a feel for

450
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,950
what their employees are like or how

451
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,080
they feel about the company within about

452
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,910
an hour - you should have a feel for

453
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,429
things that you can use to elicit

454
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:52,970
empathy or to become part of the tribe

455
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:56,180
of that company's employees like oh man

456
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,530
the break room is crap and those kind of

457
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:00,830
comments are going to help you kind of

458
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,990
empathize with them so yeah I mean

459
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,550
within a within a couple of hours you

460
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:11,660
should really be able to build something

461
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:13,690
that that will float yes I'll repeat the

462
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,690
question

463
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:22,879
do I have any good free resources to

464
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:26,000
help employees recognize these types of

465
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,390
attacks there is a ton of free

466
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,490
information on the interwebs I would say

467
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,570
the first thing that comes to my mind

468
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,030
for a company that shares information

469
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:37,340
for free would be probably know before

470
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:40,340
but then of course social dassit -

471
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:44,149
engineer Chris had Nike shop they do

472
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:47,169
share a lot about recognizing these kind

473
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:49,820
of threats and attacks online for free

474
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,650
at YouTube like Google social

475
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:56,470
engineering and there's a ton of

476
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:59,720
resources when I started actually

477
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:02,060
attempting to compete in SC CTF a couple

478
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,040
years back I really struggled to find

479
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,330
information on how to build a pretext

480
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,620
and I was like how the heck am I going

481
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,919
to do this I don't know who I'm supposed

482
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,629
to be or how I'm

483
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,010
to be that person and that's really the

484
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,020
reason why I've put this talk together

485
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,150
to help people that do assessments but

486
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,760
also that can be really translated in to

487
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:20,490
training employees how to protect

488
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,530
themselves like stop commenting with

489
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,450
private information on your default and

490
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,850
your cover pictures stop letting your

491
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,190
images on Instagram you geo-located to

492
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,889
your company you're just making it too

493
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,240
easy for people to find out these kind

494
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:45,260
of things about you and about where you

495
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:48,840
work that it for questions looks like

496
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:51,050
