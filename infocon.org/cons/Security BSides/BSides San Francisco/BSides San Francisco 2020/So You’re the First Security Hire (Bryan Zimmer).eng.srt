1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,370
please join me in welcoming Brian from

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:12,450
whom ooh so Who am I this one goes out

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,889
to all the dr. Seuss fans in the

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,450
audience at the far out of town where

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,130
the Grieco grass grows I began my career

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,470
in security protecting ones and zeros

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,788
back in 2002 before cyber was a thing

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,470
and clouds were just something about

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,820
what you might sing from the Department

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,349
of Defense to banks and universities

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,890
then on to Netflix to get paid to watch

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,779
movies

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,340
I led Netflix's implementation of Xero

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,320
trust for which most people think beyond

15
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,940
Corpse a must now sit back and get comfy

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,230
I'll spin you a yarn of how to use one

17
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,629
pair of hands to protect your business

18
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,629
from harm oh thank you

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,870
so what have you gotten yourself into

20
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,919
let's say you're taking over a security

21
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,269
program we're starting the security

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,980
program from scratch of a small company

23
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,270
or maybe a security engineer leveling up

24
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,430
maybe your manager whose role is

25
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,020
expanded or maybe you're the poor IT guy

26
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,570
or girl that drew the short straw so

27
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,940
first congratulations also second I'm

28
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,230
sorry so on the plus side you get to do

29
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,149
things from scratch quote-unquote do it

30
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,230
the right way but just remember that the

31
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,609
right way is very subjective so two

32
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,959
years from now people could be looking

33
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,799
back and think well what idiot did this

34
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,350
and you'll have to own up and say oh

35
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,970
sorry that was me be ready to wear many

36
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,048
hats at a startup you're definitely

37
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,880
gonna do ton of different roles

38
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,470
definitely outside of securities so

39
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,699
don't don't scope your role too narrowly

40
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,560
at first it'll definitely narrow

41
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,420
naturally over time for example I'm kind

42
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,400
of Handy so I spent a lot of time fixing

43
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,780
coffee machine luckily now we have a

44
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,729
third party that does that

45
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,049
let's see ideally you're not gonna want

46
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,130
to be just a heads down security

47
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,979
engineer you're definitely to need those

48
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,298
skills but you also want critical social

49
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,380
skills shall we say because you're gonna

50
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,240
be interacting with a lot of different

51
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,679
teams around the company engineering IT

52
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,210
legal sales leadership ideally so

53
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,530
remember that you're not just setting up

54
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,908
security controls and all the techie

55
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,040
stuff you definitely have to start

56
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,180
setting security culture how do you want

57
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,590
your security team to interact with

58
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,939
people how do you want them to interact

59
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,759
with you how do you want security to be

60
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,949
valued in the company so why do you

61
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,259
exist as the wu-tang clan says cream or

62
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,729
cash rules everything around me you need

63
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,740
to help that the business get that dolla

64
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,969
dolla bill y'all so the three most

65
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,309
important things I do for the business

66
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,839
are making sure we don't get hacked

67
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,070
dealing with compliance and filling out

68
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,420
secured incoming security questionnaires

69
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,549
they all either directly or indirectly

70
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,140
bring in money so you're either winning

71
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,030
customers are you closing those deals

72
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,179
your media legal requirements to stay in

73
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,400
business or your

74
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,719
keeping the lights on and by the way

75
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,980
just because I didn't directly bring

76
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,180
money always remember to protect your

77
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,760
customers data because it's the right

78
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,620
thing to do keep in mind that you're an

79
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,000
advisor you're not the police people the

80
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,859
people can in the business can take your

81
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,760
advice or just leave it you need to

82
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:29,829
understand what's important for the

83
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,149
business and not just you so maybe you

84
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:33,129
have an urgent phone to fix or maybe

85
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,689
gotten shiny a new tool to buy but the

86
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:36,819
business might weigh the risk benefit

87
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:38,078
and cost benefit and say and it's really

88
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:40,328
not worth it sorry you have to be okay

89
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,920
with that and move on you might think

90
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:43,420
steered you to start but really that big

91
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,189
of a deal because we're too small to get

92
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,418
attacked but no there's I mean as we

93
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:47,980
know there spray-and-pray attacks but

94
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:49,870
also even just on LinkedIn there's

95
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,548
plenty of information to launch spear

96
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,780
phishing attacks against you we've seen

97
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,609
that definitely we're a small company

98
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,870
depending on your customer data and the

99
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:59,469
industry you're in you may start getting

100
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:02,079
more targeted attacks from I like to put

101
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:04,090
out the equation of startup - security

102
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,799
equals easy money for attackers because

103
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,389
you're gonna space you're gonna face all

104
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,129
the same attacks like ransomware

105
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:10,659
extortion data theft all the sort of

106
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,399
stuff that the big companies do but

107
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:13,510
attackers know that you do not have a

108
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,349
security team or maybe if you're lucky

109
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:19,209
one person so strategy the first part

110
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,709
here so first step is finding a company

111
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,120
with management support security you

112
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:23,859
definitely need buy-in from the top to

113
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,889
get anything done otherwise you are

114
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:28,269
gonna start crying very soon ask you

115
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:29,379
know during the interview process start

116
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,849
asking some questions like who's the

117
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:32,409
position report to can you talk to CEO

118
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,540
about your strategy what's the budget

119
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:36,489
what's the timeline for like how big

120
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,569
does the team want to get and and what

121
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,159
are the goals and what's the timeline

122
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:40,000
that sort of thing because you're trying

123
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,108
to figure out are they trying to check a

124
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,359
box for security or do they actually

125
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:44,799
deeply care about security ideally the

126
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,389
company wants to start caring about

127
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,099
security early because as we all know

128
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:49,329
bolting on security at the end for

129
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,409
either the business or the product is

130
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,019
going to take a lot more time and effort

131
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:55,989
and money example would be like see

132
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:58,120
becoming see see see CPA and JP are

133
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:59,500
compliant trying to both those features

134
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,019
onto a product after the fact are gonna

135
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,189
be a big huge pain and then before

136
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:05,229
putting in the controls and processes

137
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:06,970
and procedures always ask why so take a

138
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:08,560
step back and think okay well what are

139
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,269
we trying to do here so what's the

140
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,739
reason behind it how will it actually

141
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,000
benefit us is there a new or a better

142
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,109
way to do it which is one of the

143
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,238
benefits of starting from scratch you

144
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:17,500
can you can do that so for example

145
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,909
traditionally people have said you know

146
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,738
hey we need a crazy long passwords that

147
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,728
are rotated every 90 days but then you

148
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:23,409
take a step back and you realize oh

149
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,940
actually we can take care of this issue

150
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:26,650
and we can take care of a bunch of

151
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,990
different attacks account takeover stuff

152
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,659
but just by requiring more memorable

153
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,949
passwords but 2fa you know you might

154
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,120
traditionally buy fancy was paying

155
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,010
firewall with a bunch of security

156
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,570
features I won't mention names but then

157
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,190
you take a step back and you realize oh

158
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,479
actually we can solve all these problems

159
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,460
and eliminate a whole bunch of other

160
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,250
problems by going with the encore and

161
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:48,099
just a simple firewall so now on to the

162
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,840
strategy or the the tote the the meat of

163
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,520
the strategy if you or the tofu if you

164
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,349
prefer if this Chromebook would scroll

165
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,880
oh there we go

166
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,410
so you've got one pair of hands so how

167
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,969
do you make sure that you are spending

168
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,530
your limited amount of time on the most

169
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,539
critical things so I've created one

170
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,049
simple you need to remember acronym

171
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:05,949
there for you first part is finding what

172
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,510
matters most to the business the

173
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:09,010
valuables the crown jewels talk to the

174
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,080
the founders the heads of each group

175
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,729
what data applications process this

176
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,260
procedures matter most to the to the

177
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,449
company into things like customer data

178
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,280
intellectual property bank accounts you

179
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,110
know internal apps blah blah blah blah

180
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,820
blah and then find what laws you have to

181
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,020
comply with and certifications that the

182
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,550
business's wants in addition to those

183
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,930
legal requirements that's going to

184
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,160
determine determine what frameworks you

185
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,350
have to use what controls you're gonna

186
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,400
put in place policies and generally how

187
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,680
fast and loose you can play with

188
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,849
security dealing with compliance might

189
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,289
be one of the reasons one of the big

190
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,760
reasons why your position was created in

191
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:39,639
the first place so a lot of people hate

192
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,860
to admit that but there will likely be

193
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,389
some some compliance parts of your job

194
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,680
my recommendation is outsource as much

195
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,900
of the compliance stuff as you can like

196
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,720
GAAP assessments and audits and getting

197
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,679
policies but realize you're still gonna

198
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,260
be doing a bunch of the heavy lifting

199
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,760
putting that in place and then find out

200
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,110
what level of risk the business is

201
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,340
comfortable accepting so getting a

202
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,780
general feel from the co founders like

203
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,039
do they want to move faster and accept

204
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,169
more risk or do they want to go move a

205
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,300
little more slowly and dot all the i's

206
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,680
and cross all the t's some basic

207
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,180
examples would be you know if there's a

208
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,560
medium risk of exposing customer data

209
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,840
with this new feature but the new

210
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,919
feature is gonna close a giant deal you

211
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,479
know do they want to move forward with

212
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,669
that or do they want to fix the issue

213
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,440
first before moving on or do you block

214
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,909
installation of software on employees

215
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,340
laptops or do you trust them to use

216
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,840
their best judgment and and let them

217
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,789
install whatever they want or do you

218
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,210
have air gap systems free most sensitive

219
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:29,440
a slight tangent here related to risk

220
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,909
third party risk do you really know

221
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,190
where your data is so you might think

222
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,479
you have a small AWS and GCV or GCP

223
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,330
footprint but your data could be going

224
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,909
to all kinds of places thanks to G suite

225
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,449
plug-ins slack plugins Chrome extensions

226
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,340
all that sort of

227
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:43,539
so I recommend turning on a lot

228
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,739
whitelisting from the beginning so you

229
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:46,180
can start getting a handle on this sort

230
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,379
of stuff especially things that have

231
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,300
access to G Drive because that's where a

232
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,639
ton of sensitive business information is

233
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,870
these days definitely don't take more

234
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,889
than like a day to answer those requests

235
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,150
otherwise you're gonna be holding up the

236
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,229
business which pisses off a lot of

237
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,448
people which I'll go into a little bit

238
00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:00,878
later and then take an inventory of

239
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:02,229
applications and and integrations try to

240
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,430
gather some security information on them

241
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,628
good luck if you're a small company and

242
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,150
trying to get any sort of response out

243
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,469
of security at whatever company calm and

244
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,938
then create a basic risk spreadsheet so

245
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,680
you can track your assets and your risk

246
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:13,930
I do something basic like likelihood of

247
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,610
compromised times impact / remediation

248
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,289
effectiveness equals your risk just a

249
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,389
good basic idea you can get fancy or

250
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:21,068
something like cbss if you want remember

251
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,110
that third party and subprocessor

252
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:24,370
inventory is kind of important for GDP R

253
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,599
and C CPA you definitely need to know

254
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,610
where your data is going and who your

255
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,169
sub processors are back to little more

256
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,150
the strategy threats so finding your

257
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,258
your cyber threats and ideally your

258
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,719
physical threats as well you can use

259
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:36,550
miters attack framework for some ideas

260
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,870
you can also use Verizon's D bi report

261
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,639
shout out to Alex Pinto I know you're in

262
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,889
the audience riding a capybara somewhere

263
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,990
and then you can use this CB SS for

264
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:45,939
ranking them unauthorized access to data

265
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,189
data being held ransom using trusted

266
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:49,810
access to access your customer or attack

267
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:50,379
your customers those those are some of

268
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,879
the big ones

269
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:53,169
talk to the co-founders and get their

270
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,270
input see if they agree with you see if

271
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:56,680
they've got some other ideas see what

272
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,120
are the biggest threats next you're

273
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,199
gonna start setting culture because

274
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,729
security isn't just about technology

275
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,499
it's definitely the people - I'll get

276
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,568
more into that in a couple slides and

277
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:06,009
then good security culture makes it

278
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:07,839
easier to integrate into the business

279
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,370
start building trust and getting into

280
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,979
those important teams and workflows and

281
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,810
I'll get more into that too in a second

282
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:16,270
and the last part of the strategy here

283
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:19,749
so then comes every engineers favorite

284
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,799
part the policies you might be able to

285
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,939
actually skip these if you're lucky if

286
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,589
you don't have a bunch of laws and

287
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:25,270
certifications to comply with but you

288
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:26,499
may actually have large customers that

289
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,599
the man do you have certifications so

290
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:29,620
you're back to square one I recommend

291
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,748
getting templates from whoever you're

292
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,159
outsourcing compliance to also if you

293
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:34,389
want to go the cheap route which might

294
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,948
take a little more effort you can go to

295
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,360
most universities websites all their

296
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,899
policies are typically public work

297
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,370
smarter not harder harder copy and paste

298
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,690
and let's see then - of course tweak

299
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,130
them to fit your business so do you

300
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,420
really need that 10 page password policy

301
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,279
or you can just go with you know a

302
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,199
paragraph you don't really need to go

303
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,370
crazy and then lastly you start putting

304
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:52,540
the controls in place this is where all

305
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,790
of us engineering types are most

306
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,680
comfortable so

307
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,290
things like 2fa anti-malware inventory

308
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,640
access control yada yada yada you're

309
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,599
gonna select those controls based on

310
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,250
these inputs you've gotten in the

311
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,660
previous steps and select what's right

312
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,460
for the business so you know you're

313
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,020
probably not gonna have three FA on an

314
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,240
air-gap network with you're just selling

315
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,290
cad emojis so keep it simple that's one

316
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,330
of my guiding principles that I'll go

317
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,740
into in a minute and then iterate put

318
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,660
the basics in place and then improve as

319
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,850
you go along so if you haven't been in a

320
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,110
small company before you might be most

321
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,800
comfortable with like hey I need to get

322
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,150
this done 100% right the first time but

323
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,069
you're gonna realize that you know

324
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,209
you're gonna want to get like 80% there

325
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,200
at a startup cuz you're gonna be moving

326
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,390
in tons of directions with one pair of

327
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,760
hands and then come back and finish the

328
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,270
20% later remember that perfect is the

329
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,700
enemy the good guiding principles so

330
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,780
guardrails not gates is a saying I got

331
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,490
from Jason Shannon from my time at

332
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,630
Netflix so people hate hearing no it

333
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,280
definitely gets in their way prevents

334
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,810
them from doing their job yeah you

335
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,220
become a source of their anger so they

336
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,540
won't want to come work with you again

337
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,800
they'll definitely try to go around you

338
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,360
so don't hold up the business unless

339
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,650
it's something critical let people get

340
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,180
their jobs done and like I said you're

341
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,579
here to serve as an advisor you're not

342
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,569
the military and be wanted not feared

343
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,100
you know do you want to be this feared

344
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,570
security person or do you want to the

345
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,770
one that people love to work with which

346
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,170
one is going to get better results for

347
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,850
you definitely create an approachable

348
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,469
and positive security culture people are

349
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,820
gonna want to bring you their questions

350
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,170
and issues rather than you having to go

351
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,740
and dig them up which takes a lot a lot

352
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,880
more time

353
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,530
I'll go into that in a little bit and

354
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,960
then keep it simple like I mentioned

355
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:18,390
here so complex policies and procedures

356
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,580
are gonna be hard to maintain and there

357
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,750
we go scroll and they're definitely

358
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,300
gonna invite people to the point of

359
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,650
going around them so choose short

360
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,089
policies she's paying the security

361
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,829
reviews choose platforms of service

362
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,230
choose erode trust choose life choose

363
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,430
Trainspotting references keep it simple

364
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,600
and you're gonna remove an entire class

365
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,859
of security concerns like

366
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,360
platform-as-a-service has almost no

367
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,180
infrastructure to administer remained

368
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,080
IRB's insecure zero trust is gonna you

369
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,810
know eliminate a bunch of traditional

370
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,490
network security architecture and and

371
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,040
network security concerns so you've got

372
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,870
one pair hands so let AWS and GCP take

373
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,250
care of all those old school security

374
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,690
issues for you shameless plug for

375
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,330
minding my talk from a couple years ago

376
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,800
on zero trust and it flicks and then

377
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,900
make people self reliance so they can be

378
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,310
your hands your hand or sorry your eyes

379
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,770
and ears because you can't be everywhere

380
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,900
at once so give them the tools you know

381
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,370
to be on that paved path that's inside

382
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,900
the guardrails and the education to use

383
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,130
them because you won't

384
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,569
have the time de birria around and be

385
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,350
involved in every single security

386
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:12,300
decision

387
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,920
let me start getting the culture here

388
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,420
how well you integrate into the business

389
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,949
is Howie

390
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,880
well you integrate security into the

391
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,890
business is gonna depend on the

392
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,170
principles you set like the also the

393
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,029
culture and how your you and your future

394
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,410
team interact with people so be

395
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:26,550
transparent you know if you're gonna

396
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,660
install something on someone's laptop

397
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,949
the first thing they're gonna be like

398
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,839
what's what's going on here you've

399
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,220
spying on me it's like no we're this

400
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,660
thing is gonna catch malware for you

401
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,400
it's gonna it's gonna protect you

402
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,660
there's literally no way can spy on you

403
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,850
here's the manual if you want to double

404
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,290
check just having some some rapport with

405
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,089
the person showing them what's going on

406
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,819
and and being transparent on your

407
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:48,180
decisions I appreciate people so say

408
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,529
thank you it's simple but it goes a long

409
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,510
way just hearing thank you in the office

410
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:52,790
really goes really improves a lot of

411
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,500
things like a relationship with people

412
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,180
you know what I do is if someone that

413
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,680
has helped improve security some way or

414
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,719
they report a good phishing attack or

415
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,579
whatever I give a security shark award

416
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,960
at our All Hands meetings so it's like a

417
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,970
Amazon gift certificate I'll say hey

418
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,589
person X did this thank you very much

419
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,089
and give them a little reward gets gets

420
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:10,470
the word out there keep security in

421
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:12,540
people's minds and also says thank you

422
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:13,740
to the person and be humble so no one

423
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,969
works no one wants to work with a

424
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,400
brilliant jerk we've all worked with

425
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,170
brilliant jerks I do jujitsu and it's

426
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,430
taught me many things most importantly

427
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,050
is that you're gonna learn of course

428
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,359
from people above you and you know your

429
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,680
peers probably ideally but you're also

430
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,029
gonna learn from people below you so

431
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,380
treat everyone with respect to treat

432
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:31,020
everyone as a pro that you can learn

433
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,029
something from you know say like hey

434
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,650
this area is not my area of expertise

435
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:35,880
can you teach can you teach me how

436
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,410
something about this and we can work

437
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
together on this issue it's exactly what

438
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,410
I did with some apps egg phones we had I

439
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,700
can barely spell apps X so I went to our

440
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,050
head engineer was like hey we've got

441
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,370
this issue can you explain it to me can

442
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,719
we work together like how can we fix

443
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,160
this and the two of us worked on it

444
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,940
together which goes much better than

445
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,829
just like hey fix this for me feedback

446
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,450
so you can't improve and you definitely

447
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,279
should want to improve so you can't

448
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,870
improve in a vacuum ask people for

449
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,950
feedback see the conversation with

450
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,029
examples like hey we just rolled out

451
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,020
this tool would you think about it or

452
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,580
we're gonna do this what you think about

453
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,260
that or in this meeting I said this did

454
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,810
I sound like a jackass what do you think

455
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,220
how can i how can I improve empathy so

456
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,329
always assume good intent you know

457
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,209
people are just trying to get their jobs

458
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,950
done you know some traditional security

459
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:18,119
person might hear like oh hey person

460
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,230
comes up to you and says I need an FTP

461
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,590
server right now like I need to transfer

462
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,510
this file and you might go whoa

463
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:24,520
head explode but no take take a step

464
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,750
back and realize okay let's dig in a

465
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,010
little bit this person's trying to get

466
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,690
their job done okay they have this

467
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,100
important file for the CEO or whoever

468
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,450
they need to transfer it now they just

469
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,220
didn't realize that we've got a paved

470
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,960
path here to like get this transferred

471
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,970
security and quick it's securely and

472
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,620
quickly or maybe they don't have an

473
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,910
option right now so then you come up you

474
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,560
work with them to come up with a more

475
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,560
secure solution so I always assume good

476
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:47,079
intent the little things speak English

477
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,119
not techie either couple these points

478
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,410
were in some of the other talks as well

479
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,460
it definitely alienates people if you're

480
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,410
going to talk about the lithium crystals

481
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,300
and rotating your cables every hundred

482
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,199
thousand packets that sort of thing you

483
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,099
know if you're talking to legal they're

484
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,970
gonna be like what in the hell are you

485
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,730
talking about they're not gonna want to

486
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,320
come back and talk to you again so

487
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,990
tailor your your level of techie to the

488
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,180
audience and say hi in the hallway make

489
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,160
eye contact just basic interpersonal

490
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,109
skills I mean not just on your team but

491
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,750
like random people in the office it

492
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,360
definitely improves the the culture and

493
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:20,350
it helps get you get you integrated into

494
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,660
the company let's see and also try it

495
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,800
out in the real world it's nice and then

496
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,150
last thing on security culture is

497
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,620
setting the elevator back down so use

498
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,150
your position of power at the top to

499
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,190
help out others below you we're never

500
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,360
gonna increase diversity or fill hiring

501
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,710
gaps if you don't get out they like

502
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,450
spend some effort trying to get out

503
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,620
there finding women of minorities who

504
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,630
either work with you or outside the

505
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,890
office interns recent college graduates

506
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,390
we're trying to start their careers

507
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,160
invite them to conversations and

508
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,449
projects and write them to industry

509
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,500
events try to help them try to help them

510
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,180
build their network give them career

511
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,470
advice high school teachers definitely

512
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,130
need people to come talk and inspire

513
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,020
their students

514
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,090
you can skip fancy universities people

515
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,960
at community colleges high schools and

516
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,580
poor school districts are gonna

517
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,850
definitely appreciate it and use it a

518
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,810
lot more integrating the companies

519
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,310
socialize so start building

520
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,650
relationships and trust across the

521
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,060
business you know you you're gonna need

522
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,069
to work with engineering for production

523
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,069
type stuff IT for malware and corporate

524
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,940
type stuff legal for contract review

525
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,860
sales for incoming Security

526
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,120
questionnaires go talk the sales team

527
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,940
and ask how many deals if you we lost

528
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,900
because we didn't have security thing X

529
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,800
and that'll show that you're trying to

530
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,150
help out the security team you can also

531
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,170
take that number to leadership and say

532
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,790
hey we need to spend a bunch of money

533
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,300
and here's one of the reasons why we've

534
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,750
you know

535
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,599
trade-off of cost there times really

536
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:30,520
running out and then find that the major

537
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,930
stakeholders and the team leaders meet

538
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,280
with them regularly over lunch and

539
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,339
one-on-ones and then try to build a

540
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,309
relationship you like I talk

541
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:39,379
about increasing visibility so you want

542
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:41,689
to find the security issues and also

543
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:43,730
keep yourself visible in the eyes of the

544
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:45,319
rest of the company so you know have new

545
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,730
employee security training yearly

546
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,410
security training developer security

547
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,029
training go to the other teams all hands

548
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,079
it's like a fly on the wall to keep your

549
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:52,550
finger on the pulse and hear what's

550
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:53,779
going on security related there of

551
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,859
course don't over communicate because

552
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,300
people are gonna because people are

553
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,889
gonna get alert fatigue and just start

554
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,209
ignoring you after a while and remember

555
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:00,410
to tailor the content to the specific

556
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,518
audience don't blast out email to the

557
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,769
entire company if it only applies to

558
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,180
half the company and then recruit people

559
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:06,470
on the other teams who are interested in

560
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,878
securities to be your to be your eyes

561
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,550
and ears and potentially hands to help

562
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:11,300
you fix issues and report things

563
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,378
collaborate don't be a dictator don't

564
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,240
just throw stuff over the fence like I

565
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:15,709
mentioned earlier it's gonna go much

566
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,790
better if you could say hey how can we

567
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:19,640
work on this together rather than just

568
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,889
like here please fix this problem

569
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,480
[Music]

570
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:25,459
engagement so we all know security is a

571
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,629
dry topic like hey pick a strong

572
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:28,339
password don't share your password don't

573
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:30,949
do this don't do that I like to get

574
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:33,019
creative make a little fun here's the

575
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:34,519
security shark award that I hand out

576
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:37,160
with the Amazon gift certificate at the

577
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,860
All Hands meetings when I was at Netflix

578
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,839
did some security education posters

579
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,220
around the office in October this one

580
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,389
was pushing password managers who

581
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,480
doesn't love hedgehogs the head of legal

582
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:49,610
said she loved this one also two-factor

583
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,850
off I know somebody here was attending

584
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:55,459
had an icon of a sloth thank you

585
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,649
and then a little last one or a couple

586
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,449
more slides our white elephant Christmas

587
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,920
party a couple years ago my contribution

588
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,969
for the gift pile was a picture of

589
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,699
myself which people thought was

590
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,220
hilarious until I told them that there

591
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,209
was a hidden gift card in there so they

592
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,439
did the trading and then eventually

593
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,120
pulled apart they didn't find a gift

594
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,319
card so what they did they took awhile

595
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,510
but they eventually found out if you

596
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,918
held the picture over heat source the

597
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,109
Amazon gift card was written in lemon

598
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,970
juice and then it appeared the CEO loved

599
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:21,139
that so much that he now hides this

600
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,909
picture regularly around the office with

601
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,770
another card hidden in it a coffee card

602
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,449
and then if you find it you get to hide

603
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,859
it for the next person people love that

604
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,620
so much that they took my picture and

605
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:33,350
then put it on put on t-shirts for our

606
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,580
one of our Halloween costume competition

607
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,629
things and on the back you'll see

608
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,250
there's a bunch of letters and if you

609
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,429
unscramble that you found out where the

610
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,710
prize was now I have a picture a write

611
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:44,059
up a t-shirt with my picture on it which

612
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,039
is weird

613
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:48,200
anyway I love wearing it around it's

614
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:50,600
great make me look famous or something

615
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,519
and last thing oh good I think it's

616
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,570
gonna work out physical security why

617
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:54,980
would you care about physical security

618
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,320
you know maybe you want to learn

619
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,450
something new you know really who else

620
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,740
is gonna do it at startup so there's a

621
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,789
lot of similarities with InfoSec so

622
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,590
you've got badges and doors for

623
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:06,289
authentication and access controls you

624
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,939
got cameras facing ideally out the

625
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:09,230
external doors for after the fact

626
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,269
monitoring Remer do not face the cameras

627
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,320
in that tends to creep people out and

628
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:13,820
likely you're not gonna have alarms

629
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,230
because ideally people are taking their

630
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,668
laptops homes at home at the end of the

631
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,779
day you've gotta be on Corp Network so

632
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:21,080
if someone does plug into your network

633
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:23,029
whatever that's nice and then you know

634
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,100
people also forget to set alarms anyway

635
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:28,190
so they're kind of useless yes sir thank

636
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,449
you and then other things you know like

637
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,490
you're only gonna have to worry about

638
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,899
theft for really the first few years but

639
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,220
as you get bigger you might want to

640
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:35,809
start investing in guards and there

641
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,700
could be domestic violence issues is one

642
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:41,620
of the big ones that comes up targeted

643
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,789
attacks higher you know as you is your

644
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,049
leadership gets higher profile maybe

645
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,299
attacks against them that sort of stuff

646
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:49,010
you know I've heard of things like teams

647
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:50,389
of doing international extractions on

648
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:51,740
like big physical security teams but

649
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:53,209
don't worry about that really all you

650
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,250
have to worry about his theft keeping

651
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:58,070
the doors locked and then auditors to

652
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,659
satisfy cameras to satisfy the auditors

653
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,629
and potentially like tracking down what

654
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:04,010
got stolen and I went a little fast

655
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,049
because we lost some time with filling

656
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,840
the theater but I think I got in under

657
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:10,760
the wire I don't think I have any time

658
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,269
for questions but I'll take softball

659
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,010
