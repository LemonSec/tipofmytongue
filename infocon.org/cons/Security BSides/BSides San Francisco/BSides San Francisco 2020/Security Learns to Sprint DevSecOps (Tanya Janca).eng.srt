1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,039
hello everybody welcome in thank you for

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,950
coming in today we have a really cool

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,540
talk by Tanya she's also known as she

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,209
hacks purple she's an independent

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,279
security consultant specializing in

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,109
software and cloud security so please

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:27,720
give her your all your attention and

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:29,849
focus while she gives their top hi okay

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,549
hi everyone thank you for coming I am

10
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,010
Tanya Jenkins day we're gonna talk about

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,800
how security needs to adjust ourselves

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,360
in order to fit in with DevOps

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,730
because otherwise they'll just sprint

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,550
away from us and keep doing DevOps

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,078
without us and we don't want that so a

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,510
lot of what we're going to talk about is

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,820
how security is everybody's job and how

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,760
as security professionals it's our job

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,030
to enable every single other person to

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,530
do their job securely and so I made the

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,210
sticker at one of my offices so that

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,859
everyone could be reminded all the time

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,769
and have the little raccoon stare at

24
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,930
them I mean help them okay so the

25
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,840
mandatory okay so where we going to talk

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,500
about DevOps security becoming a part of

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,640
DevOps which I like to call dev sec UPS

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,150
please feel free to fight with me about

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,229
it later on Twitter and this is how some

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,640
people see security in DevOps is how

31
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,280
some security people see it but that's

32
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,829
not what I see this is what I see I see

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,840
us and dealing developers and ops folks

34
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:34,589
to creating more secure software quicker

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,570
and ahead of all of our competitors this

36
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,729
is what I see and so let's talk about

37
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,619
that okay so the mandatory about me

38
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,679
slide this is the we are qualified to

39
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,360
give our own talk slide we do this so

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,130
that you stay the whole time but you

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,049
already waited in line so I assume

42
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,579
you're gonna stay so I'm a giant nerd I

43
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,729
do all the things and I just start

44
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,679
giving training on the Internet yay so I

45
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,420
do lots of stuff I love o ASP I will

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,759
talk about them incessantly if you let

47
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,490
me all right

48
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:05,280
okay so let's do this so first of all

49
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,818
definitions what is app sec besides my

50
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,730
favorite topic it is every and any

51
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,940
activity that you do to make sure your

52
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,570
software is more secure

53
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,609
right so that could be I'm doing a code

54
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,230
review specifically to make sure that

55
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,390
there's no security vulnerabilities but

56
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,010
it could also be knowing that there's

57
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,750
this old function that now has a

58
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,850
vulnerability in it and you want to not

59
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,640
allow it anymore so you just rep through

60
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,950
your source code find and replace it am

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,510
I am I going like way out of the line of

62
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,310
the camera I didn't think to ask about

63
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,269
that anyway okay I'll try to stay still

64
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:42,550
okay other problems poor application

65
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,710
security is a big problem we have been

66
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:49,330
the winner according to the Verizon data

67
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:52,090
breach report 2016 2017 2018 and spoiler

68
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:55,240
alert 2019 we have been the number one

69
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,310
cause of breaches in secure software so

70
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,950
that's very expensive and very bad I'm

71
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,330
sure you all know that but until I did

72
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,549
this research I was like oh god we're

73
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,830
actually the worst so we're doing the

74
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,720
worst job in security okay

75
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,930
so we have work to do okay so also

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,730
application security is missing most

77
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,560
people who have gone to school have told

78
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,060
me they have had almost no security

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,580
training or if they did have security

80
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,680
training the training that they got was

81
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,810
not enough so they took computer science

82
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,850
but they got nothing on secure coding

83
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,820
all they got was this is what identity

84
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:30,010
is use Azure Active Directory and that's

85
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,950
it there's so much more to writing

86
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,480
secure software than that

87
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,130
so Security's also hope numbered see her

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,660
she's all alone and sad by herself

89
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,640
that's me

90
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,079
on my app sect team I'm just like it's

91
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,420
just me and then there's hundreds and

92
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,600
hundreds of lovely developers who I feel

93
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,549
overwhelmed by right so being

94
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,320
outnumbered means we can't just work

95
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,780
harder we have to work smarter

96
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,609
these are apparently the statistics in

97
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,760
our industry I've never worked somewhere

98
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,959
where my odds were that good I have

99
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,230
never worked somewhere where there were

100
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,680
only 10 - ops people and only 100

101
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:08,679
developers for me for each one of me so

102
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,980
I want to improve this but for now let's

103
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,380
talk about that one person just doing a

104
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,670
more effective job ok so the last thing

105
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,750
on this I'm going to talk a little bit

106
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:23,509
about water feel sorry waterfall um

107
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:25,940
the security model for waterfall totally

108
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:27,710
stinks it's not working and that's why a

109
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,330
lot of companies are all moving towards

110
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,159
the DevOps model because it gets

111
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,508
suffered at the door software that's

112
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,370
more resilient software that's higher

113
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:37,819
quality software there are clients like

114
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,800
better our customers love and we need to

115
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,330
get on board with this so that we can

116
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,800
make sure that all of those things are

117
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,690
revolve around a product that's also

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,090
secure boom so what does step set cops

119
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:52,130
so my friend Imran Mohammed who is this

120
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,090
awesome dude who he's like Tanya it's

121
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,180
what we've always done

122
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,979
it's just that SEC except for in a

123
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,750
devops environment it's just that's like

124
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,070
changing stuff around he's like that's

125
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,710
what you do everywhere you work every

126
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,719
place you work they do application

127
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,120
development slightly differently and you

128
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,789
just adjust to make sure that this stuff

129
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,500
is just the same except it's DevOps it's

130
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:17,318
like you make it sound really easy and

131
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:20,780
mom okay so now let's talk about DevOps

132
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,849
who here feels super brave and wants to

133
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,210
tell me one of the main three goals of

134
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:31,880
DevOps anyone feels super brave today

135
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:38,659
you're at B sides yes anyone else want

136
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:42,880
to feel brave Oh what did oh sorry

137
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:48,409
he said more deployments like faster

138
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:53,030
deployments continuous feedback yes also

139
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:54,710
faster time-to-market also increasing

140
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,849
the efficiency of the entire system not

141
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,830
just your part getting things to market

142
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:02,419
faster than your competitors that's like

143
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,198
the end of that sentence so these are

144
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:09,409
these are the main goals and let's talk

145
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:12,889
about them employed improve deployment

146
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:16,070
frequency thank you sir so as I have to

147
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:18,919
do a security it means you can fix my

148
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,440
security bugs now I worked somewhere

149
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:23,630
once and I kid you not their deployment

150
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,990
frequency or like once you ask for

151
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,990
something to it being deployed with 16

152
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,990
months

153
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,190
they explained that my absolute

154
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,680
emergency the sky is falling change

155
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:40,990
could absolutely with lots of overtime

156
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,180
be completed in four months um Laura

157
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,680
fill your rates so I feel this one's

158
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,870
really obvious but let's talk about it

159
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,009
so a lot of people talk about resiliency

160
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,780
that's why a lot of people move to the

161
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:52,120
cloud they don't want things to not fall

162
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,888
down but who remembers this from school

163
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,590
or maybe not from school but who

164
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,770
remembers this the CIA triad if we look

165
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,869
back at here

166
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,520
resiliency means if it's always up it's

167
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,960
always available and that means your

168
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,039
customers can always go to your site and

169
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,690
you don't have something embarrassing

170
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:13,599
instead like a stack trace so that is

171
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,430
where that relates to security and is in

172
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,080
line with the same goals and then the

173
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,300
last one faster time-to-market

174
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,099
I bet love you were thinking like that

175
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,699
has nothing to do with security guess

176
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:26,530
what if we don't get to market quickly

177
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,349
we don't like create products that

178
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,359
delight our customers we go out of

179
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:31,870
business and then there is no security

180
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,719
team

181
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,940
I might sound ridiculous but like it is

182
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:38,740
our job as security professionals to

183
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,330
enable everyone else and I have worked

184
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,460
at a lot of places where the security

185
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:47,409
team was the number one risk to

186
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:50,770
availability and so we don't win if the

187
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:53,169
business doesn't win all right so this

188
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,508
is so I love a wasp I talk about a lot

189
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,669
all the time and all my talks and in my

190
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,560
opinion DevOps is the best thing to

191
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:02,409
happen to the security of software since

192
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,029
I ASP I wasp just for anyone that

193
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:06,250
doesn't know is the open web application

194
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:07,779
security project of a chapter here

195
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,580
there's chapters in almost all the

196
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:13,180
cities across America and all over the

197
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,568
world and I love alas but I don't like

198
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,990
it

199
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:19,169
I love I love my community and so this

200
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:22,810
is the highest praise I could give

201
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,909
anything so now let's talk about DevOps

202
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:29,050
in the three ways so I'm gonna explain

203
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:30,550
what DevOps is according to me and also

204
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,640
the DevOps handbook and the people that

205
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,979
invented DevOps so what are the three

206
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:40,479
ways of DevOps does anyone feel brave

207
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:41,630
again so there's someone up there

208
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,870
scratching his head and

209
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,000
thinking of trying to get him to answer

210
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,280
okay the three ways of DevOps the first

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,920
one is to increase the efficiency of the

212
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:55,370
entire system so if I make my part way

213
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,689
way way faster but then his parts still

214
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,930
slow and we're all still waiting on his

215
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,000
part I should have just been helping him

216
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:04,520
the second way is making sure we get

217
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,260
feedback as soon as we possibly can the

218
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,170
big thing with waterfall and my so many

219
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,210
projects failed is because we didn't get

220
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,189
feedback until after a year of

221
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,410
programming and then the customer is

222
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,930
like that's not what I meant and then

223
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,550
the last way of DevOps is continuous

224
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:24,800
learning experimentation risk-taking

225
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:26,359
which sounds scary but if you do in a

226
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,390
controlled way it can be really awesome

227
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,730
so let's look at this and we're going to

228
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,470
talk about each one of these basically

229
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,900
the rest the talk is just going to be me

230
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,910
presenting a billion different ideas in

231
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,310
each one of these three ways of how we

232
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,930
can add security to DevOps and then free

233
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:44,660
resources at the end because that's how

234
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,180
you end all my talks so emphasizing the

235
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,160
efficiency of the entire system

236
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:53,089
sometimes I call this left to right or

237
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:59,329
if you look at my amazing like I know

238
00:09:53,090 --> 00:10:00,890
right I'm so good at animation but the

239
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,070
idea is is that we want to get through

240
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:06,590
as quickly as possible

241
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,900
releasing our products so this means

242
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,990
security cannot be the bottleneck this

243
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,760
means we need to learn to sprint but

244
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,170
let's get into this a bit more so first

245
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,300
I'm going to talk about Devon ops and

246
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,579
then I'm gonna talk about security who

247
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:23,599
here does dev who here who here codes

248
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,620
for work awesome who here does ops and

249
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,270
by that I mean anything to do with

250
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,130
operations and making sure things keep

251
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:31,930
working okay and then who here does

252
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:34,970
security okay so not quite all the hands

253
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,459
by the end all you know all your hands

254
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,510
are gonna go out okay so where's this

255
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:43,370
MIA for Devon ops

256
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:45,500
it means we security folk need your help

257
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,420
we need your help tuning our tools to

258
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,100
make sure we don't waste your time we

259
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,510
need your help sometimes implementing

260
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,070
the tools we need you to give us

261
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,270
feedback like if a tool is giving you

262
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,910
false positives I want to know

263
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,110
immediately I don't want to hear through

264
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,910
someone through someone else through

265
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,970
someone else how you know I broke your

266
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:05,329
pipeline tell me so I can fix it please

267
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:07,400
I need your help to make unit tests so

268
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:12,920
that I can make negative unit tests I

269
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:15,350
made basically I need really big bugs to

270
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,459
break your build big security bugs need

271
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,020
to break your build so that's the

272
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,970
biggest thing I need I need you to not

273
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:24,560
just like go over that and publish

274
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,910
anyway so this is a photo slide I'm

275
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,219
gonna have seven of these throughout the

276
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,709
talk so I'm just gonna show you awesome

277
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,089
pictures of people working in tech while

278
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,620
I'm talking and then I'm going to show

279
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,270
you a photo slide after with a summary

280
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,040
so that you don't have to take notes

281
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,140
because I'm not great at taking notes

282
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,060
myself there's gonna be seven of these

283
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,410
this is number one I'm not going to give

284
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:47,119
you as much time on the other ones

285
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:50,180
because I have to be quick with the

286
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,160
cameras or watch the replay okay so what

287
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:56,479
does this mean for security specifically

288
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,890
most of us in this room we can't be the

289
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,470
bottleneck that's the number one thing

290
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,420
it means that we have to learn to do

291
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,730
sprints if the developers are doing

292
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,410
sprints we have to adjust ourselves for

293
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,630
what dev and ops are doing right now

294
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,520
Sprint's are the way and if they want to

295
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,020
release 20 times a day we have to figure

296
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,790
out how to work with that we can't say

297
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,740
to them like Oh we'd really like to do a

298
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,349
three-week code freeze that's nice you

299
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,480
can go code freeze by yourself because

300
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,250
they're not gonna wait for you and so we

301
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,310
need to focus on improving all the value

302
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:28,130
streams and quitting hours other things

303
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:30,380
that it means oh yeah making sure that

304
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:33,500
oh yeah there were more clicks here okay

305
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,120
but next other things it means are we

306
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,770
need to break our security activities

307
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,529
into smaller pieces so you could still

308
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:41,300
review code but you can't review like

309
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,890
the entire code and expect us to freeze

310
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,500
them wait for you I'm not kidding I've

311
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,990
worked places where I was on the dev

312
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,190
team and you know the security person is

313
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,440
like well we're gonna do this three week

314
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,670
code freeze in blah blah and then they

315
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,850
and I was like oh yeah of course they

316
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,439
left the room and then

317
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,690
team look at me I might know if I forget

318
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,009
that guy yeah we'll just keep coding

319
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,050
that way

320
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:03,269
it also means we need to tune our

321
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,889
security tools we cannot be giving false

322
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:07,620
positives we can not be breaking builds

323
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:09,300
for the wrong reasons and also we want

324
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,100
to provide templates whenever possible

325
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,389
so that we don't have to reinvent the

326
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,339
wheel so if you have done a whole bunch

327
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:16,230
of security testing on this one login

328
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,730
screen then everyone should just be

329
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,889
using like replicating that as a

330
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,600
template and then you test the main one

331
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,459
and then if there are bugs again then

332
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600
you push them out to all of the ones

333
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:29,040
that have been built from the template

334
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,870
this saves a lot of time and pain this

335
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,990
is photo site number two but don't worry

336
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:37,370
there's more for security in regards to

337
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:39,930
making your entire system a lot faster

338
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,630
so what else does this mean so you can

339
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,888
create more than one pipeline what so

340
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,019
you can have a pipeline that does all

341
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:48,029
the things and then goes out to prod but

342
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,860
you could if you want to you could have

343
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:51,600
it branch off somewhere and just do this

344
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,899
weird security pipeline that goes to

345
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,750
nowhere I call this the asynchronous

346
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:59,189
pipeline and then you can run your

347
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,079
gazillion line

348
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:04,199
static application security testing

349
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:06,689
thing you can run all of your slow tests

350
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:08,459
but it still goes out to prod and then

351
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:10,500
you can come in on Monday and see the

352
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,758
things that took 27 hours to run and

353
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:16,050
then you can look through the results

354
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:18,329
yourself and not annoyed ever apps yes

355
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,329
you can also give developers tools and

356
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:23,939
pay for them there's lots of free

357
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:27,269
security testing tools I'm a big fan of

358
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:29,040
giving developers tools because dev and

359
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:30,660
ops people are highly technical that's

360
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,040
why they do their jobs because they like

361
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,870
that sort of thing teach them how to

362
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,630
break surf teach them how to defend

363
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,699
things I have gotten a lot of people of

364
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,139
my time to do my job it's awesome

365
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:44,990
because like I said there's one of me

366
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:49,889
and like 4,000 of them and oh yeah and

367
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:51,600
more if you are able to rate your own

368
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,459
libraries create your own tools if you

369
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,190
have to I think the who here was at the

370
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,099
panel early

371
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:59,050
the deficit cops panel so ask though is

372
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,670
there from Netflix and they've created a

373
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,410
lot of their own tools and then open

374
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,050
search them which is ridiculously cool

375
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,459
of them and so she has lots of awesome

376
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,949
advice to give about that so if you

377
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:12,388
follow some of the Netflix stuff but yes

378
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:15,250
and the last thing is just be creative

379
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:16,810
thank you and do anything you can to

380
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,970
enable Devon ops to get their jobs done

381
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,008
more securely if you have an idea and

382
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:24,220
you think it will help ask them or try

383
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:28,019
it they will appreciate your effort next

384
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:31,480
faster feedback so this is what I call

385
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:34,360
pushing left right so I want feedback

386
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,970
right away I want to know amazing I want

387
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,279
to know immediately so this is this is

388
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,620
the thing that I show bosses and Mike

389
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,779
look how much money we'll save but will

390
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,399
also save over time will save stress

391
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,410
will save our employees from having to

392
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:50,379
do heroics like staying overnight and

393
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,550
other things like that I don't know if

394
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:53,589
these numbers are exactly correct

395
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,089
everyone that has done this study gets

396
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:58,000
lately different numbers but let's just

397
00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:00,130
say it's exponential the cost increase

398
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,610
every single phase that you find a bug

399
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:06,250
later and more painful - okay so what

400
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:09,490
does this mean for Devon ops please tell

401
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,709
us when we make a mistake please tell us

402
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:14,230
so we can fix things and we will tell

403
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:16,029
you as well and it sounds really silly

404
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,850
but it's actually really really

405
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:21,279
important to communicate I know it's the

406
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:24,819
worst right speaking to each other at

407
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:28,149
work yes I'm also a big fan of inviting

408
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:29,680
Dever ops folks on security activities

409
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:31,779
so for instance if we're gonna do

410
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,339
security exercises if there's someone

411
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:36,459
that is a security champion someone

412
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:39,009
that's interested invite them to like a

413
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:41,018
security incident simulation or exercise

414
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:44,230
or invite them to training if you can

415
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:46,660
afford it you might be impressed you may

416
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:49,120
be really really impressed okay so what

417
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,829
does this mean for security it means

418
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,930
pushing left means giving a feedback

419
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:55,149
right away getting feedback as soon as

420
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,878
we can it means putting tests in the

421
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,290
pipeline instead of having all of our

422
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:02,899
stuff out of

423
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:04,849
it means automating as much as we can so

424
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,770
sometimes the automation that you do

425
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:08,030
should be out of the pipeline so that

426
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,189
you're not wasting time like for

427
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,109
instance you could scan all the code

428
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:15,740
repositories every week for static code

429
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:17,678
or software composition analysis to make

430
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,150
sure that you know there's not any known

431
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,189
vulnerable dependencies that are really

432
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,900
scary that are being used that's the

433
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:26,390
thing you can do out of the pipeline and

434
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,580
then save a lot of time for everyone

435
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,890
right and you could run that constantly

436
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,330
you could automate it have all things go

437
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:35,090
to your email if there's something

438
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,010
disconcerting everything you can

439
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,629
automate that's the best make sure

440
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,730
there's no false positives I'm gonna say

441
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,919
that a few times because there's nothing

442
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,750
like losing trust of the entire team I

443
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,669
worked somewhere once and I found out

444
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,460
that they had an auto rule and the dev

445
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:53,210
team to send all of the reports from the

446
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,530
VA team directly to the trash yeah I'm

447
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,210
not kidding it was like their full-time

448
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,700
job to send these reports

449
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,570
Helen was reading them and then I joined

450
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:04,580
and figured that out by causing trouble

451
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,590
yes and security to every single phase

452
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,059
of the system development lifecycle even

453
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,889
if you're doing DevOps you're still

454
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:12,760
having requirements for your project a

455
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:16,900
security person should be there ok oh

456
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:19,429
yes provide feedback often and earlier

457
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,130
ok so what else does this mean for

458
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:25,070
security it means even more it means we

459
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:28,549
have to listen it sounds obvious right

460
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:30,439
but it means we have to listen I'm gonna

461
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:32,270
steal a story from my friend Travis who

462
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,400
works at Netflix he's really cool he

463
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,179
gives talks and hears talking about a

464
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,710
repo man

465
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:38,840
so they made this tool to try to

466
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,419
implement least privilege and it would

467
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,730
go and it would just take away different

468
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:45,590
privileges from different instances and

469
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:48,470
they kept breaking everything and then

470
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,030
they became quite unpopular it's not a

471
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,910
way to make friends by breaking people's

472
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,379
code or apps or bringing things down ops

473
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,330
people really don't like that so they

474
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,630
took it away right back to the drawing

475
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:02,000
board and then they made wreaths oh kid

476
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,530
and repo kid would just watch and watch

477
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,640
the instances and then it would say you

478
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,649
know what you haven't used that

479
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,900
permission in quite a while and then it

480
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,070
would remove them one by one and they

481
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,050
ended up implement

482
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,629
least privilege in this amazing way

483
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,250
where they didn't break everything and

484
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,750
people actually still like the security

485
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,130
team and still ask for their help and

486
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,910
still engaged with them and it's

487
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,500
beautiful

488
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:23,540
he's gonna tell the story better than I

489
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,790
did because you know he did it

490
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:29,720
but the point is is like is that they

491
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:33,230
listened and then adjusted and then

492
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,720
tried again don't give up so this is the

493
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:40,970
photo slide and then we're gonna talk

494
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:44,870
about negative unit tests and sorry we

495
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:46,520
have to go fast not a lot of time if you

496
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,739
work at a place where they do unit tests

497
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,690
and I hope you do you can take the

498
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,700
positive unit tests that your developers

499
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,670
make the ones that test that it does

500
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,920
what it's supposed to do

501
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:59,780
copy them and then make negative unit

502
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,300
tests and by that I mean make sure that

503
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:05,300
it fails gracefully when I inject awful

504
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:07,520
payloads this is a really great way to

505
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,100
get regressive security testing this is

506
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,080
a time intensive activity but oh my gosh

507
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,449
it's magical especially if you've had a

508
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:18,949
pen test done you take those results and

509
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:20,810
you make make unit tests out of it oh I

510
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,820
like to get all the value I can when a

511
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,710
consultant comes in I like to get as

512
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,470
much value as I can because consultants

513
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:30,170
cost a lot okay so what else does this

514
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,330
mean for security it means inviting dev

515
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,000
and ops to participate in incidents

516
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,760
threat modeling security sprints etc if

517
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,200
you can invite them invite them what

518
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,310
else does this mean for security it

519
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,620
means using tools like a wasp defect

520
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,030
dojo which takes metrics from all the

521
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,860
different security tools and then shows

522
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,990
you beautiful pictures and graphs that

523
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,090
help you see what you need to work on

524
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,470
the most right and then take that and

525
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,580
make a Lunch and Learn out of it

526
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,890
oh is everyone doing cross-site

527
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:01,240
scripting maybe we should make lunch and

528
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:06,200
learn and give education on this topic

529
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:08,460
yes and this way wait there we go

530
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,900
so this is photo slide number five

531
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,490
I really have to get moving cuz I think

532
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,190
I have five minutes left and I still

533
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:17,670
have two more slides so the third way in

534
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:19,590
DevOps is continuous learning and I

535
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:23,340
don't have a cute little ass keep rowing

536
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:25,199
for it but if we don't keep learning you

537
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,760
will get left behind who here's worked

538
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,670
with someone where they're you know

539
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,350
super senior and everything depends on

540
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,930
them and if they miss one day of work to

541
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,199
go to training everything will break

542
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,250
yeah

543
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,720
that's because you haven't been on

544
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,880
training in like ten years and you're

545
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,980
doing everything the old way that person

546
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,510
needs to go in training most if you

547
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,940
can't have someone miss one day of work

548
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,250
that person's life sucks if you want to

549
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,530
keep your employees for a long time you

550
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,300
should try not burning them out this is

551
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:54,389
my opinion as someone who has been that

552
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,190
person okay so for Devin ops this means

553
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,860
please accept security training if we

554
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,780
offer it to you you could train

555
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,639
yourselves I'm gonna share a lot of free

556
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,200
stuff joining your local OS chapter

557
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,950
attend this awesome conference again

558
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,370
next year

559
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:10,350
things like that and share information

560
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,909
when you fix a security issue with all

561
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,149
the other people on your team and even

562
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:20,160
maybe the other teams but for security

563
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:22,140
Oh give training whenever you can make

564
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,360
every single moment a teaching moment if

565
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,670
you find a problem with when security

566
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,070
team and they're always doing this other

567
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:30,510
or when dev team or ops team you

568
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,159
probably want to show all the other team

569
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,200
members too because that problems

570
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,700
probably happening there as well I have

571
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,430
learned this we often make the same

572
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,170
mistakes share information again when

573
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,570
you fix a security bug so if one team

574
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:46,500
has a problem assume the rest might have

575
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,909
it and provide metrics whenever you can

576
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,800
to help the team's know what to

577
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,210
concentrate on we can't say the sky is

578
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,970
falling I've learned that doesn't go

579
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:56,580
very well and instead we need to make

580
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,170
sure that we are emphasizing the most

581
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,620
important things and explaining clearly

582
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:03,150
why so we can help motivate them instead

583
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,469
of just scaring the bejesus out of them

584
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:11,730
yeah another thing is so if you want to

585
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:13,810
get more advanced in dev SEC ops there's

586
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,240
things like chaos engineering and

587
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,490
teaming where you introduce problems

588
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,730
into production and make sure that

589
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:24,850
everyone can react to them successfully

590
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:29,340
and gracefully don't start with this do

591
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:32,350
all the other things first also oh um

592
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,750
also I'm a huge fan of security

593
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,580
exercises so I used to work at Elections

594
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,980
Canada I'm Canadian I'm sure at some

595
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,530
point I've said aboot during this

596
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,200
presentation if you've noticed my accent

597
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,990
so I ran the security for the election

598
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,020
in 2015 where we voted in that guy with

599
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:52,120
the great hair and Elections Canada

600
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,340
before every major election six months

601
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,020
in advance they run a fake election they

602
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,939
build an office they do everything they

603
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:01,180
had people pretend to vote and they

604
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,160
invite hackers and they throw security

605
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,630
incidents and do all this stuff and then

606
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,790
they do post mortems on everything

607
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,650
improve everything and then during

608
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,159
election day we were you know not in the

609
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,230
paper

610
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,110
nothing everything was great it's so

611
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:16,150
awesome no new gray hair so invite your

612
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:18,580
developers on exercises like this if you

613
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,860
can hold them they're so worth it it is

614
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,530
our job to enable Devon ops in every

615
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,679
single possible way we can I have one

616
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:30,460
minute left so I am gonna skip this last

617
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:33,670
part and instead get right to the

618
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:36,010
culture part security needs to become a

619
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:39,040
part of and this means we need to do

620
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,660
things like celebrating wins we need to

621
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,670
work closely together we need to speak

622
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,760
to them just to be clear that's what I

623
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:47,890
mean we can't blame them we can't point

624
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,940
fingers anymore security is really good

625
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:53,500
at telling people when they've done a

626
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:55,360
bad job and as best as we can for

627
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,320
scaling create security champions

628
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,969
security champions are your best friends

629
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,629
so with that I would like to call upon

who wishes they knew enough to be able

655
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,610
