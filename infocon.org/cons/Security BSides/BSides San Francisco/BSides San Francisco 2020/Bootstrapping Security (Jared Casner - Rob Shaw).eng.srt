00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,679
I like sorry

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:35,370
help me welcome rob and Jared all right

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,120
thank you all right welcome everyone

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,320
thank you for being here with us today

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,669
real quickly before we get started how

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,469
many of you are spending six hundred

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,469
million dollars this year on security

17
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,410
lots of hands all right cool know this

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,610
talk is not for people that are spending

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,440
six hundred million dollars this year on

20
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,460
security in fact it's not for people

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,260
that are even spending six hundred

22
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,879
thousand maybe not even six thousand

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,309
dollars on security right we're talking

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,500
about day one when you get your security

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,968
program started you might not even have

26
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,260
received funding for your startup yet

27
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,570
you just want to get that security

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,490
program off the ground

29
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,339
I'm Jared kesner I run engineering at

30
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,548
c-note I'm Rob Shaw and I'm a principal

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,290
engineer c-note is an impact investing

32
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,520
platform where you can invest in women

33
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,619
and minority-owned businesses

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,298
low-income housing and community to

35
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,520
develop community development

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,950
initiatives across the u.s. we are a

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,479
FinTech we do care about security we

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,579
care about privacy we're dealing with

39
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,990
money we're dealing with a lot of PII so

40
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,199
we had to start up that security program

41
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,640
on day one even before we had funding we

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,500
had to have some way of protecting our

43
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,280
customers protecting our data and

44
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,509
protecting your money so today we're

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,549
going to talk about security tools and

46
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,130
ideas for a big impact with a small

47
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,320
budget all right we did ask that they

48
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,759
can doubt popcorn on the way in so you

49
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,020
guys could throw it at us it looks like

50
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,659
that didn't happen so that's gonna make

51
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,009
this a lot more pleasant for us so thank

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,860
you for whoever didn't pass off the

53
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:02,060
popcorn some caveats here we're gonna

54
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,320
talk about a lot of tools today that are

55
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,790
these are things that we used several

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,258
years ago when we first got started

57
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,170
that does not mean a that we are still

58
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,220
using them although in many cases we are

59
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,200
it also does not mean that they are the

60
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,370
only tools available

61
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,679
right we're going to talk just about

62
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,540
what we used and the idea is that it

63
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,980
would have worked for us really isn't

64
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,840
means of springboarding a conversation

65
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,179
so that we can get things out in the

66
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,510
open and talk about things that worked

67
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,129
and ideally can see that conversation

68
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,599
afterwards with everybody here about

69
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:31,250
things that have worked for you so we

70
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,109
can help other people as they start

71
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:38,120
their companies move forward with that

72
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:41,150
Thank You Terry so as a software startup

73
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,590
it's easy to focus solely on security

74
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,489
within the engineering part of your

75
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,730
organization

76
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:48,650
however from day one I really believe

77
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,290
that the rest of the organization should

78
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,940
also be focused on security as engineers

79
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,920
you know security happens to be a

80
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,230
byproduct of doing our work but the

81
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,420
things that we build are used by others

82
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,760
within the company and our users and

83
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,250
without the proper policies and focus on

84
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,260
security it can be hard to truly protect

85
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,829
yourself if you think back to the

86
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,420
opening keynote flea discussed that the

87
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:14,810
engineering and security can feel

88
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:18,380
outnumbered and outgunned and one thing

89
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,569
that we have done is started security

90
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,720
from day one for everybody in our

91
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:26,000
organization and when you do that on day

92
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,950
one it makes it a lot easier to have it

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,720
continually be done if you try to wait

94
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,380
till three or three or four it's gonna

95
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,150
be a bit hard so as a part of this you

96
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,100
know we have made it a priority that

97
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,560
everyone at c-note has an understanding

98
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,079
of security the areas in which their

99
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,180
jobs could be affected and added this as

100
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:46,430
additional expectations via job

101
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,410
descriptions and we don't just say it's

102
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:51,650
everyone's we don't just say it's

103
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:53,510
everyone's job it is everyone's job and

104
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,459
just a quick caveat related to their

105
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,440
role we're not gonna ask a marketer to

106
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:00,560
you know parts are gain ask query logs

107
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,930
and try to find the attacker so real

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,489
quick before we go forward we're we're

109
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,370
pretty sure we've heard this Job

110
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,319
Description idea from B sides before we

111
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,180
could not find the presentation if any

112
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,099
of you happen to have given it or no

113
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:17,298
gave it please let us know we'd love to

114
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:19,668
give the proper attribution so by

115
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,489
putting security in the job description

116
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:24,520
it really helps us scale with our

117
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,259
culture Jarrod talks our

118
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,799
you know we're talking about it from day

119
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:31,560
one right and so giving that opportunity

120
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,169
for people to understand what that means

121
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,759
it means from our side everyone from an

122
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:39,240
engineer to a customer service

123
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,979
representative to the CEO partakes

124
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,960
insecurity practicing and so some of the

125
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:45,609
things that we do we discuss training

126
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,280
which I have a pretty funny story about

127
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:50,080
later we also discuss maybe recent

128
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,659
articles that are happening in our

129
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,490
industry for example the ring security

130
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:57,340
measures and some of the articles that

131
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,569
came out about that and by doing that we

132
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,609
are educating everyone within the

133
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:02,380
company and as a byproduct we're hoping

134
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,180
not only are they understanding security

135
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,780
internally and what they can do for

136
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,729
c-note

137
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,818
but also maybe their own security at

138
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:11,500
home in thinking about privacy so I'll

139
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:13,180
make a quick assumption that most people

140
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,460
understand security from an engineering

141
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,469
and kind of QA perspective in this room

142
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,180
so I'm going to jump over that but if we

143
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:21,159
were to take a quick look at marketing

144
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,560
let's say they're out there they find a

145
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:25,509
brand new tool that they want to use and

146
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,069
it's a third-party tool they go ahead

147
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:29,289
and they hook it up to your email system

148
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:30,550
you know they put their email in it and

149
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,719
now it's able to read all of their

150
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,090
emails but it's going to make their

151
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:36,280
workflows great then they decide hey you

152
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,568
know what let's throw that on CEOs email

153
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,369
as well because that's going to really

154
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:42,849
improve their job well now you have a

155
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,680
shadow IT problem and if you add

156
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,940
security in the job description there's

157
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,779
things that you can do that make them

158
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,370
maybe not do that right away so you know

159
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:52,840
that's a marketing example but that can

160
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,210
happen in engineering as well so I don't

161
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,479
want to just pick on marketing I like to

162
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,008
peruse Reddit producthunt hacker news

163
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,270
there's a lot of great tools that I just

164
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:04,529
want to sign up for and play around with

165
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:08,139
but I need to be more careful about that

166
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:09,789
so you know we've been having a process

167
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:10,960
for those kind of things and we're going

168
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:12,550
to talk a little bit on the next slide

169
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,169
but I just want to leave you with the

170
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,449
fact that put by putting it in the job

171
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:19,750
description it ensures that every single

172
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:22,090
member of our company does their part in

173
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,949
understanding security and by that it

174
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,388
becomes the cost of doing business

175
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:28,900
everyone must hold each other

176
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:30,940
accountable and reinforce security and I

177
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,679
think one more thing we haven't had to

178
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,300
hire a full-time security professional

179
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,620
yet in our three years we've been

180
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,850
bootstrapped and we're you know Jer

181
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,560
have been running it from the

182
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,360
engineering side but by having the

183
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,830
entire company doing it it's made us

184
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,750
more protected as a whole so building on

185
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,270
job descriptions with security being a

186
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,790
core component you can expect everyone

187
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,039
to be able to discuss threats risks as a

188
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,550
company and make the right decisions

189
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,020
hopefully this is security by design

190
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,669
there are broad enough that they can be

191
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,919
used while working on new feature

192
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:06,080
development updating an existing process

193
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,120
and customer service or really any other

194
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,510
piece of work that your business faces

195
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,550
so here's what helped us from day one we

196
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:17,719
adopted a very simple one-page

197
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,910
RFC process that anybody has to fill out

198
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,520
to get something implemented and because

199
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,669
it is a one-page document we make sure

200
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,250
that everyone does that and yes it seems

201
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:30,409
a little anti agile it might seem like a

202
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,930
little bit of extra work but this small

203
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,789
extra amount of planning allows us to

204
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,850
start thinking about the solution from a

205
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:39,560
higher level within this RFC document we

206
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,630
have a section focused on risks and

207
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,700
securities that we use to define things

208
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,270
that could go wrong how we will handle

209
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,520
it

210
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,590
finding the level of acceptable risk and

211
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,000
measuring whether we did well or need to

212
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,250
rethink it the next time around

213
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,870
and once this document is built and I

214
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,880
want to preface real quick but we really

215
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,590
ask in time box it to less than two

216
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,719
hours because we really don't want a lot

217
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,880
of time we can spend on it we then share

218
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,430
that with the entire company and then

219
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,320
anybody and what some founder down to

220
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,030
customer service can read about it throw

221
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,659
in their two cents it gives us a wider

222
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,940
breadth of a potential threat now we are

223
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,710
a small team or less than 20 people so

224
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,419
you might question whether if you were

225
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,880
5,000 if you could send that document

226
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:22,219
out to everybody I would say yes because

227
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,169
at the very least you're getting people

228
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,449
outside of your you know small team or

229
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:30,049
in your area to potentially be able to

230
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:31,699
give you thoughts basically at the end

231
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,380
of the day what do I want to get from

232
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,810
that is everyone should review

233
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,338
everything if possible because you know

234
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:39,619
at a company it's important to

235
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:42,050
understand what's going on and a quick

236
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,429
anecdote that we ran into so you know

237
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,380
the marketing team decided that they

238
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:47,060
wanted to add Google tag manager and if

239
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,579
you're not too familiar with that

240
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,160
basically script injection inside of

241
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:52,349
your website

242
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,449
and so after that process was for that

243
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,040
RFC was posted Jared and I kind of went

244
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:57,329
back and you know showed the trade offs

245
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,920
and we ended up going a different

246
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:03,479
direction and you know one last thing

247
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,339
opening up this process not only has

248
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,920
been great for security but it's also

249
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:10,230
been able to allow us as a distributed

250
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,290
team to have documentation and that has

251
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,180
been vital especially down the line when

252
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,009
something goes wrong or something needs

253
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,930
to be changed we can all go back and

254
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:23,850
look at how we got here so keeping up to

255
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,859
date with the best security practices is

256
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,310
challenging even for most engineering

257
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,470
teams

258
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,849
we're not Bank of America sounds like

259
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,259
nobody else in here really has six

260
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,259
hundred million dollars to spend or

261
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:36,029
twelve thousand employees so since

262
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:39,689
that's not an option here's kind of

263
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:40,949
what's worked for us what I'm going what

264
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:42,389
we have my hair up behind us on the

265
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:44,699
slide are some of the tools that we've

266
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:47,879
used that are free or have some type of

267
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:50,008
freemium option I'm sorry not freeing

268
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:53,129
them up and a paid option to be able to

269
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:55,019
access the content so pager duty it

270
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:57,180
publishes slide decks of security

271
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:58,560
training materials not just for the

272
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,959
technical side but also for the

273
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,579
functional and then in youtube you can

274
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,758
obviously get videos of past b-sides

275
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:07,290
talk Def Con talks tutorials there's a

276
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,730
lot of great content if you're looking

277
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,589
to you know make sure you're building a

278
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,110
secure server or if you want to teach

279
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:15,420
somebody about privacy and security and

280
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,060
then obviously besides of course thanks

281
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,620
for having us here and helping us keep

282
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,959
our costs low the reason we wanted to

283
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,490
give a talk is we got to where we are

284
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,069
today by some of the stuff that we've

285
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,380
learned here and with those adopted

286
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:29,729
security practices from day one we were

287
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,560
able to educate our staff during

288
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,649
onboarding but we also were able to do

289
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,268
it continually and so as I mentioned

290
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:38,370
before we recently were discussing as a

291
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,959
company the ring stuff that has been

292
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,269
recently going about and kind of

293
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,279
explaining what we do to mitigate some

294
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:46,170
of those concerns but also to help

295
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,339
educate everybody on the team about what

296
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,199
they should be thinking about when they

297
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:53,370
log in and create accounts on different

298
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:54,930
platforms outside of our own lastly I'm

299
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,600
gonna I'm going to tell a kind of

300
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:00,120
slightly embarrassing story fish me free

301
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,690
is a great tool that you can use to do

302
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,430
fishing training in your email system

303
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,260
so a couple of months in and when I

304
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,979
joined cenote I saw an email that looked

305
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,930
suspicious

306
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,820
my immediately thought I'm gonna look

307
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,040
into this and report back to Jared

308
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,990
as soon as I clicked it you can probably

309
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,510
imagine my horror when it said this has

310
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,540
been a test jared has been notified of

311
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,770
their grave misjudgment

312
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,920
you're still employed right so that is

313
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:26,540
true I'm the whale employed for now but

314
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,770
it's super embarrassing mainly because I

315
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,599
was the only person in that round to

316
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,819
have opened the email and maybe the only

317
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,850
one that's ever done that it's you know

318
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,800
so but just speak on top of fishing real

319
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,890
quick it is a great opportunity for

320
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,260
those outside of the technical realm to

321
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,689
get tested as well and Jared's pretty

322
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,100
cunning he did it around the holidays so

323
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,560
he made sure that it was something about

324
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:52,490
hey your package was shipped you know so

325
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,290
it was very kindly as well so there's

326
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,700
obviously tons of content within each of

327
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,890
the resources that we've just talked

328
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,540
about if you guys have suggestions that

329
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,580
we could add to the slide to help others

330
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,680
please pull us aside after the talk -

331
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,000
tomorrow or on Twitter we'd love to add

332
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,020
them because we really want to help

333
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,010
companies that are you know

334
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:11,630
bootstrapping their security so to this

335
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,340
point we have discussed how you and your

336
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,750
entire company can make changes to your

337
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,550
job descriptions and think through

338
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,440
attacks that it could occur and then

339
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,420
improve upon that with education about

340
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,190
security well let's discuss building a

341
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,410
little bit more of a defense-in-depth

342
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,210
security stack there are lots of free

343
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,770
tools out there and here are some of

344
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,330
them that we recommend that are free

345
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:32,000
from day one and have a freemium model

346
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,520
to help you grow so for detecting

347
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,880
vulnerabilities we use sneak we use

348
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,800
sonar cube antivirus we have clam Navy

349
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,230
for Linux we use silence on our

350
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,930
employees laptops and then for

351
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,700
development we're using a Wasa's app to

352
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,709
be able to manually test you know our

353
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,130
responses and handling them between the

354
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,390
browser we also use security tools so

355
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,400
that we're checking that everything that

356
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,470
we return is being protected from

357
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,650
clickjacking and cross-site scripting

358
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,970
and if you're a team or if you happen to

359
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,350
know JavaScript are working on

360
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,390
JavaScript I'm sure you're familiar with

361
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,310
NPM audit but if you're not in your

362
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:10,010
protecting teams that are this is a

363
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,300
great tool to be running constantly on

364
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,920
your codebase and checking your

365
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,780
dependencies to make sure anything

366
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,760
that's out of date or

367
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,740
as open vulnerabilities that have been

368
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,930
patched it'll let you know what those

369
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,310
are so one recommendation is constantly

370
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,930
be running that because once you get

371
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,060
behind especially with the way the

372
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:29,380
JavaScript ecosystem is you might have

373
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,380
to spend a lot more time to catch up

374
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,730
take over here to talk a little bit of

375
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:35,570
kind of next level of this

376
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,070
defense-in-depth

377
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,540
right logging and reporting the

378
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,830
forensics the ability to understand

379
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,870
what's going on your system as the slide

380
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,700
says it's just do it right

381
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,800
having that central logging system is

382
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,840
gonna be a critical component you know

383
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,130
it's great to have ephemeral ephemeral

384
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,050
boxes which is something that we

385
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,220
designed from day one but if you don't

386
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,660
have that centralized logging system

387
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,860
you're not gonna be able to do anything

388
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,130
with those logs as soon as that box

389
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,560
disappears right so choosing tools

390
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:02,030
whether it's log Lee or one of the other

391
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,199
ones it has a freemium model or one of

392
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,970
the more expensive ones like Splunk

393
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,740
having that centralized logging system

394
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,150
it's great we actually put some

395
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:13,340
redundancy into the system by also

396
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:15,860
logging things to cloud watch likewise

397
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,760
just having the logs there doesn't do

398
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,350
you a lot of good unless you can

399
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,370
actually report on that and understand

400
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,530
what's going on in your system right so

401
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,690
we can access effectively built a DIY

402
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:25,280
sim on top of Wagle in the early days to

403
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,890
give ourselves some additional security

404
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,430
logging and some additional reporting

405
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:34,580
tools we pipe that into slack into pater

406
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,040
duty we've also got our CSP reports

407
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,360
going into century and you know actually

408
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,709
speaking of CSP getting that content

409
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,870
security policy and on day one of your

410
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,880
organization that will save you a huge

411
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:45,350
amount of headaches later on probably

412
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,000
over the last few years I've heard many

413
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,100
talks that b-sides about from people

414
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,110
saying how difficult it is to implement

415
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,570
a content security policy after the fact

416
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,740
you started on day one much easier but

417
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,290
again unless you're reporting on that

418
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,900
through something like sentry or report

419
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,939
URI that I was on the last slide you're

420
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,350
not really doing yourself any good so

421
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,500
having that reporting feedback loop is

422
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,330
critical and that feedback loop also

423
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,950
goes into things like Demark right it's

424
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,600
again more than just the application

425
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,950
security how do you make sure that your

426
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,930
customers are protected and that they're

427
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,850
not getting spoofed emails allegedly

428
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,349
from your organization putting Demark

429
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,030
into place again on day one making sure

430
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,910
that as you add those additional

431
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,620
third-party email providers whether it's

432
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,819
Zendesk or anything like that you're

433
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,160
actually thinking about that from the

434
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,899
very

435
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,430
beginning and making sure that you've

436
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,129
got that configuration set up and then

437
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:34,138
reporting on it in addition to the

438
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:36,120
logging and reporting that we really

439
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,980
need to have some forensic tools right

440
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,379
so the first thing I did when I joined

441
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,519
c-note called a buddy of mine who one of

442
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:43,350
my fraternity brothers happens to be in

443
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,389
the cyber task force the FBI and I said

444
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,300
hey Dave how do I stop myself from

445
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:50,129
getting hacked and he laughed because as

446
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,269
we all know in cybersecurity there's the

447
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,829
adage that you've either been hacked

448
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:55,199
already or you haven't been hacked yet

449
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:57,839
right so he just kind of laughed at me

450
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,160
and I said okay so let's assume I'm

451
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,300
calling you because I had been hacked he

452
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,740
said okay great the first thing I'm

453
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,969
gonna ask you for your dns career log so

454
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,490
I immediately jump down to my box and

455
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,810
said look for idea is great logs and lo

456
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,449
and behold there were none so I wrote a

457
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,979
very simple DNS law query logger it's

458
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:12,300
just a simple wrapper around TCP dump

459
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,709
it's actually available on our github

460
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,060
page for those of you again getting

461
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:16,739
started if you're using something like

462
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,329
elastic Beanstalk it's really easy we've

463
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,540
got the eb extension so you can go ahead

464
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:24,388
and get that deep TCP dump query logger

465
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,469
in place right away it's a critical

466
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:27,839
piece of forensics that you're gonna

467
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,910
need to have but then we also needed to

468
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,300
have things like data provenance right

469
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,829
we again we're a fin tech company so

470
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,790
we've got regulatory reasons why we need

471
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:37,560
to have data provenance

472
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,660
we've got just the ability to again from

473
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,399
a forensic standpoint if we ever get act

474
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,199
or when we get hacked I should say how

475
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,850
do we know what X is what data was

476
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,040
accessed who accessed it when it was

477
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,630
access where was access from so we built

478
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,000
a full data provenance in an audit log

479
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:56,339
using tools like SNS and AWS lamda which

480
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,199
allow us to give guarantee

481
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,220
deliverability as long as you're

482
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:03,089
invoking your lambda function

483
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,850
asynchronously it also gives you a dead

484
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,900
letter Q through SQS which means not

485
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,339
only you're getting are you getting that

486
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,689
guarantee deliverability but you're also

487
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,730
getting effectively built-in error

488
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:12,929
handling because you can then in the

489
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,459
early days before you have a chance to

490
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:15,750
automate that error handling at least

491
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,919
you're getting notified and the ability

492
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,010
to go and take action on that

493
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,299
automatically it's a very simple way of

494
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,780
building out that auto logging from day

495
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:27,900
one let's talk about some other tools

496
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,940
right again if you're playing the AWS

497
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,240
ecosystem there are some excellent tools

498
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:35,309
through the AWS marketplace Trend Micro

499
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,990
deep security as a service was when we

500
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:39,000
started using very early on that gave us

501
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,330
host based IDs and IPS right from the

502
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,429
very

503
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,199
getting at a very low cost i I think

504
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:44,970
it's one cent to six cents an hour per

505
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,309
server depending on the size of the

506
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,029
server so super super low cost but even

507
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:49,590
better than that

508
00:17:48,029 --> 00:17:51,750
they provided effectively enterprise

509
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,820
level customer service on day one even

510
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,620
though we were paying one cent hour for

511
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,720
the service and I was able to have them

512
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,340
come in look at my configuration teach

513
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,039
me how to use the system make sure was

514
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,299
configured properly even more

515
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,679
importantly to show me how to test it

516
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,960
and get value out of it to make sure

517
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,950
that what was being winner was finding

518
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,210
things that we were getting alerted on

519
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,850
it properly and that we weren't getting

520
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:15,539
too many false positives also within the

521
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:17,039
AWS Marko system this the security hub

522
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:19,200
is relatively new but it's a huge

523
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,908
resource and a huge place for you to be

524
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,860
able to get additional information guard

525
00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:24,779
duty for example giving you actionable

526
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,779
information about when you're I am - I

527
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:29,490
am tokens are being used in a different

528
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:32,190
way than normal right so it has some

529
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,539
level of anomaly detection built into it

530
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,309
which is great but there are a ton of

531
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,899
tools in there if you get into Amazon

532
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:38,340
may see it can get a little bit pricey

533
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:41,939
for piping all of your logs in the cloud

534
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,350
watch like we were so we had to do some

535
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,299
additional configuration around that to

536
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:49,500
keep our costs constrained in the early

537
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:50,610
days but on the whole security hub is a

538
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,840
great place to get started that it's

539
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,870
very low cost

540
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,789
gives you a lot of value also relatively

541
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,799
new to the AWS ecosystem is Systems

542
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:00,419
Manager if you're not familiar with that

543
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,120
one of the best things about that tool

544
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,980
is you can now go completely key free

545
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,989
for your SSH access and have everything

546
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,580
be driven through I am roles and I am

547
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,710
permissions where you can actually grant

548
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,139
access to one of your developers for a

549
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,690
very limited amount of time just be able

550
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:17,820
to do one specific action on a bat on a

551
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,860
box and then more importantly revoke

552
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,139
that very quickly afterwards and every

553
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,850
piece every keystroke that they do while

554
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:24,990
they're in there is locked so you have a

555
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,199
complete audit trail of what they were

556
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:30,990
doing and then again thinking broader

557
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,450
than just engineering and QA having

558
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:36,539
tools like Google Authenticator or other

559
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,799
LastPass as a free freemium model from a

560
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,879
password management standpoint using

561
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,549
those getting two-factor authentication

562
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,139
and password management that notion

563
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:45,990
built in their culture early on is a

564
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:48,330
huge and critical component and then for

565
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,860
those of you who are starting a company

566
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,270
there's a good chance you're doing it

567
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,860
out of coffee shops and co-working

568
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,600
spaces and places that you

569
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,030
turi ously do not have great and secure

570
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,639
Wi-Fi the tools like algo VPN that have

571
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:01,260
free VPN service all you're paying for

572
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,460
is the cost of the server allows you to

573
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,299
scale that pretty significantly so now

574
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,890
we're going to talk about some cost

575
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,170
savings techniques I'm gonna give you

576
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,690
two the two ideas that are not terribly

577
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:15,270
intuitive or right so the first one is

578
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,010
go to RSA and you're probably all

579
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,410
laughing because that's a 2500 ticket

580
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,760
it's super expensive however quick

581
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,350
Google search will will help you find

582
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,059
that free expo hall pass that gets you

583
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,500
on to the expo hall floor you can often

584
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:26,610
find ones that include keynote speeches

585
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,520
so you can actually go to the keynote

586
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,870
talks as well but getting out into the

587
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,450
expo hall floor is going to give you

588
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,559
access to a huge amount of vendors now

589
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,850
you can see what the trends are and

590
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,290
security you can understand the new

591
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,540
lingo that comes out because it changes

592
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,610
from year over year but you can also get

593
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,990
to see what people are selling and then

594
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,510
you can go up and you know Rob talked

595
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,610
about silence is an anti-virus solution

596
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,230
earlier right or endpoint protection

597
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:50,459
earlier that is not a free service and

598
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,360
in fact you and talk to their

599
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,150
salespeople they'll tell you it's a

600
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,620
hundred point minimum well we were for

601
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,230
people who first got endpoint protection

602
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,820
so how do we get something like that

603
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:02,910
that gets counter intuitive point number

604
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,678
two which is find an MSSP and again we

605
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,270
think about MSSP is oftentimes is these

606
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,549
large organizations trying to take over

607
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,559
your entire security program there are a

608
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,020
lot of specialty MSS piece however that

609
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,480
focus just on reselling a single tool

610
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,309
like silence that allowed us by four

611
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,400
lights for seats and expand that over

612
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,450
time to the our user base today really

613
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,919
with the idea that we're gonna continue

614
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,720
to save money and only pay for the

615
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:26,760
services that we need and then the last

616
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,830
advice the last piece of advice here is

617
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,169
negotiate you'd be surprised at how many

618
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,210
companies will talk to you when you're

619
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:35,669
an early stage startup and say oh you're

620
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:38,340
precede your seed great we'd love to

621
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,419
have you as a customer the the automated

622
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,918
vulnerability scanning tool that we're

623
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,840
using we actually kind of have gotten

624
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,580
grandfathered into a contract with them

625
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,409
but they're giving us something like 80%

626
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,790
off of their rack rate just by having a

627
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,799
simple phone call with their sales team

628
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,120
right so you can you'd be surprised at

629
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,320
how much you can get out of negotiating

630
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,049
which is a very obvious and intuitive

631
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,570
thing but it's also surprising just how

632
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:00,150
well that can work for you

633
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:02,490
and finally the money shot right so

634
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,880
let's talk real quickly about how you

635
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:06,830
get that initial startup security so

636
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,090
Rob talked about job descriptions is

637
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,159
piece number one which helps build

638
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,870
culture that security culture in from

639
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,220
day one so culture is something that

640
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,629
happens no matter what at an

641
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,640
organization you can either be

642
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,750
intentional about that culture or you

643
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,430
can be unintentional about that culture

644
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,960
but you are going to have a culture one

645
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,120
way or the other and so by putting

646
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,590
security into the culture from day one

647
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,189
by putting that into everybody's job

648
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,870
description

649
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,580
you can go an awfully long way without

650
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,110
hiring that first security professional

651
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,189
and making sure that everybody is

652
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,449
thinking about the security of your

653
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,210
organization the spirit of your

654
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,070
customers the security of your data

655
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:40,190
everything along the way understanding

656
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:41,960
the threat modeling is all is a

657
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,790
time-based exercise in large part and

658
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,530
making that part of the your security

659
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,030
culture also and making that part of the

660
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,770
organizational culture where everybody

661
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,120
is doing threat modeling on every

662
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,129
business practice that they develop on

663
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,929
every tool that they purchase

664
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,340
understanding that threat modeling well

665
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,050
if we put security into your job

666
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,850
description and I'm not an accountant

667
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,740
here so bear with me on the math here

668
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,770
but as far as I'm concerned if it's part

669
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,700
of your job the cost is free so it's

670
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,720
gonna cost you is the time to do that

671
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,410
threat modeling and it's a critical

672
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,880
piece likewise with the free tools the

673
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:13,610
implementation caught time is the cost

674
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,600
but those free free tools will

675
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,360
eventually potentially turn into

676
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,429
freemium or paid tools then we get an

677
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,330
education hey 50 bucks each for b-sides

678
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,410
that's a great deal

679
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,970
logging reporting a call $120 a month

680
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,710
IDs and IPS again if you're using that

681
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,720
Trend Micro service through AWS

682
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,000
marketplace up to six cents an hour per

683
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,820
machine antivirus call it fifty dollars

684
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,440
a year for per employee the security hub

685
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,360
is going to be relatively low cost and

686
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,810
then the servers for things like sonar

687
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,979
cube and I'll go VPN call it 20 bucks a

688
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,470
month because you don't need beefy

689
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,820
machines for those and so really if you

690
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,380
assume less than 10 employees and less

691
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:51,409
than 10 machines that first year a

692
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,300
start-up cost is less than $5,000 for

693
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:55,700
your security program and with that I

694
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,159
think we are right on time so may or may

695
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,110
not have time for questions but this is

696
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,190
how to get a hold of us we'd be happy to

697
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,300
have a conversation with you out in the

698
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,280
hallway afterwards if you do have

699
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,840
questions or feel free to tweet at us

[Applause]
