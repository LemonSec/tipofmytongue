1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,270
please welcome Shore Joe from NCC group

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:09,090
hi guys

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,040
last session of the conference right so

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,500
I can see some people yawning so

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,430
hopefully I can retain your attention

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,170
for the next 20 odd minutes our little

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,130
context around the title East versus

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,960
West

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,549
when I say East versus West I'm

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,279
specifically referring to Wall Street

11
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,980
and Silicon Valley in fact uh the

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,619
financial services firms or FS forms in

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,219
Wall Street and the tech companies in

14
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,469
Silicon Valley

15
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,630
I know exceptions exist right I mean

16
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,149
there are banks in California there are

17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,829
tech companies in New York but for the

18
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,079
purpose of this presentation I would be

19
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,989
focusing on those industries which are

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,840
most closely identified with this team

21
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,480
with these two geographies first a bit

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,260
of introduction I don't know it would be

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,000
such a large screen but as you can see

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,739
from the picture unlike most things

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,710
security this is one place where I'm

26
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,289
okay with legacy perhaps deprecated

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,750
information because this picture is more

28
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,280
than a decade old and my wife told me

29
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,900
that you know that they will be able to

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,900
see you right so in terms in terms of my

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,020
experience I have worked in both the

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,299
coasts in banks in tech companies both

33
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,240
as an operator as in insecure teams as

34
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:27,360
well as a consultant advising such teams

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,589
so hopefully I have the experience to

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,700
talk about what I'm going to talk about

37
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:39,840
now before I move on to how information

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,479
security is different in a Wall Street

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,520
and Silicon Valley I would like to take

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,200
a few moments to explore how these two

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,030
industries are themselves different and

42
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,030
I would like to quote mr. rudyard

43
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,280
kipling here East is East and West is

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,890
West and never the twain shall meet

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:02,189
I'm sure he meant it in a different

46
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:03,719
context but it works well now first when

47
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,279
I when I'm describing the differences

48
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,079
between those between these two

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,419
industries I would like to talk about

50
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,709
what I call decision factors what drives

51
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:15,119
decision-making and the reason I

52
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,190
I say this is because information

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,150
security does not exist in isolation

54
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,240
right

55
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,870
it exists to meet the needs of the

56
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,970
business and in my experience FS and Tec

57
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,870
are quite different as regards their

58
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,840
business needs four FS forms the primary

59
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,040
business need is compliance it's not

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,130
that they are not concerned about

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,530
customer customer friendliness but

62
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,180
because of the myriad laws and

63
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,720
regulations that they need to abide by

64
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,700
our dodd-frank GLBA anti-money anti

65
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,490
money laundering and the huge fines

66
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,290
associated with non-compliance usually

67
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:56,100
compliance takes precedence over

68
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,230
customer friendliness on the other hand

69
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,989
with tech they are more concerned in

70
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,940
meeting the needs of the customer I know

71
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,850
recently there has there have been all

72
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,930
these privacy regs writer glba CCP etc

73
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:13,019
however in general the regulatory burden

74
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,730
for tech companies is less and that also

75
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,830
kind of plays into the organizational

76
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:22,380
culture with FS forms it's all about

77
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:25,890
going by the book dotting the is and

78
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,120
crossing the t's moving slow as long as

79
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,519
you are doing it right

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,920
whereas with tech firms it's all about

81
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:36,000
move fast and break things I'm sure you

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,010
recognize the motto so it's a four tech

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,540
forms mistakes are acceptable as long as

84
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,829
you're learning from them and delivering

85
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:46,590
fast now I would like to move on to what

86
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,110
I call success factors what what kind of

87
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,750
determine success and in my experience

88
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:56,310
the Golden Triangle of people process

89
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,170
and technology are responsible for the

90
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,030
success of any program implementation

91
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,820
and this includes an information

92
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,580
security program as well in my

93
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,709
experience FS and Tec differ in in their

94
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,160
maturities of people process technology

95
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:14,220
this those three pillars

96
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:18,269
so obviously green means good and I've

97
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,250
rated both FS and Tec good in the people

98
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,229
aspect and again this is not unexpected

99
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,890
right I mean Silicon Valley is the

100
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,580
center of technological innovation Wall

101
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,259
Street is the center of financial

102
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,479
center of the financial world I mean

103
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,669
London may disagree reservist its

104
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,490
ranking with New York but in general

105
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:38,438
it's not unexpected that the Centers of

106
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,389
these two industries would attract the

107
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,669
cream of the crop that's why people are

108
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,969
great in both Wall Street and Silicon

109
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:49,180
Valley call up to you guys there for

110
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:53,169
process unfortunately tech firms are not

111
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:56,530
as mature as financial services so as I

112
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:59,729
mentioned FS firms are all about doing

113
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,989
things by the book right making things

114
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,680
insuring that things happen right the

115
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,930
first time

116
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,969
even if that be slow and that's why if

117
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,400
they have very mature documented

118
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:11,979
processes formal process ownership etc

119
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,870
whereas with tech firms it has been my

120
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,300
experience that they're more concerned

121
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,639
about the results right process be

122
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,009
damned or well not damned maybe not as

123
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,800
important so they are really not good at

124
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:25,270
writing things down it's all in the head

125
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,520
of very some very intelligent people

126
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,710
however that obviously is a single point

127
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,680
of failure like this over dependence on

128
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,900
tribal knowledge on the technology

129
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,909
pillar again this is expected right I

130
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,489
mean tech firms by their definition are

131
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:41,050
better at technology than FS firms

132
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,930
obviously I will provide some

133
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:47,409
illustrative examples to kind of support

134
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:50,199
these points but that's for later now

135
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:52,930
moving on as to how information security

136
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,210
is different in Wall Street and Silicon

137
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,310
Valley now before I move on to the

138
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,440
differences themselves I would like to

139
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,460
take a moment to discuss

140
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,330
defense-in-depth also known as the

141
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:06,099
castle approach or a layered security so

142
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,008
as you can see from the example right

143
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:12,219
the castle the knight on a horse kind of

144
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:14,139
the attacker this con concept is

145
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:15,699
fundamentally very simple right the idea

146
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,940
is to have multiple layers of security

147
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,740
such that even if a threat breaches one

148
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:24,969
layer it would be blocked by another

149
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,219
right and in the modern world the C soul

150
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:29,319
is the Lord of the castle protecting

151
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:32,560
that castle the enterprise from the

152
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,300
hacker and imp and to do that the seaso

153
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,279
implements defense-in-depth through

154
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:41,659
administrative physical and technical

155
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:45,270
security now in my experience

156
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:47,250
the decision factor the decision factors

157
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,460
and the success factors that I mentioned

158
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,379
earlier they kind of drive how

159
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:54,900
defense-in-depth is implemented in FS

160
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,620
and tech and again for a mysterious

161
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,620
security

162
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,840
I have rated FS as more mature than tech

163
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,460
firms again this is not unexpected

164
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,039
because admin security has a lot of

165
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,680
alignment with the process pillar of the

166
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,409
Golden Triangle that I mentioned right

167
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,389
so FS forms are typically better at

168
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:14,969
processes documenting processes and

169
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:18,659
following them unlike tech firms for

170
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:20,699
physical security also I've rated FS

171
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:22,349
firms as better than tech as you can

172
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:25,560
imagine the yellow means cautionary the

173
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:28,259
green means good and I have a couple of

174
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,599
theories around this so even the today

175
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,539
we are all about electronic transactions

176
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:35,250
and create card swipes and all that FS

177
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,340
form specifically banks if you think

178
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,039
about it at one point of time they dealt

179
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:44,698
with something very tangible cash right

180
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,039
a physical asset and this asset faced a

181
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,870
real physical threat from physical bank

182
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,539
robbers right think about like the Wild

183
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,940
West bank robbers riding in on horses

184
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,250
Yahoo and all that right so I think that

185
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,240
kind of contributed to this ethos of

186
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,560
mature physical security at FS firms the

187
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,870
second theory is something that I'm

188
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,400
thankful to Mike Johnson C so at fastly

189
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,699
for because I was discussing this topic

190
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,919
with him and this interesting of kind of

191
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:14,099
idea came about if you think of the

192
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:16,529
banks and other FS forms on Wall Street

193
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:19,500
they're typically housed in this huge

194
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:22,289
tall buildings right with a single point

195
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,389
of entry on the first floor so unless

196
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,219
the attacker is Tom Cruise on a mission

197
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,740
impossible flying I mean dropping in

198
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:31,349
from a helicopter or something like that

199
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,979
they typically need to secure only that

200
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:37,588
single point of entry contrast that with

201
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,709
a Silicon Valley where the big players

202
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:42,599
are in large spread out campuses the

203
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:45,569
smaller players are insured working

204
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,360
spaces none of which are conducive to

205
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:50,850
physical security now moving on to

206
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,240
technical security again those this

207
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,930
relative rating is not unexpected and

208
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,520
also I will

209
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,949
right some examples around this but tech

210
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,810
films by their definition and the nature

211
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:04,620
of the work that they do are usually

212
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:08,479
better at technical security than FS

213
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,740
firms now moving on to the six samples

214
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,750
so around atmospheric security which is

215
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,670
all about rules and regulations policies

216
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,300
standards procedures security awareness

217
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:20,189
training etc what I've seen are some of

218
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,649
these examples and again the green is

219
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,800
called the yellow is cautionary so you

220
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:27,570
will see that for a top ten US bank I

221
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,609
saw like extensive policy standards

222
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,860
procedures with each process having a

223
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,040
formal owner as well as a secondary

224
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,200
owner and at a client insurance company

225
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,750
there were no local admin privileges use

226
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,510
of years where I was prohibited contrast

227
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,220
that with this quantum computing client

228
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,649
of mine and you can understand right

229
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,260
quantum computing right so the cutting

230
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:51,120
cutting edge of science so to speak but

231
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,279
they had a they had an utter lack of

232
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,190
documentation and all the critical

233
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,110
processes right IT and security

234
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,560
processes were dependent on one single

235
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,720
very intelligent individual now if that

236
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,500
individual were to get hit by a bus or

237
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:11,310
better yet win the lottery then pardon

238
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,930
my french that company's screwed also at

239
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,910
this IOT software developer on the

240
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,339
client of mine I saw that they were

241
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,290
actually advertising jobs saying that

242
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:23,190
hey come work for us you can use any

243
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:25,140
software you want so basically all users

244
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,720
had full local admin on their machines

245
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:32,160
and there was no restriction on USB

246
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:35,630
usage obviously that made data extrusion

247
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:39,900
as well as malware intrusion much easier

248
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:42,450
moving on to physical security also as I

249
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:46,529
mentioned FS forms are typically better

250
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:48,180
than tech firms so at again at a top ten

251
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:51,689
years bank I saw that they had badge

252
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,219
taxes with man-traps which were also

253
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,260
being monitored by security personnel so

254
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,529
basically three controls around that

255
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,149
same area right badge taxes man-traps

256
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:02,220
allowing only one person to enter at a

257
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:04,829
time and again a security person was

258
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,980
actually monitoring that compare that

259
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:08,849
with this client of mine or they develop

260
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,329
software for

261
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,269
rewards programs and I'm quoting the CEO

262
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:16,050
for beti right he mentioned he said

263
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:19,290
everything's in the cloud

264
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,540
I don't need physical security so this

265
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,349
guy this office right had multiple

266
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,149
points of entry

267
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,889
no CCTVs no badge entry right so I told

268
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:32,370
him okay consider this hypothetical

269
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:35,730
scenario you are locked into your AWS

270
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:38,639
admin account you step away for a cup of

271
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,610
coffee I walk in and walk away with your

272
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,980
laptop is that a concern for you he said

273
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,470
yes so as you can see even when

274
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:50,160
everything's in the cloud there is still

275
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:52,639
room for physical security again at this

276
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,110
asset management forum client of mine I

277
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,779
saw that their extensive CCTV coverage

278
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,490
where the feed was not only being

279
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,500
recorded but it was being actually

280
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,180
monitored life right it's not being

281
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,089
recorded just for review in case an

282
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,439
incident happened so that's like a kind

283
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:09,540
of detective control they're actually

284
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,110
doing it live so that becomes a

285
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,969
preventive control compare that with

286
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,680
this LMS developer client of mine and by

287
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,670
the way I have seen this at multiple

288
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:24,300
forms in the behavior so I go in to the

289
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:27,029
office location I sign in on a tablet my

290
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:30,089
host is notified and he or she comes out

291
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:32,310
and escorts mean now note that note the

292
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:34,620
gap here if you think about this I

293
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,050
triple a quarter of identification

294
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:41,130
authentication authorization and

295
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:43,258
auditing so I provided an identity but I

296
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:46,290
never authenticated it so I could have

297
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:48,000
put in any name right nobody asks for

298
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,800
proof of the tiny entity and the fix is

299
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,360
very simple right I mean ask me for my

300
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,870
driver's license but again something

301
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,740
that is often overlooked

302
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,730
moving on to technical security

303
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,259
obviously the situation reverses itself

304
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,459
at this International Bank client of

305
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:04,800
mine I saw that they were using

306
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,050
deprecated technologies right so their

307
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,870
systems weren't patched they were using

308
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:11,519
insecure encryption like TLS 1.2 which

309
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,050
has been considered insecure for quite

310
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,819
some time

311
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,790
also old browser versions leaving them

312
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:19,589
susceptible to drive-by downloads at the

313
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,360
social media company client of mine in

314
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:22,470
the Bay Area

315
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,390
make sure valid management

316
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,790
faster incident response so usually

317
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,410
technical controls are much better again

318
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,890
at this auto finance captive client of

319
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,660
mine

320
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,090
they had a vulnerability management

321
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,589
program in a sense they were doing

322
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,600
scanning right they were finding

323
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:39,120
vulnerabilities but there were so many

324
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,060
rules and layers of approval required to

325
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,990
remediate those vulnerabilities that

326
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,599
basically they're being left on patch

327
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,760
for a long time so kind of shades of

328
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,800
that particular company handling our

329
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,439
credit credit information and the rapid

330
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,719
she struts vulnerability right so

331
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,790
compare that again with this mobile app

332
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,020
developer they had this instead of this

333
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,360
multiple layers of approval

334
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,250
there was this bias for automation were

335
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,340
they were kind of reducing the need for

336
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,900
human intervention and that is good

337
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,860
because as we know humans are the

338
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:13,079
weakest link in information security

339
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:15,390
moving on why should it here why should

340
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,910
I care about all these differences and I

341
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:20,250
and I want to answer this question from

342
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:22,170
two perspectives one that I call the

343
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,940
Assessor perspective as in somebody

344
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:25,560
doing an assessment and the other the

345
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,840
operator perspective somebody actually

346
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,050
working in this companies so my

347
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,830
hypothesis is this that if you are

348
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,540
necessary

349
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:37,290
when you go on-site at any of the

350
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,120
companies in this industries you place a

351
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,640
greater focus on things that are not

352
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,980
traditionally that company's forty or in

353
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,270
this case that that industry is forty so

354
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,060
I will often read this with some

355
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:50,189
examples so if I'm doing a NIST CSF

356
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,520
cybersecurity framework assessment right

357
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,980
at a financial services firm I would put

358
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,590
a greater focus on controls that I've

359
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,060
mentioned there for example PRDS to data

360
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,890
in transit is being protected that's

361
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,619
that shell Lysias of control right and

362
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:06,660
the what you see the text in red those

363
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,580
are gaps that I found I'm not going to

364
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,250
read through all of them but you can see

365
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,710
that for financial services firms I

366
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:17,040
found several gaps around technical

367
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:18,330
controls where at sorry for a service I

368
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,730
found several gaps around technical

369
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,550
controls whereas with tech firms usually

370
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,750
the gaps are under are around

371
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:27,209
administrative security and physical

372
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,220
security controls for example I would

373
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,740
like to mention this first one pric -

374
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,600
physical access to assets is managed and

375
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,030
protected so one of the things that I

376
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,290
look at when I'm evaluating the maturity

377
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,199
of the

378
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,610
control is the presence of alarms and

379
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,889
again there's something that I've seen

380
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,980
at many barrier companies there are

381
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:47,720
alarms for forced entry but there are

382
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,670
there is no alarm for that door just

383
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:53,839
being held open so basically makes

384
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:57,019
tailgating so much easier now from the

385
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,660
operational perspective my messaging is

386
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:01,310
this that operational personnel across

387
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,589
the two domains should focus on their

388
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,560
relative weaknesses and learn from the

389
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:09,050
other strengths so let's say that I work

390
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,380
in the security for a bank I would look

391
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,790
towards my peers in the tech firms to

392
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,100
understand how they've implemented

393
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,410
technical controls so what I've done on

394
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,649
this slide is I basically consolidated

395
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,810
all the pros and cons right so for

396
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:26,149
financial services obviously as I as we

397
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:27,859
kind of covered earlier strong admin and

398
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:30,440
physical security with mature documented

399
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,329
processes however weak in technical

400
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,459
security and usually usually slower

401
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:36,469
decision-making which makes them logger

402
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:39,109
laggards in adopting new tech

403
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,480
whereas with tech firms usually stronger

404
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:44,240
technical security not so much for

405
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,100
physical and mystery security but they

406
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,440
early adopt us a new technology and

407
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,420
there is this bias for automation

408
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,120
however sometimes this excessive bias

409
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,910
for freedom and excessive bias for

410
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,920
action can lead to certain changes which

411
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:01,160
are not security validated so obviously

412
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,709
that's another con now moving on to the

413
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,658
last section of my presentation how does

414
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,369
it all come together and here I would

415
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:10,010
like to revisit that quote from mr.

416
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:12,438
Kipling earlier and interestingly those

417
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,049
two lines are followed by two more East

418
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,980
is East and West is West and never the

419
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,859
twain shall meet

420
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:22,730
till earth and sky stand presently at

421
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:25,879
God's great judgment seat in my opinion

422
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:29,470
God's great judgment seat today is our

423
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:33,080
shared connected technology ecosystem

424
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:35,000
whether whether it be FS firms or tech

425
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,129
firms they're using similar technologies

426
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,620
that kinds of leave are makes them

427
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,740
vulnerable to similar attackers right

428
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,629
and unlike those bank-robbers of old who

429
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,870
actually had to face the risk of being

430
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,790
shot the attackers today can be on the

431
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,149
other side of the globe possibly in a

432
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,450
known

433
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:56,150
extradition treaty country and they can

434
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,740
attack multiple targets at once and here

435
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,690
I would like to quote Mario Puzo in The

436
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,150
Godfather one of my favorite books and

437
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,390
he wrote a lawyer with his briefcase can

438
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,860
steal more than a hundred men with guns

439
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,710
now replace lawyer with his briefcase

440
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:13,399
with hacker with his or her laptop and

441
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:17,780
any company in any industry can be the

442
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:20,420
target so what I want to want to infer

443
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,010
kind of a really emphasize on is that

444
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:24,350
Wall Street and Silicon Valley must come

445
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:26,270
together to share write and learn from

446
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,510
each other because with all the three

447
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,670
pillars of the Golden Triangle this

448
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,040
edifice of the information security

449
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:36,950
program will crumble without all the

450
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,510
three layers of defense in depth this

451
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,880
castle of the enterprise will be

452
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,740
breached right so it's important to

453
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,800
share and learn and obviously a forum

454
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,800
such as besides is a great place to do

455
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,530
exactly that I would like to wrap up

456
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,419
with my last slide here so I love this

457
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,370
cartoon by the way right you have all

458
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,890
these controls and on the other hand you

459
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,810
have beef apologies to any Dave's out

460
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,740
here I didn't draw this curtain but I

461
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:05,480
loved it so if you recall when I was

462
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,700
discussing the Golden Triangle right

463
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,320
people process technology I mentioned

464
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,540
that both Silicon Valley and Wall Street

465
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,300
have excellent very intelligent people

466
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:16,520
true but even intelligent people can

467
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,129
fall prey to social engineering right

468
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,980
because that is predicated on exploiting

469
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:25,400
normal human behavior and that is why

470
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:28,670
for everybody across the board security

471
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,440
awareness training is key now finally I

472
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:32,840
would like to end with this whole

473
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,480
message is that with all this font of

474
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,580
knowledge all this information sharing

475
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,070
sometimes it makes sense to bring in a

476
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,960
third party to remove this confirmation

477
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,370
bias to eliminate this conflict of

478
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,830
interest right if you're doing your own

479
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:51,169
assessments and obviously to keep people

480
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:53,570
like me with a job so if in doubt bring

481
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:56,029
in an external expert to play the

482
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,820
devil's advocate thank you

483
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:03,450
you

484
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:03,450
[Applause]
