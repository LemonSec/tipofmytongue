coming for coming in and out welcome to

33
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,640
from cockroaches to marble floors my

34
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:31,660
name is Daniel Tobin and this is Paul

35
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,769
carrion you go through a quick agenda

36
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:37,150
here

37
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:40,000
intro background how did we get here

38
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:44,310
talk about our cockroaches and then what

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,310
we did to get to those marble floors

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:54,340
cool so I actually was one of Daniels

41
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,739
mentees let's call it and I'm currently

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,480
working with a company called primer I

43
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:03,010
spent a lot of time more on the dev side

44
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,988
and Gantt open here he ran the developed

45
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,310
security compliance mighty organizations

46
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:09,400
at a fin tech company that we worked at

47
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,890
together and he's with us I will now yep

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,640
just joined sorrow as security lead

49
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:17,589
focusing on data access to security so

50
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,010
these are some of the things that we

51
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,920
learned working together

52
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:26,079
Fintan company the fact is we've seen

53
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,200
all these these have been I think these

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,870
are three five years old

55
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,670
but like where are we going to get

56
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,380
enough people actually working in

57
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,320
security so like what are the different

58
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,200
options like up to three million people

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,329
there potentially projecting we'll see

60
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,399
how that actually plays out but what are

61
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:52,150
some of the the ways that we can expand

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:54,690
the security umbrella so a couple of the

63
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,709
big biggest things lately have been this

64
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,590
everyone's talking about devstack ops

65
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,420
I'm so excited

66
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,740
working with like the the DevOps teams

67
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,839
working with the engineering teams

68
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:08,660
shifting left whatever you whatever you

69
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,060
want to call it and the other thing is

70
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,980
our boot camps one of the things the

71
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,089
camps they're great you can learn

72
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:20,000
cybersecurity in 24 weeks I guess they

73
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:22,940
are self selecting and it's it's a good

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,880
start but we need to expand expand out

75
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:31,550
more so one of the things that I've been

76
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,230
focused on for my entire career is

77
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,730
something that I've been calling in

78
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:42,010
props and in fraps is taking these 3

79
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:45,890
separate silos of the structure of

80
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:48,349
engineering and IT as well so I actually

81
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,800
spoke at dirty VidCon in 2015 about this

82
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:54,320
like deaths a cops are starting to

83
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,620
become a thing then but still even in

84
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,599
the past like 5 years like we barely see

85
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,270
anything about the IT portion side if

86
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,830
anything I've seen more on the security

87
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,039
side just being like no we're just gonna

88
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:12,770
take it i we're done I just I can't deal

89
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:14,570
with it like whatever but I the way

90
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,539
we've really approached it is that like

91
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,760
for each of these areas like you have

92
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:22,039
people on the front lines that you want

93
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,469
to engage like they see what's happening

94
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,490
like they're getting the tickets in like

95
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,580
whether it's like changing your

96
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:32,000
kubernetes infrastructure or working

97
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:35,599
with some of your high high impact

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,340
employees like I need how like logging

99
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,740
in so like my Windows machine and I

100
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,109
downloaded this thing because there's

101
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,430
too many like security like guard rails

102
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,620
in place that I can't like do my job so

103
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,289
what we focus on what I've been focusing

104
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,960
on for my entire career is like let's

105
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:57,260
expand security out well like we can't

106
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,840
just sit like here and just tell

107
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,760
everyone no like we we need to like work

108
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,609
with the like on the front lines that

109
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,740
are working with like working with the

110
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,260
code directly working with like your

111
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,590
endpoints they know your endpoints

112
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,750
they can tell you like if you talk to

113
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,000
them about ransomware like they're like

114
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,520
yeah it's a good possibility that we

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,670
might be like these are the five people

116
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,990
that are most likely to actually get

117
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:28,880
ransomware because person a hasn't

118
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,760
restarted their computer in like seven

119
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,159
months person B barely uses their

120
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,830
computer etc etc but the people on the

121
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,130
front lines they actually know what's

122
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:45,020
happening so why like let's go out and

123
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:46,909
talk to those people so thinking about

124
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:52,159
this like this this worked really well

125
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,540
for for for us together so if we're just

126
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,530
talking about like different operations

127
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:00,530
like the other team that we worked with

128
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:03,710
and we really started engaged more with

129
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,119
the QA side like they're on the front

130
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,030
lines of like the obligation like

131
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,570
they're depending on your company like

132
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:14,539
their entire like day-to-day is like I

133
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:19,550
have code I need to check the code does

134
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:22,820
it have bugs well why can't we just talk

135
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,800
about all the bugs like can we just talk

136
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,140
about like security bugs like

137
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,600
authentication logs up authorization

138
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,000
bugs like they're already looking for

139
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,740
bugs you have people that are that's

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,690
their entire job is to find bugs like so

141
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:42,380
we started to engage like the the QA

142
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:47,060
team to take a more holistic approach to

143
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:49,040
this so some of the the things that

144
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,470
started to transfer like from from

145
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,230
security like bringing in security we

146
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:57,620
already had a pull request process we

147
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:59,120
would flag certain things for the

148
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,310
security team to review they can't

149
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,110
review everything but if they we've like

150
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,090
something oh we're changing like a 10

151
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,770
occation here let's make sure that we

152
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,570
actually get like the security team to

153
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,120
double-check that so we implemented

154
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:14,060
going from LD TM looks good to me for

155
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,240
engineering pull request to L GTS for

156
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,550
for security pull request all the way

157
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,540
into like LG tqi like let's make sure

158
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,660
that there

159
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,870
github working with the rest of the the

160
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,000
tools that the rest of our teams are are

161
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,380
working on for years we've been saying

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,010
in security oh we need security

163
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:36,080
advocates well what about just quality

164
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,909
advocates like we're all trying to find

165
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,370
bugs together like making sure that you

166
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,228
find people on your engineering teams

167
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,900
that are excited about tests that are

168
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:48,500
excited about the process of like

169
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,970
running through like CI CD and then

170
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,920
bringing that back into like the

171
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,510
automation pipeline itself making sure

172
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,380
that's like the infrastructure is code

173
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:59,660
so what we've seen like really the devil

174
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,820
soccer ops movement and overall like the

175
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,339
big gains that we've seen have been like

176
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,800
infrastructure as code or being able to

177
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,630
have like this openness being at having

178
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,829
everyone be able to contribute be able

179
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:15,710
to see was it FLE he said sunlight is

180
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,470
the best disinfectant making sure that

181
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:22,060
we have this infrastructure security

182
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:25,940
already operates as consultants there's

183
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:29,569
the most people security I've like ever

184
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:32,990
seen and I think they said about 2,000

185
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,000
people here is that like what 1,800

186
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,640
different companies you are already

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,460
working like across teams so working

188
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:44,569
with hourly QA teams to like have that

189
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:47,510
idea of a consultant the fact is like

190
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,460
again there's not enough of us as is we

191
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,740
can't do everything we need to leverage

192
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,020
tools to like to scale yourself where or

193
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,170
possible what are your engineering teams

194
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,750
do doing to to scale scale themselves

195
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,240
are they using like Jenkins to be like a

196
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,880
cron job that runs everything like what

197
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,040
are the ways that we can to work with

198
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,160
those same tools so that we're all

199
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,240
working on the same problems from from

200
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,620
the from the base level and then again

201
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,140
diversity really is the key to winning

202
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,870
one of the things that we we've really

203
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,939
found is just like finding the goats in

204
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,600
the organization Paul loves talking

205
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,690
about

206
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:31,820
but without goats we're both on hashtag

207
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:33,110
Rico 2020 at this point like who are the

208
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,090
people that you can go and talk to that

209
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,970
are excited about all sorts of different

210
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:40,670
things like if you can talk to them in a

211
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,310
way that makes sense on like what

212
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:47,540
they're trying to do like they mentioned

213
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:49,339
earlier today being able to like have

214
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,380
the same language being able to like

215
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,870
people do want to do the right thing

216
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,150
they don't necessarily know what the

217
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,610
right thing is so being able to like go

218
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:01,840
and talk to them and being like this is

219
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:04,880
how I see it from the security side but

220
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,480
this is how it actually relates to your

221
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,480
day to day job

222
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:15,860
fact is we're all hunting bugs like they

223
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,360
are security bugs I think we mostly talk

224
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,360
about that just so that people actually

225
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,760
listen to us but at the end of the day

226
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,420
we're all we're all hunting bugs like QA

227
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,550
is focused on like 9 classes of bugs and

228
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,530
we've taken one class of bugs and like

229
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,870
expanded that so that people like

230
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:35,209
actually try to listen to us but trying

231
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,800
to go back out and being like we're all

232
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,060
hunting bugs like that's what we're

233
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,650
actually trying to do we're trying to

234
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,199
prevent bugs we're trying to put out

235
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:46,430
quality software for a great like end

236
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,770
user experience the fact is the end user

237
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:52,430
doesn't care if it's a security bug like

238
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:54,319
a feature bug a lucky UX bug like

239
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,439
they're trying to do something trying to

240
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:06,110
make your software work like they just

241
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:08,690
want it to work the thing that the

242
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,790
really that we really thought about

243
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:14,030
though is like let's take a holistic

244
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,670
look like I am certain that for a lot of

245
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:22,790
these companies that have had major bugs

246
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:25,010
found a large financial company had

247
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,939
struts out there I very much doubt if

248
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:31,250
you looked at the entire like bug system

249
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,650
for that that was the only button like

250
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,990
if you really focus on this as like

251
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,520
something this is a quality problem that

252
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,290
we need to

253
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,810
Sall it's not a security problem we need

254
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,599
to solve we need to focus on the quality

255
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:48,189
from from the base level like look

256
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,260
across your your your JIRA your your bug

257
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,360
tracking system like if you look across

258
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,480
like all the bugs like where where are

259
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,000
the bugs are they do you see them like

260
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,310
across the across the spectrum is one

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,900
team dealing doing better if you focus

262
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,089
just then on the security bug like

263
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,819
building those those charts those

264
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,850
reports can you find the trends well I

265
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,980
go through do some like basic reporting

266
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:15,460
figure out the metrics like where are we

267
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:18,100
as a company in quality like overall

268
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,320
like is it just a security problem or do

269
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:25,660
we actually have to focus on the entire

270
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:30,700
company on more on like security or bugs

271
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:32,920
as a baseline again we need to remove

272
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,520
the gates it's it's not working it

273
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,050
hasn't worked like we need to stop being

274
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,020
just sitting there and like saying no

275
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,449
like it hasn't hasn't worked one of the

276
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,910
things that I see especially now of like

277
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:48,130
what I'm worried about like in in

278
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,709
security going forward is what we've

279
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,740
seen with like the DevOps movement what

280
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,600
you saw with the DevOps movement is that

281
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,780
what happened was that you had sysaid

282
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,610
mins that put up a ton of gates you

283
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:04,510
don't have sentence in many companies

284
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:06,820
anymore they are gone they're like you

285
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,130
can't necessarily give a new job at like

286
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,080
most of your your startups like here

287
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,180
like in the valley no one's trying to

288
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:18,370
say that you should be assist admin and

289
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:20,500
read from the voh manual to like tell

290
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,300
your users like they're they're stupid

291
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,490
like we need to like remove the gates

292
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:27,069
being able to like work across the aisle

293
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:36,550
working across like the entire entire

294
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:38,650
company I really think that if we if all

295
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,189
we do is talk about security bugs like

296
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:44,980
where we're creating a false dichotomy

297
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:49,570
where we're saying this this is my area

298
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:50,160
and if that's what you want it to be it

299
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,960
is

300
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,770
area and I hope you have enough people

301
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:58,410
and process in place that you feel not

302
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,870
overrun from now being that just your

303
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:03,060
area okay the rest of the company is now

304
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:06,260
running away and like doing their own

305
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:09,630
thing and you're left in your own area

306
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,670
again the the real thing that we've seen

307
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:14,250
from like DevOps from devstack Ops is

308
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:17,699
infrastructure as code having this out

309
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:20,760
there as as openness encouraging other

310
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,490
people to contribute back it's not just

311
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,680
a sysadmin like and like engineers

312
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,690
throwing that stuff like back and forth

313
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,920
it's everyone actually working together

314
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:33,570
and encouraging people to actually

315
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,270
contribute back like you now have a

316
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:44,160
sense of ownership across like these

317
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:46,949
these aisles so I'll let Paul talk about

318
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,370
some of the things that we actually did

319
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,930
yeah so we got some coverage of some of

320
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,570
the philosophy that I think that we came

321
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,099
to and working together wonder shift

322
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,810
gears here and talk a little bit more

323
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,610
about how we actually put this into

324
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,770
practice and then some of the best

325
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,590
practices that we would recommend you

326
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:07,590
investigating yourselves so I'm a really

327
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:09,870
big fan of alignment with a set of goals

328
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:13,980
or metrics when you're working with your

329
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:16,680
people or with your colleagues and I

330
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,650
think that the you tell people to work

331
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,660
on or tell them that are important you

332
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,699
know humans are gamers we will game

333
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,319
those metrics we're gonna go after those

334
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,800
sorts of things and they they can say a

335
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,800
lot so this is an example of the three

336
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,510
teams or three of the teams when Dan and

337
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,140
I kind of got into this and I was

338
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:39,620
running on the QA side you can see at a

339
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:42,660
high level there is a real emphasis on

340
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,270
agile type metrics which are based

341
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:48,449
around having let's say units of work

342
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,970
that you can consistently produce it is

343
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:54,510
interesting to reflect on this excuse me

344
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,700
and and also some qualification or

345
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,890
quantification rather of like the amount

346
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,410
of exposure that you have to badness

347
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:03,000
right so if you're an InfoSec it would

348
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,709
be a weighted score of

349
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,750
severity times a number of bugs so how

350
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:08,910
much exposure to badness weighted by how

351
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:12,569
bad that thing was right I think these

352
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,670
are easier metrics to measure but they

353
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:17,099
also aren't in your control I think that

354
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,209
that's a really critical problem so when

355
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,790
we thought about how we were going to

356
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:23,880
set up new goals we thought a lot about

357
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:26,520
trying to align everyone together around

358
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,510
a very similar set of goals and trying

359
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,090
to to build highly leverageable tooling

360
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,890
so everyone really felt across those

361
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,100
teams like they were charging towards

362
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,870
the same thing and obviously we find the

363
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,699
people that are excited about InfoSec

364
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,620
are still going to gravitate towards and

365
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,510
do things like code review from the

366
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,090
perspective of making sure that security

367
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,410
bugs don't get out there right people

368
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,360
that are on the DevOps side are gonna

369
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,460
gravitate towards deployment problems

370
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,659
but when you start to tell people hey we

371
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,280
can work together and we're gonna be

372
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,370
able to move so much faster and get out

373
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,870
behind the eight-ball it really frees up

374
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,510
people's time to be able to do the

375
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,520
things that they love to do and in sort

376
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,200
of the the the dev sock ops world

377
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,700
they're talking about education you

378
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,610
can't educate people unless you're out

379
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,710
there and doing it so this is somewhat

380
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,810
controversial I think but we focused

381
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,360
everyone around the build pipeline

382
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:20,300
health and so looking at mean time to

383
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,189
resolution and mean time to failure

384
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,409
really downplaying that number of bugs

385
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,910
and bug severity we were still tracking

386
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,470
that internally because ultimately

387
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,810
that's what we want to pull back down

388
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:31,860
but in kind of a stoic sense we wanted

389
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,840
to control the things that we can

390
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,399
control right we were making investments

391
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,860
we wanted to make an investment that led

392
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,410
us when we for example discovered a new

393
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,360
problem so a new software defect of any

394
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,740
kind or we decided we had a new idea

395
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,600
that we wanted to race out to win a

396
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,400
customer we wanted to make sure that we

397
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,419
could go from ideation to production as

398
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,520
quickly as possible

399
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,310
and we found that that gave us true

400
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,470
agility right it led us it let our

401
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,149
people go out and ourselves to go out

402
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,920
and really engage with people about what

403
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,230
was important and move quickly in that

404
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,750
regard and we found that we spent a lot

405
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,190
less time doing menial stuff that we

406
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,590
didn't need to be doing ditto with the

407
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,950
mean time to failure when you have

408
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,840
frequent incidents outages whatever else

409
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,220
frequent fire drills you're not spending

410
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,300
time on the stuff that you want to spend

411
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,290
time on people get burned out but all

412
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,020
you're not spending time on making

413
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,460
things better the the second goal is

414
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,080
codification and I think this is a

415
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,020
really interesting one

416
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,689
we made a goal to try to produce more of

417
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,970
the tacit rules that we had about how

418
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:33,160
our systems work when we were off in our

419
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,260
ivory tower saying no you don't get to

420
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,760
have that machine no that doesn't get to

421
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,010
go out because of violates compliance

422
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,930
rules hey write those down and I can

423
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,370
tell you it was scary as to be able

424
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,250
to put some of these rules out there and

425
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,239
have people come fight you over it but

426
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,710
they didn't they wanted to have a

427
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,390
dialogue with us they wanted to tell us

428
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,800
this isn't good because of the following

429
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,750
reasons people were incredibly

430
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,730
reasonable I think the bulk of people

431
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,190
like Larkin said want to do the right

432
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,110
thing and we found that really was able

433
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,870
to create a dialogue with other people

434
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,490
that was incredibly useful and

435
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,260
profitable so we started we started

436
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,970
quantifying the number of rules that we

437
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:10,629
were putting into code I'm that really

438
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,040
useful sure this is kind of the classic

439
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,630
us everything we saw that we were

440
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,920
getting the sort of things you see in

441
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,410
the Google essary book where you have a

442
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,020
sub linear growth of your operational

443
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,670
teams relative to the output or size of

444
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,980
your engineering organization and I

445
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:27,160
thought that to me signified that what

446
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,480
we were doing was actually producing

447
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,380
something that was higher leverage and I

448
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,910
was really really happy with that

449
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,940
obviously this isn't a real number but

450
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,740
you know we can talk about specifics if

451
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,350
you want later let's get this one real

452
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,990
quick let's talk about the sort of best

453
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,399
practices that we got into because I

454
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,560
will tell you this was a pretty

455
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,730
successful endeavor on our part

456
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,500
what sort of things can you think about

457
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:49,720
doing where you're able to get these

458
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,610
pretty large gains everyone across these

459
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,760
kind of operational organizations the IT

460
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,740
the DevOps the info set QA can do

461
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,750
together one really big one was

462
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,280
end-to-end tests I'm a huge fan of the

463
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,950
kind of behavioral ask stuff

464
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,510
particularly Cypress and some of the

465
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,130
some of the the assertion libraries and

466
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,810
luck that they use that gives you a

467
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,310
really good way of describing this is

468
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,350
what my application is supposed to be

469
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,060
doing it's amazing when I go to

470
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,280
consulting clients how few of them are

471
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,480
able to tell you in any level of detail

472
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,220
what their applications supposed to be

473
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,800
doing or you can ask a random Deb hey

474
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,060
what is this page for no it also

475
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,129
provides a really great jumping-off

476
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,960
points for doing additional things for

477
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,940
example I've seen people hook up fuzz

478
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,130
testing to endpoints that you hit during

479
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,020
the point of say a

480
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,370
customer into n test and when there's a

481
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,810
failure it's much easier to communicate

482
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,580
to the rest of the organization that hey

483
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,520
this thing is broken and by the way it

484
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,590
affects the login page well that gives

485
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,540
it that gives it a little bit of umph we

486
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:46,389
found also the environment provisioning

487
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:48,070
and setup was a great way to do

488
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,390
something high leverage the faster

489
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,040
people could spin up an environment to

490
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,780
test something in the low lower friction

491
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,370
that was the more likely it was someone

492
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,899
was going to do that she the investment

493
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:58,540
that we put in across the board there

494
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,310
we've got really amazing returns there

495
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:04,510
are some other places load testing tools

496
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:07,389
where we're big ones data data access

497
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,160
controls you know so Cyril where Dan

498
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,290
just started working that's an example

499
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,890
of something not only from a security

500
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,260
perspective

501
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,120
have I been exploring that for looking

502
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,220
at trying to produce things like data

503
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,209
exfiltration risk but also being able to

504
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,790
look at the performance of different

505
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,470
parts of my application and you know

506
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:27,909
which functions are touching which parts

507
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:30,580
of my data stores we also obviously

508
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,050
logging monitoring pager duty those

509
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,800
sorts of things have really high rates

510
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,899
of return we we also found that

511
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,030
utilizing things like burp suite QA

512
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,970
people do a lot of the stuff that you do

513
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:45,160
in burp suite as a pen tester they do it

514
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:48,670
using really really crappy terrible

515
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,900
tools and people's eyes burst wide open

516
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,460
particularly if they're excited about

517
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,930
this stuff when they're suddenly given a

518
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,180
way to do their job so much better and

519
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:58,270
that that was a really great thing

520
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,800
I think another another arena that we

521
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,210
spent some time looking at is sort of

522
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,590
code based meta analysis there's a

523
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,940
wonderful book called your code is a

524
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,260
crime scene

525
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,330
and one of the big things that I learned

526
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,980
there is that areas where you see there

527
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,629
there's sort of a by modality right

528
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,610
there areas of your code that never

529
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:14,950
change those are areas that oftentimes

530
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,719
when they're breakages are horrible

531
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,220
because no one's kind of kept up with

532
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,550
the joneses there there are other

533
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,980
there's another modality where you see

534
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,750
lots and lots of frequent change and

535
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,310
that tends to be an area where you're

536
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,380
going to have a lot more churn and that

537
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,899
churn again like with the the process

538
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,910
comment that Dan was making when there's

539
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,710
churn you're gonna have deployment

540
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,090
problems you're going to have logic

541
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,100
problems you're going to have security

542
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:41,439
bugs dependency problems whatever else

543
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,428
it's gonna be there so those are good

544
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,330
places to kind of start to

545
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:50,360
we mentioned the code review process oh

546
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,499
oh I got my burp right there oops let me

547
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,029
highlight one more thing because we're

548
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:55,100
running out of time here but that's the

549
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:57,080
reduction of attack and failure surfaces

550
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,178
I think that's a really big thing that I

551
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,039
think is InfoSec practitioners we think

552
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:02,600
a lot about how do you reduce the number

553
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,190
of dependencies how do you minimize the

554
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,330
amount of code doing different sorts of

555
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,980
things people in QA love you when they

556
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,470
come to you and say hey guess what you

557
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,539
have to test a whole bunch less stuff or

558
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,860
there's a whole bunch less things that

559
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:18,350
are going to go wrong with your code

560
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,418
that's awesome when you're able to

561
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,619
consolidate things down into best

562
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,990
practices where you really have a

563
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:26,330
freeway or a paved road like netflix

564
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,919
calls it maybe there's a little bit of

565
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,178
churn to begin with but you've really

566
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,159
reduced the amount of stuff that people

567
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:33,440
have to worry about similarly with using

568
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:36,320
open source tools right if you use open

569
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,179
source oftentimes people are maintaining

570
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,700
something and you don't have to put your

571
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:43,340
eyes on it as much we heard we heard a

572
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,929
great talk yesterday about auditing open

573
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,059
source dependencies

574
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:48,289
I still think open sources is in Adana

575
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:50,960
you know I think I think open source is

576
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:53,269
a fantastic way to go because often

577
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,249
times you're talking about no visibility

578
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:57,679
into code that your teams are writing

579
00:24:55,249 --> 00:24:58,940
internally versus some visibility and

580
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,230
some auditing of things that are

581
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,259
external that you can at least

582
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,580
compartmentalize so I found that to be a

583
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:08,269
really powerful thing to try to wrap my

584
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:10,309
head around let's see and I guess as a

585
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:12,289
final piece of homework I always like

586
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:14,418
talks the best what they say like go out

587
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:16,610
and do something good tomorrow with your

588
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:19,940
team and so that's that's what I'm going

589
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:21,350
to attempt to do here so if you're

590
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,759
thinking about getting started in

591
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,740
something like this if some of the other

592
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:26,509
dev SEC Ops talks that have been here

593
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,309
they've been universally wonderful I

594
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:30,649
think they're a great concept if they've

595
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:34,100
kind of inspired you the thing that I

596
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:35,840
think with with us and then with with

597
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,600
consulting clients I've experienced is

598
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,399
that instrumenting for a more data

599
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,498
different approach for managing an info

600
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:44,330
SEC Pro program or for managing

601
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,999
operational engineering programs in

602
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:49,340
general that's really giving you a good

603
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:52,279
place to start it also is a great way to

604
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,529
communicate to management as to why

605
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,100
something is important so one one great

606
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:58,230
thing for example with focusing on

607
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,939
they build pipeline health as we were

608
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,710
able to take improvements that we're

609
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,510
making for example as an InfoSec team

610
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,240
and say hey we're actually shipping

611
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:09,299
product faster people loved us for that

612
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,100
right I think there's also something to

613
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:13,470
be said for looking at the dev psych ops

614
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,600
movement the visibility that's there

615
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,880
whether you like everything that's being

616
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,740
said there or not they have some very

617
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,539
nice branding and some nice ideas that

618
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,010
are battle tested and will resonate with

619
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,799
people so I definitely would suggest

620
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,860
that you go look at that and use that

621
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:30,389
internally if you're trying to sell it

622
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,709
obviously talking to QA is huge I

623
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,470
wouldn't be here if this guy hasn't

624
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:37,350
talked to QA right that a lot of people

625
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,370
that are in QA see it as a means to get

626
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,809
into something else that's more

627
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:42,059
interesting I think that's really sad

628
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:44,070
but that's the reality of our business

629
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,750
most of the good QA people I know are

630
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,789
trying to become devs or security

631
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,960
analysts they love it when someone from

632
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:51,030
Memphis that comes and talks to them

633
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,500
because it's an opportunity for them to

634
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,639
grow and to show what they know and for

635
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,270
people that give a about what they

636
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,570
care about

637
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,590
so absolutely go talk to folks I

638
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,908
guarantee that you'll find a diamond in

639
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,649
the rough

640
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:05,520
for sure and it may not even be all that

641
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:10,020
rough and finally it's really easy to do

642
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,668
a quick audit for existing tools that

643
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,260
you can leverage externally I mentioned

644
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:15,630
end-to-end tests but there are other

645
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,740
things like for example burp suite or

646
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:22,890
Cypress tests or you know even even just

647
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:24,690
reutilizing the CI CD to run things

648
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,460
effectively on a cron that can be

649
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,530
incredibly powerful and getting to push

650
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,929
this stuff over the line and seeing an

651
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:34,168
impact when you're using internal

652
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:35,610
knowledge and you're not only are you

653
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:38,490
creating those sorts of relationships

654
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:41,610
where you can leverage your way up but

655
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:44,070
you're also getting a lot for free with

656
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,600
a very very low amount of risk so I

657
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,720
