00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,819
thanks to everyone for attending this

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:13,379
session and please welcome Christopher

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:14,730
and Abby thanks thanks everyone thanks

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,220
for coming to our talk today ever talk

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,020
about Chrome extension risks and you my

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,359
name is Chris Barcelos I work on the

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,960
lift red team and I break into systems

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,060
and help teams fix issues hello everyone

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,519
my name is Abby I work in the product

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,080
security team at lift and I was actually

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,269
more of a red teamer because these

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,620
social engineered a red teamer into

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,600
doing an on red team project so today

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,449
we're gonna cover so the background of

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,410
how we came upon this project I'm gonna

16
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:50,940
go through a few of the risks that

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:58,519
Chrome extensions can can you hear me

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:01:00,239
now sure alright it's alright ok thanks

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,070
alright so we're talking about the

20
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,750
background of how we got here we'll

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,400
cover some of the risks of Chrome

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,020
extensions and we're also gonna cover

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,030
sort of our plan and approach that we

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,619
took to mitigate these problems so Wow

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,780
originally there was some red team work

26
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,369
done at lyft and we noticed Chrome

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,220
extensions installed on different users

28
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,560
machines that we weren't quite too fond

29
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,590
of and that sort of morphed into how do

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,600
we fix this at scale so this is a

31
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,040
challenge for most companies you know

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,658
you have a lot of users used to doing

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,829
things a certain way that you're gonna

34
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,750
change it you're gonna take away their

35
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,119
ability to install things that can cause

36
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,950
some sort of friction so you want to

37
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,570
sort of get long-term support from

38
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,130
leadership and sort of have a good

39
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,669
system for maintainability and you know

40
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,270
easy easy

41
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,070
ease of use so some of the popular risky

42
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,130
extensions that we ran across looking

43
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,898
through our user base was these three

44
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,149
sort of areas I sort of we called out

45
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,850
directly as a bunch more that are out

46
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,479
there but in these cases the first one

47
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,640
is tools that do sort of productivity

48
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,320
help and they they'll ask access to they

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,479
will ask for access to the users

50
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,510
calendar and extensions sorry the

51
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,770
calendar and email and also sharing this

52
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,959
data with third power

53
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,240
another one is going to be grammar and

54
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,130
spell check tools these things will need

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,740
to have access to all pages to read and

56
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,950
change the page and also in a few cases

57
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,600
they actually say what the users are

58
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,579
editing or asking for help on to their

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,070
third-party servers which is a risk

60
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,160
because it could be saving things like

61
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,230
you know secure documents that you don't

62
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,660
want outside of the company with these

63
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,579
free tools that are basically ID moat

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,220
potentially selling the data for

65
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,080
for-profit another area is promo

66
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,940
extensions these are sometimes installed

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,490
maliciously and sometimes by the users

68
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,700
these can be used for things like

69
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,800
getting coupons or promos on different

70
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,799
different web sites but sometimes these

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,500
tools can do things like add tracking

72
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,570
palletizing phishing malware and and

73
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,310
things like that and these are very very

74
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,780
common there's millions of installs on

75
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,940
these this is an article that came out

76
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,610
last year and it covered a group of

77
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,140
extensions that were found to be

78
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,600
exfiltrating user history and then

79
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,029
selling them the actual research was

80
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,970
called beta Spy and I'm sorry called ov

81
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,910
into what the the tool did and sort of

82
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,650
how it was malicious when the tool first

83
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,630
installed it and do anything it took

84
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,880
about three weeks and then it was sort

85
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:36,480
of download a secondary payload where it

86
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,640
would then base64 encrypt your history

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,160
and then ship it off to a third party

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,799
site and then it would be set up on a

89
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,170
number site where it was sold to people

90
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,820
who wanted to sort of you know find out

91
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:52,350
what users were browsing to this is a

92
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,359
list of extensions that was brought up

93
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,640
in this research but the one that would

94
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,910
call out here is hover zoom this is a

95
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,619
tool that was used for basically you put

96
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,109
your mouse over an image zooms it out to

97
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,850
a larger size and even though that was a

98
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,739
small amount of work that it needed to

99
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,519
do it asked for a bunch of permissions

100
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:15,090
to do the malicious actions at a set out

101
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,769
for on this one here this came out so we

102
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,899
can have to go it's very recent

103
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,450
there was a researcher who worked with

104
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,250
duo through the CR excavator system

105
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,919
found a number of extensions that were

106
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,240
bad they found out eventually that this

107
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,270
was affecting

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,539
millions of users and Google eventually

109
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:36,419
found those 500 in total extensions that

110
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:38,280
were doing this malicious work these

111
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:41,060
extensions were doing things like

112
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,789
redirecting to malware sites phishing

113
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,500
stealing histories again and once this

114
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:48,389
was found and brought out and released

115
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,490
they had removed all of these malicious

116
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:53,759
--tx extensions from the Chrome Web

117
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,229
Store this isn't you might be aware of

118
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,419
when you install an extension it shows

119
00:04:55,229 --> 00:05:01,560
you which permissions it needs in this

120
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:03,659
one the extension is a new tab picture

121
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,659
but it asks for access to different

122
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:07,949
sites including the Google domain and

123
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:12,240
also the ability to read your history

124
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:14,370
and manage your apps and extensions this

125
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,139
is an example of what a manifest JSON

126
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,039
looks like this is a file it's within it

127
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,199
within an extension these these are all

128
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:26,219
of the requests it has for the chrome

129
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:28,310
API tabs is for from a security point of

130
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,169
view it's one of the things it can do is

131
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,630
pulled out the sites that each tab is on

132
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:36,299
so if you basically get your history web

133
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,430
request is an API that can be used to

134
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,440
sort of capture requests as of leaving

135
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,060
the browser manipulate them change them

136
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,150
that could be redirecting users to

137
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,630
malicious sites blocking is mostly

138
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:50,969
probably used for on for ad blocking

139
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:54,690
this URL here is for the pattern for all

140
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:58,469
sites and all URLs cookies that's gonna

141
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:00,360
be all of your users sessions the

142
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:05,520
history is just calling out directly the

143
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,349
history that the extension needs well

144
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,719
one more thing about history this can be

145
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:12,900
a pretty big concern for most companies

146
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:14,699
because the parameters in I could get

147
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,929
requests for example it might have PII

148
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,960
within them

149
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,060
it could be pulling out password reset

150
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,280
links and then data being sold off to

151
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,840
third parties there's been cases where

152
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,330
these things have been indexed in Google

153
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,888
and have had problems but in here it's

154
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:32,550
the browser pulling it out and then

155
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:34,889
reselling it we did a very unscientific

156
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,990
sample study of the Chrome Web Store we

157
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,159
could have written a scraper but we

158
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,479
thought we might hit some write limits

159
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,558
so instead we just went to the Chrome

160
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,119
Web Store page

161
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:44,369
scroll down for about two minutes and

162
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:47,189
then pars the page for extension IDs

163
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:49,409
we've got about 8,000 IDs and then we

164
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:50,999
ran those against the seer excavator

165
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,709
report tool which we'll talk about in a

166
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:55,909
second and this is sort of a breakdown

167
00:06:52,709 --> 00:07:00,089
of what those 8,000 extensions requested

168
00:06:55,909 --> 00:07:02,149
so some concerning things they so this

169
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:05,219
is the tool that we used do OC excavator

170
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:07,379
it's very useful for getting idea of

171
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:09,989
what your extensions are doing and also

172
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,669
what the users have installed it has

173
00:07:09,989 --> 00:07:13,498
three parts there's a CI excavator

174
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,599
gatherer this is a tool that's that

175
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:17,489
extension you force install or a push

176
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,039
install it into your users browsers and

177
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:21,748
then it reports back to the site and it

178
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,669
gives you the ability to sort of collect

179
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:26,489
what's currently running in your users

180
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:28,889
machines the admin console an API that's

181
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:30,209
gonna give you a UI to see what users

182
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,329
have installed and also do some

183
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:34,919
configuration the the API is a fully

184
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:38,159
featured it can pull anything you need

185
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:40,558
from from the data that's in there and a

186
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:42,029
common one that we did was you give an

187
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:43,529
email address as a parameter and you get

188
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,289
a list of the extension IDs that the

189
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:47,969
user has you can also request extension

190
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:50,188
reports and get the numbers from those

191
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:53,689
and that's the third part so extension

192
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:56,519
reporting they've created a risk sort of

193
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:58,559
system where there's points applied for

194
00:07:56,519 --> 00:08:00,659
different different things and there's

195
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:03,989
an example of a now remove malicious

196
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:05,789
extension report you get multiple

197
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:07,318
versions so you quickly see it let's

198
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:09,719
change between versions you can view the

199
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,009
source you can also see how many ratings

200
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,179
and installs they have and based on

201
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,829
those numbers it can give you different

202
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:15,899
risk course you can kind of see like is

203
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:17,969
this a popular extension as it have low

204
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,789
ratings have only ten people installed

205
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:21,979
it there's a privacy policy things like

206
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,779
that

207
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:25,859
it also will show you a list of the

208
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,509
permissions that are there and this is

209
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:29,698
just part straight out of the manifest

210
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:31,889
JSON but they also gave you the risk

211
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,929
scores as well so you kind of see you

212
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:38,519
know what is this assumption asking for

213
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:41,218
and how serious is it so those are a

214
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,469
couple of the concerns that you might

215
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,670
have a different extensions we only

216
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,749
covered three different areas but

217
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,160
there's a lot of other ones out there

218
00:08:45,749 --> 00:08:49,500
that you might run into at your

219
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,630
companies you know those extensions that

220
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,160
are built for doing things with github

221
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,550
I might give access to your source code

222
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,829
if those were leaked your your PMS could

223
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,420
be using tools to do project management

224
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,710
and all miles elite like private

225
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,660
projects abuse third parties

226
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,210
but this will die a little bit more to

227
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,589
that in a second so sometimes when you

228
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,180
install extensions the first thing the

229
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,030
extension does it asked for an auth

230
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,699
grant and in this case a unnamed

231
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,079
extension which does email productivity

232
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,180
so sometimes people want to be more

233
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,010
productive so they install an extension

234
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,160
and they give access to all the data

235
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:26,020
that their account has to this extension

236
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,150
so the extensions can do things like

237
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,800
read all of the emails of the user they

238
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,230
can send emails they can delete emails

239
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,839
and do other things in this case it also

240
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,150
had access to your contacts you can read

241
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,160
them edit them delete them in some cases

242
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,910
we've seen them have access to even

243
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,100
Google Cloud Project stuff including

244
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,600
like you access to your infrastructure

245
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,130
but you know this is pretty concerning

246
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,990
to us we wouldn't want our contacts

247
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:54,390
calendars or org charts being

248
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:56,530
exfiltrated to free extensions so

249
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,569
something that most people don't read

250
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,430
because you know they may want to have

251
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,320
an extension they want to have it

252
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,510
installed right away they're not going

253
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,680
to read all the privacy policies they

254
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,140
just want to hit a button and then have

255
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,729
a cat show up in a new tab it's sort of

256
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,110
like they're you know it's fast like I

257
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,590
push that button get it installed I

258
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,270
don't care

259
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,800
but if you would if you actually read

260
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,090
the privacy policy which we did in a few

261
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,130
cases just to have a better

262
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,500
understanding of what these tools

263
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,510
actually did we talked about how they

264
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,640
share your data how they disclose it and

265
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,950
who they disclose it to so even if this

266
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,380
free extension that you're not paying

267
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,240
for is a great company and it secures

268
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,650
everything no that's nothing to say that

269
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,270
they don't get exploited and breached

270
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,650
and then your data is compromised but

271
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,390
then when you look at what they're

272
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,310
sharing it with the third parties those

273
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,800
companies can also be breached or be

274
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:47,349
potentially malicious there's also times

275
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,640
when companies will have sort of loose

276
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,290
agreements with other companies like

277
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,360
they can say that we sell things or we

278
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,770
share things with our affiliates and you

279
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,150
know we shake hands and now we're

280
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,310
affiliated so I'm gonna share all your

281
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:00,709
data with my friend here thank you

282
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,388
and we're always sure like legally what

283
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:04,819
that means but it's concerning because

284
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:07,310
it's your company's data and these fully

285
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:08,540
free tools have access to it so you know

286
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,739
we wouldn't want someone to share your

287
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,759
PII with outsiders

288
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,779
so jumping to the plan

289
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,430
so sorry for that now that we have

290
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,620
talked about all the problems with

291
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,449
Chrome extensions let's briefly talk

292
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:28,759
about what's our plan for addressing

293
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:30,769
them so I wanna on a high level what

294
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:33,379
that looks like is you know this was

295
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:35,480
presented here we start with gaining and

296
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:36,980
improving visibility it's means like you

297
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,189
can't fix what you can't see

298
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:43,699
so you started with how can we how can

299
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:46,219
we see what your users are using and yet

300
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:47,899
and you know exploring more into that we

301
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,290
define what's an acceptable risk for our

302
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:53,420
enterprise and create a policy out of it

303
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:56,899
the next step is actually enforcing that

304
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:59,689
policy and and after that iterating on

305
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:01,910
it based on input from stakeholders all

306
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:03,439
of this while reducing support and

307
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,540
operations cost because we are also

308
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:08,089
working on streamlining the software

309
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,579
users across the company when we do this

310
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:13,759
so this was our this was what I what we

311
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:16,609
had in mind initially and obviously the

312
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:19,279
first step is improving visibility in

313
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:21,079
our against that mean that meant getting

314
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,399
all the Chrome browsers into management

315
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:27,529
how do we see all the all the configs

316
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,329
all the extensions that the users has in

317
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,819
their in their individual browsers if

318
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:35,089
you have if you have g-suit and if you

319
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:37,309
have Chrome OS devices you're lucky all

320
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:40,100
of them are managed by default otherwise

321
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:42,019
you would probably need to use some sort

322
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,819
of endpoint management tool it can be

323
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:46,579
easy if you're using Windows environment

324
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:48,949
damn if you're using Mac environment to

325
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:51,589
push out a policy and that will bring

326
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:53,750
the like you know that can be used to

327
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:56,120
bring all the browsers in your your

328
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,730
fleet to management that will also let

329
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:03,679
you gain visibility into what extensions

330
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:05,480
your users have installed this is a sort

331
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,910
of a sample architecture for the the

332
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,120
whole workflow like we just talked about

333
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,319
you know if we have G suite environment

334
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,870
you bring all

335
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,640
them into visibility using one of the

336
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,770
methods that we talked about earlier we

337
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,020
pass all of that data into CR excavator

338
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:23,300
which is two that Chris talked about

339
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,490
earlier which gives you a risk snapshot

340
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,189
for each individual extensions that you

341
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,140
have installed in your company the data

342
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,150
from C our excavator is then passed into

343
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,480
some custom automates in the way that we

344
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:38,900
build in-house the automation is two

345
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,160
part the first part is cartography for

346
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,380
those of you who do not know about

347
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,329
cartography it's an open-source project

348
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,810
by lift that essentially lets you

349
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:50,450
visualize your infrastructure as scraps

350
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:52,729
and we open sourced a module for C our

351
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,710
excavator this year and you know which

352
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,920
lets you import all the data we use

353
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:00,830
cartography because it lets us see the

354
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,329
risk attribution so which orgs within

355
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,460
the company have highest amount of risk

356
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,230
so you can go ahead and tackle them in

357
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,260
the first place it also gives you an

358
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:11,930
ability to see the risk over time so

359
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,270
like how many unique installs your users

360
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,069
have at this point of time and how much

361
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,569
risk in videos like that kind of

362
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,050
questions can be answered by cartography

363
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:23,300
the other piece of automation was around

364
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:25,099
getting the workflow smooth like you

365
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,280
know is there if there's going to be a

366
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,900
request and review workflow can we give

367
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,720
enough information for reviewer to make

368
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:35,240
the decision as quickly as possible can

369
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,700
we make it easier for the user to time

370
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,100
into the process so all that information

371
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,650
goes to your workflow - it can be 0 or

372
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,060
it can be anything I won't agree you

373
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,730
know there's a caveat with this whole

374
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:49,609
process that you don't have a direct API

375
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,200
for extension management engine suite so

376
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:55,280
you have to go through a bunch of Hoops

377
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:57,320
to to accomplish this this is sort of a

378
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,240
blueprint of how we actually reduce the

379
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,700
risk for our Chrome extensions this was

380
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,710
the earlier slide present an overall

381
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,560
architecture this had - this is actual

382
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:08,560
approach to reducing the overall risk

383
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,530
within our company we obviously

384
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,819
collected list of extensions that we had

385
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:16,069
within the company after increasing

386
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,990
visibility of course in gaining

387
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,290
visibility into the entire company and

388
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:23,300
then you know we we had this policy of

389
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,849
you know what is an acceptable risk for

390
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,099
us and we also

391
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,499
to categorize them based on whether or

392
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,169
not they had a business justification

393
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:33,939
for for keeping them whether or not IT

394
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:35,529
had contracts with the vendor whether or

395
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:37,238
not we have some kind of data privacy

396
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,649
agreement with the vendors in place we

397
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:42,069
also looked at the risk score coming out

398
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:43,869
of C our excavator tool that Chris

399
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:46,209
mentioned earlier and we recommended a

400
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:48,759
list we went to the some of the teams

401
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:51,368
that are high-risk and you know give

402
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:53,079
them gave them all that all the details

403
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,609
we had like how much support and

404
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:56,789
operations cost can we reduce reduce

405
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:58,809
with this thing how house you know

406
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,639
software can be streamlined with this

407
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:02,069
project how much risk can be reduced

408
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,689
with this project and all sort of

409
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:07,689
details that you know of the ins and

410
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:09,248
outs of the project and then we partner

411
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:11,889
with the teams we get leadership

412
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:14,049
approval for the worst case scenario you

413
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:17,259
know in case in case there's a revote

414
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:19,720
and we we just don't want to get the

415
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:21,850
leaders in on board but also the entire

416
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,069
company and we want everybody to feel

417
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,289
like the part of the process so you know

418
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:30,728
we give out comps early and often and

419
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:31,959
let people have a say so we have any

420
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:33,699
automated the review process like I

421
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:36,579
mentioned earlier you know the from

422
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:38,319
installation request to automatically

423
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:41,349
declining the requests that have already

424
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:42,839
been reviewed and disapproved we are we

425
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,519
automatically decline them so that it

426
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,009
dramatically reduces the operational

427
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,019
cost associated with this so if some

428
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:51,639
fall through the cracks and come from

429
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:54,970
comfort manual review we want to make

430
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:57,850
the process ads as smooth as possible

431
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:01,779
for reviewer with with the run box with

432
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,309
the risk category Jason and you know so

433
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:04,959
in general we want to make decision

434
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:08,019
making process easier for the reviewer

435
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,759
if there is if there is a need so what

436
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:12,309
does that look like for our individual

437
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,659
user so if you're a user and trying to

438
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:15,428
install in extensions that has not been

439
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:17,529
approved or that doesn't have a business

440
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,539
use case you know and you're visiting

441
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:23,500
Chrome App Store you would see a pop-up

442
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:25,509
like this which we would ask users to

443
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,939
provide business justification for the

444
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:30,610
for the particular extension that

445
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:32,980
they're trying to install and you know

446
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,178
it comes back to the reviewer

447
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,039
with all the information they need to

448
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,290
make the decision including business

449
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,750
justification we can

450
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,659
we close this tickets tickets out if the

451
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,130
extensions has already been removed and

452
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,780
and whether or not you know certain risk

453
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,290
threshold are made but that might be

454
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:52,970
different from company to company and

455
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:55,409
and we we implemented this policy across

456
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,140
you know initially we implemented this

457
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,490
on thousand plus employees within our

458
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,140
company and we're able to reduce the

459
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,230
number of unique from extensions by

460
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,180
about 95% this is in a very operational

461
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,150
state which requires some legwork

462
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,760
initially but the the operational

463
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:15,660
overhead is very little now we barely

464
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,810
spend you know a few hours and even

465
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,820
lesser than that maintaining this so

466
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,560
this is not this is the approach that we

467
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,060
took but this is not the approach that

468
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,919
you have to take there are some

469
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,070
different approaches that you can take

470
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,950
for accomplishing the same thing that is

471
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:34,889
reduction of risk that's that's stemming

472
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:37,790
from Chrome extensions so some of those

473
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,840
approaches you know are listed here so

474
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,850
the first approach is disapproved

475
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,800
domains that means you can create a list

476
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:47,730
of domains that you think are sensitive

477
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,070
and you can block the extensions to to

478
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,020
be able to run in them which means you

479
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,540
can let users install whatever they want

480
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,030
but you have to create you have to

481
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,560
create a list of domains that you you

482
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,410
know that you find sensitive in your

483
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,360
environment and just not let the

484
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,540
extensions run on them the other

485
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,000
approach is disapproved permissions

486
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,710
which means you let users install

487
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,240
whatever they want but the extension

488
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,920
cannot ask for certain kind of

489
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,050
permission so if the extension asked for

490
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,330
some kind of permission one minute what

491
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,280
may install and on the device or you can

492
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,840
follow the approach that we took

493
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,639
you know approving or blocking

494
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,159
extensions each of these approaches have

495
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,680
its own caveats you know like for

496
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,920
example for disapproving permissions we

497
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:35,580
felt we felt like the D permissions that

498
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,650
we can block from the list of permission

499
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,659
that we can block wasn't comprehensive

500
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,070
enough for us so if we want to say you

501
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,700
know we just want to block every

502
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:46,320
extension that has a certain permission

503
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,800
you know it we couldn't find it on on

504
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,330
the on the available list of offsets

505
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,980
also I'm

506
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,840
on an environment where you have a lot

507
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,630
of sass tools or different tools that

508
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,490
might contain sensitive data keeping a

509
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,290
list of disapproved domains might not be

510
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,210
very feasible so based on what kind of

511
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,100
you know needs and requirements and risk

512
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,570
appetite you have you can use one of

513
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:11,060
these approaches to to reduce the risk

514
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,540
so to briefly summarize what we talked

515
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,220
about

516
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,330
Chrome extensions have a lot of unknown

517
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:20,150
risks you know that have not been

518
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:22,399
reviewed in-depth particularly in an

519
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,260
enterprise like ours we know we had to

520
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,900
uncover we uncovered a lot of issues and

521
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:30,410
then we had to dig down on what the

522
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,630
risks from these extensions are and

523
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,250
there there is a path forward there's a

524
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,490
path forward to reduce all of these

525
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:40,490
risks and you can decide on what method

526
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:43,370
to take based on what your risk appetite

527
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,410
is and what fits best for you obviously

528
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,540
this would not be this cannot be

529
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,860
accomplished without support from your

530
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:53,500
teams and leadership so we were you know

531
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:56,360
the way we did it was partnering with

532
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:00,980
individual teams and getting their

533
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:03,350
leaders and team members to buy in there

534
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:06,290
are some of the helpful links that we

535
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:08,350
referenced in our talk today the stock

536
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:11,120
will probably be uploaded to resize

537
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:15,939
websites so you might get a handle of

538
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,939
this later unless we have any questions

539
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:26,939
thank you

540
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,940
