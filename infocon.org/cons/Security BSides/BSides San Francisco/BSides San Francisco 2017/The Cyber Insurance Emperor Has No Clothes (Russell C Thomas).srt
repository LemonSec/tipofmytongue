functional and operational standpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

40
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,990
the second preliminary<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not here</font>

41
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,719
to bash<font color="#CCCCCC"> insurance companies or insurance</font>

45
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,630
so whether you're here in person or you

46
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">here virtually or you hear about this</font>

47
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,680
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> there may be other domains where</font>

48
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,959
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> complain about the insurance</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">companies this is not one of them</font>

50
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:31,360
so what I'm really here to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:35,140
not the risk transfer function of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

52
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,420
insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly valid function that</font>

53
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,480
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> its own business case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm really</font>

54
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,000
here to talk about the incentive and

55
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:51,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk pricing function of cyber insurance</font>

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:54,670
so where did this notion of<font color="#CCCCCC"> insurances</font>

57
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:55,959
incentives come about anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it</font>

58
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,420
actually started out in the early

59
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,510
eighteen<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundreds it happens to be the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">economist Jeremy Bentham</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when they</font>

62
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:10,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">rewards and punishments basically boiled</font>

63
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,870
down to some combination of carrots and

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,670
sticks and Bentham and other people came

65
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,709
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> and their theory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of human behavior</font>

66
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,869
is if you get the right combination of

67
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,850
carrots and sticks<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in society</font>

68
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,350
going to do what you want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

69
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:27,850
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

70
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:29,590
so this theme<font color="#E5E5E5"> has carried forward and if</font>

71
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,380
any of you have been to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

insurance is potentially good because it

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,179
provides positive incentives<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:55,450
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's something problematic about</font>

simplifying it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that level and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font>

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,920
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to present the point of</font>

challenges

92
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:27,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">so the point of presenting that is</font>

93
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,860
simply an academic or an idealized

94
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,600
notion of carrots and sticks can be

95
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,470
quite problematic when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're in the</font>

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,420
hands of any particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization or</font>

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:42,880
any particular institution to implement

98
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:45,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">so where did this idea come from that</font>

99
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,950
insurance would be a good incentive and

100

information system for risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduction</font>

recommending<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quotes on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the technical people are frequently</font>

280
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,490
very revealing

281
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,100
so the risk managers themselves that are

282
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,230

285
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,390
the technical people<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the technical</font>

286

287
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,290
often they don't even see the value in

288
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,510
the exercise and appeared to me from the

289
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,089
survey the technical people get involved

290
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:40,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it comes to filling out the surveys</font>

295
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,870
I think that's further supporting the

296
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,779
idea that we don't have the right people

297

299
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:03,220
with cyber insurance coverage that

301
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,100
the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to our problem</font>

these things your premiums will go down

313
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">well let's look at what the survey says</font>

314
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,120
about that

315
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:54,910
so first of all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 203 people only</font>

those<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty percent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the insurance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

319
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,709
bundled with a whole bunch of other

320
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,750
things

321
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:12,550
now think about that for a second<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

322
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,910
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a comprehensive corporate</font>

324
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,370
and omissions

325
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:22,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">property and casualty a whole bunch of</font>

326
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:25,070
other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> how big and how important is</font>

327
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,650
the cyber insurance signal in there

328
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:30,740
about how big your premiums going up and

329
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:32,540
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> so at least one-third of the people</font>

330
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,180
are not getting a very good signal out

331
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,980
of this in the first place and then the

332
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,959
question is well what happens to that

333
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,540
signal at all

334
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,090
well some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will say well in order</font>

335
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,230
to qualify for cyber insurance in the

336
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,880
first place

337
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've got to bring your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber security</font>

338
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,740
up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certain level</font>

339
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,780
well here's a survey of underwriters

340
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens to be a hundred ninety four of</font>

341
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:59,630
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's all the things that they</font>

00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,010

344
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:06,080
well this looks like a decent what you

345
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:09,439
might call<font color="#E5E5E5"> hygiene list but I don't know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ante</font>

353
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,550
we can't really make a claim that it's

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:30,500
taking you to any level of excellence

355
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:34,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's a similar set of questions</font>

356
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:36,380
which is to me what's most important

357
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,770
what changes did you make in your

358

<font color="#E5E5E5">organization because you engage with or</font>

361
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,530
be good or could be meaningless

362
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:58,340
depending upon what those policies and

363
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:59,750
processes are so the last element<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:10,430
just one headline<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've seen recently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so there's lots of factors to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drive</font>

383
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,629
lots of debate in this industry whether

384
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,360
it's going to turn out to be cyclical

385
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:02,570
like property and casualty or it's going

386
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,080
to be stable but the whole notion that

387
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:08,540
premium prices or coverages themselves

388
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,169
are going to be a good reliable signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

different institutional structure could

438
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,630

<font color="#E5E5E5">they're trying to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well cyber</font>

466
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,379
insurance is like all these other lines

467
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:26,969
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to invest in it and</font>

we're going to grow<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by the way</font>

469
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,810
that's why you see some people wanting

470
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,780
to have a government mandate for

471
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:43,500
insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drive adoption right</font>

472
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:45,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so the second point about hygiene in</font>

00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,880
other presentations<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have had some</font>

case could be made that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got it drain</font>

there are better ways and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I certainly</font>

wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> claim that the major social</font>
