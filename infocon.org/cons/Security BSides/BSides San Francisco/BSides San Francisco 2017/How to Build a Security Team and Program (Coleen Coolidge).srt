00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,010
have a ton of risk and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through</font>

the exercise of<font color="#E5E5E5"> prioritizing them and</font>

102
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,770
it was really hard to get my message

across<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought what the hell is it</font>

104
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,219
why don't they take this seriously this

is their company

106
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,110
well the problem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was having was I</font>

us out with and here's how you can

146
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:18,060
unlock new markets with doing what I say

147
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,980
or if you forget to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is how you</font>

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,780
can stay out of the headlines and here's

a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> other companies that didn't do</font>

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,070
exactly this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,460
listen

156
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:41,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so now this is a little bit more</font>

157
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,630
like the relationship we have it took a

158
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,300
very long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> was about two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half</font>

159
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,650
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure they actually hated me</font>

160
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">they probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complain about me behind</font>

161
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,750
closed doors<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know there was one</font>

162
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,810
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's gunning for me for sure but</font>

163
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,850
he's quiet now and it is because we've

164
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,220
been able to tie<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

165
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,340
team together to what we can get

166
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

167
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so on the other part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of keeping</font>

168
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">them out of trouble because they're very</font>

169
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,049
very concerned about this exact<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they</font>

170
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,049
go looking for a job it's actually very

171
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,580
hard for them to find another job for

172
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,620
security people<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think that's crazy</font>

173
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,349
like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I quit my job today my boss just</font>

00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,330
better title etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not the case for</font>

178
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,070
them if they go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and employee</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

179
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,780
something really bad happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could</font>

180
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,599
take them six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a year to find</font>

181
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,530
another job<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they must stay out of</font>

182
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,380
trouble

183
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,380

our personal opinions on this and i

189
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">vacillate on it myself because it's that</font>

190
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,179
basic understanding

191
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:19,509
don't you care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your users and</font>

192
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,830
security and your company<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do care</font>

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:27,460
different way<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've struggled with</font>

195
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:30,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">this because this person vp of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

196
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried to tell her things that were wrong</font>

197
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">scent that prioritized list up there and</font>

198
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,419
said we need to fix a<font color="#E5E5E5"> B and C and those</font>

199
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,279
things didn't get funded and they didn't

200
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,348
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> fixed and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> person's left and</font>

201
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,110
went for a better job and a better title

202
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,880
but this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six because</font>

203
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,800
if you use any yahoo products you

205
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:54,430
executed for the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want us to</font>

206
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,250
operate is we have security people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

207
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,979
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> communication and the response we</font>

message that you put together if it gets

211
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,250
that kind of a response

212
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:11,589
you need to get some help on<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

213
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,570
reconfiguring that message because she's

about the same things that we do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

221
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,030
bet you've already done a gap analysis

222
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,520
in your area<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably have a</font>

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,930
prioritized list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this happens and</font>

224
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,189
this happens if this happens with

<font color="#E5E5E5">companies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dead</font>

226
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:44,690
everything is dead we're all going to

227
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,100
find new jobs<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did they ever</font>

228
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,430
listened to you when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented that</font>

229
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,230
maybe they probably thought you know

230
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:55,130
what security people do security people

231
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,540
scare people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they do what we have</font>

232
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,820
to do to make it seem like we weren't

233
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,740
using scare tactics was we took that

234
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">prioritized list which we thought was</font>

235
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:08,420
just gold and then we spent a hundred

236
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,280
thousand dollars with<font color="#CCCCCC"> pwc buddies and</font>

237
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,189
they did the same gap analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> they went</font>

238
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:17,209
through they did a maturity model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lo</font>

239
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:20,840
and behold<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours and there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look so</font>

240
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:23,420
much alike<font color="#CCCCCC"> i felt good spending the</font>

241
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,390
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the most important thing was</font>

242
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:29,150
when you have external validation of the

243
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,010
stuff you've been saying all along<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

244
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,670
means they can no longer ignore the

problem

246
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:36,410
so once you have the mama hook<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's</font>
