way

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know about it you need to</font>

36
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:42,170
figure out how to handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,298
typically in my experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

38
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,369
people will focus on the technical

39
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,630
aspects of response which is great

40
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:51,020
two thumbs<font color="#CCCCCC"> up you should totally do that</font>

41
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's kind of your job but there is a</font>

42
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,810
lot more to it than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and coming out</font>

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,430
the other side

44
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,710
depends on how you can handle the other

45
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,920
pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the other pieces are what we</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about and i just realized in</font>

53
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:28,049
nice story how we fell in love<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

54
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,800
crises<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright with that terrifying</font>

55
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,660
thought

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going to move on because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just runs</font>

57
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,540
out of here screaming<font color="#CCCCCC"> come ok so the</font>

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,870
basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> gist</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is there are five main</font>

59
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:43,350
elements to how you deal with the

60
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,300
communication side of a crisis<font color="#E5E5E5"> that last</font>

61
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,549
one is you need to make a plan

62
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,020
the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage</font>

63
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,670
your stakeholders that's a really

64
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,260
important one and it's really hard to do

65
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can make or break situation</font>

66
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,709
the third is that you need to monitor

67
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,089
the situation we're going to go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

68
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">of even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> details but don't worry this</font>

69
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,060
isn't it<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

70
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,510
pie

71
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,890
you need to input<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your internal team</font>

72
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,090
and then you need to inform those

73
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,220
affected which is the thing that

74
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,490
everyone focuses on so everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> focuses</font>

75
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,050
on that last point and there's a lot

76
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,090
more to it than that so we're going to

77
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,470
talk about why and how

78
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,140
so I'm going to hand over to my

79
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,510
glamorous assistance we started falling

80
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,049
in love well before any<font color="#E5E5E5"> crisis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">closer to my mouth</font>

82
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:32,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is this is interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet haha so</font>

83
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i first started working in</font>

84
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i remember of people</font>

85
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,980
telling us you need to have your

86
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,019
incident response plan and it was like

87
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,359
this 80<font color="#E5E5E5"> page document that you would</font>

88
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:46,080
refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever something went wrong</font>

89
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,940
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i quickly figured out that it just</font>

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,290
doesn't work like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80-page</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

91
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,420
response plan doesn't work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

92
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,170
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jen and i started working</font>

like to admit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it was disorganized</font>

97
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">at best and what we quickly figured out</font>

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,410
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> by like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of</font>

135
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,920
cool thing about this and the reason we

00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,050
like using this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> when i sent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this to</font>

other things that aren't relevant to the

145
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:56,450
story and what we did what I did

146

<font color="#E5E5E5">mistakingly was put social media media</font>

couple of hours to put together and

this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a forcing function for you</font>

185
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,200
like this means you're going to figure

186
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,220
out who the key players are<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font>

going to build a relationship with them

and that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

go take them out for lunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn about</font>

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,580
who they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what they</font>

that triggers<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to know how to work</font>

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

195
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,640
that means that when you get handed a

196
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,770
thing like this to look at and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chart</font>

197
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's wrong</font>

198
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're much less likely to you know</font>

203
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:00,650
so another really scary diagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when</font>

204
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,360
we talk about writing process flows

205
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,870
instead of having you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 pages</font>

206
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:09,800
explaining what this is this for us is a

207
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:12,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guidebook</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right it is not necessarily</font>

208
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">a prescriptive set of things that have</font>

209
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,820
to happen and and has to happen in the

210
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,950
in this order<font color="#CCCCCC"> but what it does is when</font>

211
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,960
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> were in the heat of the moment we</font>

212
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,130
have a way that we can pull out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

213
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">document to make sure we're not missing</font>

214
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,830
something

215
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,600
if we've made a mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font>

216
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,479
that we want to improve on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a previous</font>

217
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">crisis we have a way of capturing it on</font>

218
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,479
and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> importantly what it</font>

219
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,400
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it left stakeholders visualize</font>

220
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,110
what's going to happen right so again if

221
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,328
you send somebody an 80-page<font color="#CCCCCC"> document</font>

222
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're never going to read it</font>

223
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:43,539
they might tell you they read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

224
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,579
read a few pages<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you send them a flow</font>

225
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,259
diagram like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from 60</font>

226
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:50,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">seconds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two hundred twenty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds to</font>

227
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:52,239
really look<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look through it and and</font>

228
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">gather an opinion that way when</font>

229
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:55,779
something happens hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have</font>

230
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,998
<font color="#E5E5E5">identified a box down here where they</font>

231
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:59,769
say something like actually this team

232
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:01,029
doesn't do that you know my team does

233
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:03,279
that and so instead of having that

234
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:07,480
conversation in the midst of crisis

235
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,910
you can do it via email and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just</font>

236
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">just add so I not only does this help</font>

237
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,079
you figure out what the process should

238
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:17,019
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who's doing what</font>

239
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:19,209
but actually it will make you much more

240
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:20,709
productive<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will make you less stress</font>

241
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:23,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">so when Josh and I started doing</font>

a little bit we want and love that you

254
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:55,929
it took a lot of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> now what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

this is critical for a number of reasons

<font color="#E5E5E5">and one of those is lawsuits so there is</font>

a reputation aspect of this where you

00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,710
marketing social media is extremely

369
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,450
important from that point of view

370
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:37,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a secondary consideration</font>

what's happening in social media because

375
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,450
anything that gets shared publicly can

00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:33,360
external communications and that's

421
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,720
really important and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

to that but your internal team<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the trenches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,270
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're the most invested in</font>

freak out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're doing that thing</font>

428
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,840
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked about earlier where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

429
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,490
kind of going off into rooms and having

430
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,830
very stressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking private</font>

431
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,300
conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> your team is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not stupid</font>

432
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,040
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to motor /</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and they're</font>

433
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna be like all something happens and</font>

434
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

435
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,170
is coming to an end and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

436
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">start speculating and gossiping this is</font>

437
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad news</font>

438
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,230
so firstly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to think about how</font>

439
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:12,060
you're presenting yourself to that team

440
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,520
and you have to you know do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dark</font>

441
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,708
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling of gliding on the surface and</font>

442
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">paddling like hell underneath the second</font>

443
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,830
thing is you have to think very

444
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,670
carefully about when you're going to

445
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,829
disclose the internal team and

446
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:26,140
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> their mind once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he disclosed</font>

447
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:29,050
internally to the broad team like all of

448
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,430
your colleagues that is now public<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

449
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,129
cannot trust those people to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

450
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:35,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">private it won't happen it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now public</font>

451
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">so you have to make your timing very</font>

452
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,620
carefully measured and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to think</font>

453
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what to share with them if you</font>

454
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,310
share information before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've mailed</font>

455
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,470
the fact you will probably cause

456
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,129
confusion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will come back and bite</font>

457
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,040
your mouth

458
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:51,520
we've had that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

459
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:54,460
share what happens but you don't prepare

460
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,050
them to get questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> then that's going</font>

461
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,190
to be difficult because their customers

462
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,659
are going to be phoning<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font>

463
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,650
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their and</font>

on the phone in the heat of the moment

466
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:07,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FAQ</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is your best</font>

467
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,010
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you want to think about what</font>

468
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,620
all the worst questions you're going to

469
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,840
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really push yourself to like</font>

470
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,790
think about those<font color="#CCCCCC"> naughty questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

471
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,409
we write these things frequently people

472
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:20,530
get offended by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I put</font>

in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm always take it wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

474
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,710
for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what other people are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

475
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,120
ask us and we need to be prepared with

476
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,430
an answer like hopefully we don't get

your<font color="#CCCCCC"> comms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people to help them figure</font>

484
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,450
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that most people care about</font>

485
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,840
which is the external communication

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are a number of a of elements to</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> people tend to focus on press</font>

488
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:57,130
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the really scary thing</font>

489
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first step on this though is what</font>

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:02,020
are your legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements for</font>

with them and understand what the

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,320
expectations are<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you handle into the</font>

response in your organization you should

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,320
also be familiar with them and know what

the expectations are

499
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,370
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing you have to think</font>

500
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,830
about how you're going to notify those

501

affected<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can start thinking</font>

502
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,330
about what that means in terms of press

503
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:30,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">and partners and social media and all</font>

those other pieces and again

<font color="#E5E5E5">timing here is critical if you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will do more harm than good</font>

507
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:40,430
and you'll create confusion and panic<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

have a situation where we didn't create

years ago and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're doing the</font>

512
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,409
investigation<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got some information</font>

that indicated the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack may have</font>

happened by<font color="#CCCCCC"> facts and people kind of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was funny and cool and so</font>

516
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:06,469
we tweeted it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> like taxes weren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involved and</font>

520
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,190
it was much more mundane how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they done</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it and and then we couldn't take it back</font>

about it

all of the stakeholders really

right to that thing they don't want me

going to be in is

618
