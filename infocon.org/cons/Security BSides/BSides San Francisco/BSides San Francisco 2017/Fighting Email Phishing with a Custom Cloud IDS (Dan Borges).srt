see three different emails being parsed

in what looks like two seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

81
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:26,139
you can basically just write code and

00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:29,560
deploy it and then it does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> auto</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">scaling but what is really difficult</font>

84
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,970
with this is that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is a related campaign</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so again this is a</font>

134
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,729
really nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyst tool that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

135
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,720
comes with it

136
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:23,390
so what we're seeing here is that

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,190
phantom application<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-end basically</font>

138
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,479
we get all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> normalized alerts</font>

139
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,910
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they go to the single pane of</font>

140
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,500
glass and then we can have people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

141
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit review and look at these alerts and</font>

142
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,210
say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> initiate some type of</font>

143
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,270
manual action<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what we're looking at</font>

144
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,760
here is actually a dynamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> a malware</font>

145
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,590
analysis alert<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we had a sandbox trip</font>

146
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,060
on a piece of malware and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's saying</font>

147
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,849
you know it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> bringing the alert</font>

148
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,470
and what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyst gets her the the</font>

149
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,570
engineer<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoever's looking at this alert</font>

150
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they get automatically is tons of</font>

151
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,950
enrichment and context around<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit so we</font>

152
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,140
can see you right away we have reversing

153
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,479
labs results<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virustotal results</font>

154
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,979
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer widgets which tell us</font>

155
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:03,020
how many times we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever seen this file</font>

156
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:05,300
before we have our dynamic sandbox

157
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,549
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have endpoint agents which</font>

158
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,500
tell us you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this file has never hit</font>

159
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,410
the fleet and then we even built a

160
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,780
custom<font color="#CCCCCC"> widgets for our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email ideas so</font>

161
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">excuse me this tells us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this email came</font>

162
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,960
through the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> later we have two</font>

00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,540
recipients<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> received this this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

164
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,210
the time they received it and who would

165
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,680
have been from<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's extremely</font>

166
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,299
helpful when you're just trying to get

167
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,010
an eyeball view of the problem hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

168
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,479
have this you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> malware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

169
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,669
fleet<font color="#E5E5E5"> where did it come from</font>

170
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:34,070
not only that but then we have the

171
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:35,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">playbooks which go look up that alert in</font>

172
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,729
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> elastic search and then reach back</font>

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,560
to that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> three container grabbing that</font>

174
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong email and attaching it to the hit</font>

175
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,750
this is extremely useful for analysis

176
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,479
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they can look at this</font>

177
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong email and say was this a fish was</font>

178
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's not a fish now you know that that</font>

179
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,420
creates<font color="#CCCCCC"> a myriad of problems because you</font>

180
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,460
could still have malware and not

181
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,100
necessarily a fish<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's really</font>

182
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,479
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information to understand</font>

183
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,340
because that means you know maybe your

00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,750
third-party vendor whoever you're

185
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,099
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to fish you but</font>

186
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:08,980
they've been compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we can</font>

187
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:11,590
also take a user<font color="#E5E5E5"> guided actions from</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Phantom so here's a user taking that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">email this is actually an email that</font>

came in through our fishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're taking that email and then</font>

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're deleting it for this one user on</font>

193
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> redacted the users for our own</font>

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,330
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in this case they're able to</font>

195
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:31,539
delete the email from that users<font color="#CCCCCC"> inbox</font>

196
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:34,510
we also run our own<font color="#CCCCCC"> plant fishing</font>

197
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:37,180
assessments to help raise your awareness

198
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:40,060
and user education this is one we had

199
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:43,300
actually run a while back<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

200
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,610
case we had gone back and now we have

201
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,919
the ability to programmatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> tag all</font>

202
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,350
of these emails that came<font color="#E5E5E5"> through our</font>

203
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">ids with fishing labels</font>

204
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,890
this is really nice because this

205
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,860
actually moves it out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:59,950

208
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,490
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas false-positive we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,030
least containing it and letting them

211
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:12,760
know we programmatically detected this

212
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:14,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">may be a phishing attack not only do we</font>

213
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,080
have these alerts<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our analyst console</font>

214
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,030
but we need to receive them<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

215
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,200
team is a heavy user of<font color="#E5E5E5"> chat ops we</font>

216
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,020
really kind of believe in that

217
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,280
methodology<font color="#E5E5E5"> we live in our chat consoles</font>

218
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,400
but then we also do a lot of analysis

219
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,349
and programmatic<font color="#E5E5E5"> actions right from chat</font>

220
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">so what we're seeing here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phantom</font>

221
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,510
actually alerted our chat that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

222
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">display name fish for those of you that</font>

223
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,069
are unaware<font color="#CCCCCC"> displayname fishes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are when</font>

224
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,229
somebody registers a legitimate common

225
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,960
email address such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gmail or hotmail</font>

226
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">but then they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set their their username</font>

227
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">or their common name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as an executive or</font>

228
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,479
somebody in your company that's really

229
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,550
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just try to social</font>

230
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,769
engineer somebody into giving them some

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an extremely powerful</font>

232
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:58,149
tactic because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard to identify</font>

233
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,430
because it relies on just social

234
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:03,190
engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> tactics so in this case</font>

235
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:06,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're in chat we get this high high</font>

236
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">severity alert and we can instantly just</font>

237
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,649
click the alert<font color="#CCCCCC"> it launches our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> console</font>

238
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:14,199
and then boom there's the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> attached</font>

239
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:16,899
right to the alert<font color="#CCCCCC"> so now i just went</font>

240
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,700
from chat<font color="#CCCCCC"> to triaging this in seconds</font>

241
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:22,060
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can quickly tell this is a false</font>

242
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:25,269
positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was easy to whitelist</font>

243
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:27,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">but this is actually an example of a</font>

244
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:30,550
true positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> so here we have somebody</font>

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:34,180
impersonating<font color="#CCCCCC"> travis kalanick who is the</font>

emailing somebody in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

254
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,810
were able to call the recipient of this

257
00:09:54,279 --> 00:10:00,760
we just made sure they didn't act on

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:03,550
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so those are some of the things and</font>

259
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,439
and how we respond to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then we</font>

260
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:07,599
also see fish that we haven't planned

for that we don't have rules for in our

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,880
you guys should be aware of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

267
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,970
we do there is we go and we review these

268
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">arm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know every few weeks and we make</font>

269
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,029
sure that we can then see these in the

270
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">ids moving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

271
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is you know your classic hunting</font>

272
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:33,279
and then writing signatures your bread

273
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,770
and butter of really detection and

274
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,260
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> so here we had an email that</font>

275
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,880
came in through<font color="#E5E5E5"> our efficient cube and</font>

276
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,209
this was really easy to write a rule on

277
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,160
because our email ids already<font color="#E5E5E5"> parses all</font>

278
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">this information so we can already like</font>

279
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:52,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">programmatically said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the hyperlink</font>

280
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:54,579
in that Dom right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here we have a HTML</font>

281
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,550
hyperlink and the actual link itself

282
00:10:54,579 --> 00:11:00,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">points to a different URL than the</font>

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,260
display of the hyperlink<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you have to</font>

284
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,000
do is check the protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure it's</font>

285
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">a full URL and it's a different</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">main</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a really easy alert that</font>

287
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,579
you can prevent other people from ever

288
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:14,860
seeing this is a another one where we

289
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,660
went back and we hunted and we have this

290
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">google a player and were like you know</font>

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,020
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gmail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really be</font>

292
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,150
preventing us from receiving all this

293
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">family stuff but we ended up getting</font>

294
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,550
these messages anyway which still

295
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,790
contained<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing links so we then</font>

296
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,189
added a<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parsing of these hello</font>

297
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,110

298
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,210
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> ids and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we were able to harness</font>

299
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,830
all of these other intelligence services

300
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,410
that we are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">organization and reuse that value in our</font>

302
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:47,800
ideas just by parsing<font color="#E5E5E5"> another field of</font>

303
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:49,750
the protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> so again we had this you</font>

304
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,140
know a few hundred dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few hundred</font>

306
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,040
we got so much more power out of just

307
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,680
rewriting these tools and parsing the

308
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,060
basic structures ourselves and then just

309
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,550
reusing these other intelligence

310
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:09,849
services we already had<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus having</font>

311
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:12,670
all this siloed<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment we also set up</font>

312
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,470
some advanced intelligence services<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

313
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:19,000
what you're seeing is an example here

314
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:20,800
where we were able to basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect</font>

315
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,300
people standing up<font color="#E5E5E5"> new fishing sites</font>

316
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,479
against us and then we could actually

317
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,729
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> victims falling for these sites</font>

318
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> near-real-time this is pretty huge</font>

319
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,350
because it lets us get in front of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 88</font>

320
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,850
accounts we can understand when<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

322
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,650
when are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the victims of our our</font>

329
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,350
example of a website which was running

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">where we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to definite that</font>

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,620
also look up those people in our own

343
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,420
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> quantify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> potentially how much</font>

investigations to take those people to a

law enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> so a quick review</font>

347
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:42,880
basically if if you take the extra time

348
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> parse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocols yourself and</font>

to to write these rules on the fly

354
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,870
then we can stay very current on

attacker trends and attacker

catch those campaigns in the wild as

<font color="#CCCCCC">their targeting us</font>

00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,959
another hundred grand for one of these

365
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,630
boxes were able to reuse all that value

we already have on and apply it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

376
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:58,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah the presentations are going to get</font>

377
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">release later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this week and then we're</font>

378
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,310
also planning on<font color="#CCCCCC"> open sourcing this</font>

379
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,890
project

380
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,779
there's two major<font color="#CCCCCC"> roads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> milestones until</font>

381
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,060
we can open sources right now we're

382
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,860
working on decoupling the rules from the

383
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,260
actual infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> so then people can</font>

384
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,720
also share<font color="#CCCCCC"> the email and fishing rules</font>

385
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:17,839
for current campaigns<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be nice and</font>

386
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we also want to terraform the whole</font>

387
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:25,579
thing much like stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> alert so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

388
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:34,370
easy to deploy for anybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

389
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:35,359
right

390
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,540
the question is how do we store

391
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,070
sensitive data<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't go into a hundred</font>

392
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,290
percent of our details but we have

393
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,810
numerous controls we had the controls

394
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:47,149
reviewed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> sister groups in the</font>

395
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:49,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you that no</font>

396
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:51,980
human like I can't go access any wrong

397
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,779
email only the programmatic systems can

398
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,500
do that and then attach it to the things

399
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:58,970
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't even have that access and not</font>

401
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,930
myself and like the whole team but we

402
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:05,089
wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> alerts on the controls for people</font>

403
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,560
to get that access<font color="#E5E5E5"> so anybody want to</font>

404
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,980
change those controls<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will be alerted</font>

405
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-time</font>

406
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so in in that regard we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

407
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,760
strip some of the content from the email

408
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:22,850
so that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> animals only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets some of</font>

the content relevant to the alert<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're only receiving that one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">relevant to the alert on and then on top</font>

413
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:32,959
of that like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was saying those can only</font>

414
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:35,529
access programmatically from automated

systems

416
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question was how do we deal with an</font>

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,329
analyst<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming across</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sensitive</font>

necessarily seen that exact case<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

420
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:01,839
usually in those cases we<font color="#E5E5E5"> whitelist</font>

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:04,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever that content was so we will</font>

never see it again<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that with</font>

00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:09,309
almost all of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> false positives just</font>

as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good sense of ideas hygiene</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font>

425
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:28,990
way it doesn't keep showing up and we

426
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:30,699
don't have a lot of noise question<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

427
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,549
now we're doing ourselves and it's very

428
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,290
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> beijing classifiers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's nothing</font>

431
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,659
able to parse the bodies and then

432
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,309
hopefully look<font color="#CCCCCC"> towards the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> third party</font>

433
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> specializes in that kind of stuff</font>

434
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:47,678

435
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">write so many alerts on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> URLs but we</font>

436
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,000
look towards vendors that<font color="#CCCCCC"> specialize in</font>

437
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,820
like ad hominem domains or newly

438
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,650
registered domains<font color="#CCCCCC"> so right now that</font>

439
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff kind of proof of concept but i'll</font>
