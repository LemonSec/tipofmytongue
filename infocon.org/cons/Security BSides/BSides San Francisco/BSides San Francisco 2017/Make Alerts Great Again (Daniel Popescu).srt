these common pitfalls of alerting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're no different at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yelp we fell into</font>

of these problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> are lack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> available</font>

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,280
lot of the alerts were going over email

and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when when you send alerts /</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no standardization a lot of the</font>

times

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,078
some people think things are certain

things are really important other things

87

people think things are not very

88
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:00,879
important some people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails find</font>

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,040
some people want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to page for everything</font>

90
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,989
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens so there's no standards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

91
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,150
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

92
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,849
functional correctness<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a big</font>

93
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,959
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> so how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you have tested</font>

94
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,918
all of your alerts and you know that

95
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,169
they all work

96
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah that's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought so that's a</font>

97
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:19,329
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and false positives are</font>

98
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,548
obviously a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

99
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,620
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yelp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our alerts are not</font>

100
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:26,500
necessarily rainbows and unicorns

101
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,050
probably nobody's are but we have a

102
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,070
pretty good system that works for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

103
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to share some of those details</font>

104
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,229
with you so for us we have historical

105
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,180
metrics on all of our alerts<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know how</font>

106
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:39,340
many alerts that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we keep our</font>

107
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,639
alerts actionable by assigning ownership

108
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,679
to all of those alerts and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

109
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">incident response steps for all of the</font>

110
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,180
alerts that we have defined and we're

111
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,419
pretty sure that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our alerts are</font>

112
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:54,250
functionally correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> so let me walk you</font>

113
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,630
through some of the problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or</font>

114
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">walking through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the solutions</font>

115
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,650
that we came to get to the almost

116
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,380
rainbows and unicorns land

117
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the first problem is lack of</font>

118
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,150
visibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for us we have alerts that</font>

119
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,220
are defined across multiple different

120
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,789
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them are defined in</font>

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,550

122
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:16,930
top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> elasticsearch so the problem</font>

123
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,240
there is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no comprehensive</font>

132
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,810
spreadsheet that would then be<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

133
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:42,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">date a few weeks later</font>

134
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:45,250
so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the solution that we came up</font>

135
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,989
for that is that we created a service

136
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,940
called the alert reporter so<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

137
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standalone</font>

138
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">python service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it produces a report</font>

139
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,820
weekly in a spreadsheet form<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

140
00:05:54,849 --> 00:06:00,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically aggregates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it collect it asks</font>

141
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">Plunkett asking lastly reacts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> XYZ</font>

142
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,360
alerting frameworks that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> give me</font>

143
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the details from the last week about</font>

144
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,419
the alerts that have fired<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

145
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,940
produces a report that allows us to have

146
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:14,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">gained valuable insights into which</font>

147
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,930
alerts<font color="#CCCCCC"> are possibly too noisy</font>

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,949
how many alerts do we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know that</font>

149
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,520
we have a hundred and seventy-three

150
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:24,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">alert somehow that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty awesome and</font>

151
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,620
it lets us kind of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a take</font>

152
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,240
a higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a step back and take a</font>

153
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">10,000 foot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> view at our alerts and see</font>

154
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,280
which ones are maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> firing too often</font>

155
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,930
which ones have<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many false positives</font>

156
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,849
and you know we can focus our attention

157
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,550
on which ones are important to us<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

158
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:40,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that visibility is super important and</font>

159
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you don't know how many alerts you</font>

160
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,479
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a defined</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys should do</font>

161
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,500
something like this

162
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:50,729
so the next yeah so here's an example of

163
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,729
what that report looks like

164
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:59,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">so actionability so this is this is the</font>

165
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:04,989
biggest problem that we had that that we

166
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:07,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">solved so first of all if you have</font>

167
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:09,039
alerts that are being sent over email

168
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:11,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're just not going to be actionable</font>

169
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,959
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't expect people to be monitoring</font>

170
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:16,659
their inbox all the time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

171
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,519
critical<font color="#E5E5E5"> alerts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

172
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:21,039
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you send these alerts to</font>

173
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,059
people's inboxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> people see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if a couple</font>

174
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,889
of them and then they're going to create

175
00:07:22,059 --> 00:07:27,489
filters and they're never<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see them</font>

176
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:29,259
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know that that happens and</font>

177
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:32,859
there's no ownership with emails so

178
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:34,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">ticketing systems are better but so you</font>

179
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,800
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least a sign and owner to a</font>

180
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:37,689
ticket<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda cool but there's</font>

181
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,309
still no enforcement that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything is</font>

182
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:41,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get done with that ticket</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

183
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:44,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">could just get you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lost on some</font>

184
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:46,359
jerk you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who knows if the person who</font>

185
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:48,339
that ticket is<font color="#CCCCCC"> assigned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to is actually</font>

186
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,619
going to do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

187
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:52,539
have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security team has to go</font>

188
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:55,059
and look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> q and follow up with</font>

189
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,739
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't want to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

190
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:59,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about email so here's an example</font>

191
00:07:56,739 --> 00:08:03,609
of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in the day when we used to do</font>

192
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:05,229
alerts / email<font color="#CCCCCC"> so here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alerts</font>

193
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">that fire when people are making changes</font>

194
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:08,558
to our AWS infrastructure without

195
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:13,089
following proper change control

196
00:08:08,559 --> 00:08:15,699
procedures<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as you can see we have</font>

197
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:17,559
about 15 emails or so and all of those

198
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,899
emails are coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> are alerting</font>

199
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:21,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">framework and and only one of the cases</font>

200
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:25,239
do we have a real human actually

201
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:26,379
responding to the alert<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font>

202
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:28,299
interesting what about all those other

203
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,169
cases so let's look at some of these

204
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,259
emails

205
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:35,049
here's the email from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yiannis</font>

206
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:37,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jana says hey this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was me creating the</font>

207
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">RDS instances for some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help desk ticket</font>

208
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if we look at the email that he</font>

209
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:43,299
responded to

210
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:46,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">here's an event that's in there and we</font>

211
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:48,008
see the others the event<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's the</font>

212
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,389
honest creating a<font color="#CCCCCC"> role called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RDS</font>

213
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:51,699
monitoring role that seems to

214
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:53,019
corroborate his story<font color="#CCCCCC"> now let's look at</font>

215
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:55,089
some of the other events<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some of</font>

216
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:55,720
those other<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails that nobody replied</font>

217
00:08:55,089 --> 00:09:00,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font>

218
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:03,310
so here's an example where a user<font color="#CCCCCC"> named</font>

219
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">matt is adding the user jason door</font>

220
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the admins group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so when somebody had</font>

221
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,660
somebody to the admins group<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

222
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,660
know about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case nobody</font>

223
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">acknowledge it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was this something</font>

224
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:19,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh is this something normal is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this some</font>

225
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,029
malicious insiders<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some malware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

226
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:24,279
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> because nobody acknowledge it</font>

227
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I probably wouldn't have scoured my</font>

228
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">emails</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for these events if I</font>

229
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,390
wasn't giving this presentation so you

230
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,970
know these things get lost in<font color="#E5E5E5"> email so</font>

231
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">here's another example here the user</font>

232
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">Martin has somehow removed himself from</font>

233
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:42,370
the users group<font color="#CCCCCC"> require two fa require</font>

234
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,020
require<font color="#CCCCCC"> mfa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mfa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stands for</font>

235
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,850
multi-factor authentication obviously

236
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,260
this is obviously a problem if someone

237
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,470
can remove themselves from the group

238
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,790
that mandates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fa sol somebody does</font>

239
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,440
this I want to see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpdesk ticket</font>

240
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">or some kind of ticket some kind of</font>

241
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,339
background context on why they did this

242
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:01,420
and I don't want to go you know

243
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:03,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">unacknowledged here's another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

244
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">here's another case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another event</font>

245
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,960
from one of those other emails<font color="#CCCCCC"> so here</font>

246
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,480
the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> l</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Matthew has changed the</font>

248
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,740
and it looks like he's allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

249
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,140
any machine in the whole world to

connect to any port on any ec2 instance

253
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:25,030
something malicious or possibly a

256
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,000

257
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,080
the change maybe with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

258
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,670
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really want to talk to</font>

259
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">Matthew about this and why he did that</font>

260
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:40,030
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's email</font>

261
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,280
let's not do that so here's an example

262
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:45,130
of some<font color="#E5E5E5"> juror tickets sold your tickets</font>

263
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,150
are better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're like me and</font>

264
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,850
you're really good with your ticket

265
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:52,000
hygiene<font color="#E5E5E5"> you follow you you monitor the</font>

266
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:54,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">queue and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when something comes in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,770
gets assigned<font color="#CCCCCC"> each ticket comes in and</font>

268
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,260
you basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledge it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

269
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">close the ticket but not everyone else</font>

270
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:04,930
is good with their ticket hygiene as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

271
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:07,779
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's a case of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yiannis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on my</font>

273
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:11,110

277
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:21,279
in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ticket was created</font>

282
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:31,959
another day goes by<font color="#CCCCCC"> no acknowledgement I</font>

283
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,339
say hey honest being<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you there</font>

284
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:37,839
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledgement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I say another</font>

285

288
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,260
being kind of effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

289
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,310
really want to do that like I've got

290
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,720
better things to do than sit there

291
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,109
monitoring the<font color="#CCCCCC"> queue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paying people</font>

292
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">in jira</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what do we do to solve some</font>

293
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,880
of these problems

294
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:00,610
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's the solution for fixing</font>

295
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-action ability so first of all</font>

296
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,089
just don't use<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails for alerts just</font>

297
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,200
just forget about it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess you</font>

298
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:07,209
can still send them and send them to

299
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,110
some alias for like you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

300
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,670
bored one day and you want to

301
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,250
historically go and look at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> alerts</font>

302
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,649
fired<font color="#E5E5E5"> but don't expect any action to</font>

303
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,790
happen as a result of the of the emails

304
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,449
that have been sent

305
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:21,969
so for jira<font color="#E5E5E5"> soldier has a pretty cool</font>

306
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:24,219
feature called service desk<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we've</font>

307
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:27,579
enabled the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Service Desk feature on our</font>

309
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:34,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">alerts project and what that enables us</font>

310
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,339
to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup s la's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Q's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can</font>

311
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,110
define that<font color="#E5E5E5"> p0 tickets priority 0</font>

312
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,420
tickets need to be turned around or

313
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">acknowledge within one hour we can say</font>

314
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,740
we can set different<font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> la's four</font>

315
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,390
different priorities and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's open-ended</font>

316
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,519
you can make that you can make basically

317
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:51,130
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign of prior</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an SLA with any</font>

319
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:58,390
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jira cues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually really</font>

320
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,920
cool too<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you don't get this by</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">desk project you can set create these</font>

323
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,970
different cues so you can see at a quick

324
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,930
glance<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution of the</font>

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:17,620
project so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned SLA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you see</font>

327
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,680
up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some examples of what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SLA is give you so you'd be</font>

329
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,349
surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> how effective it is</font>

330
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,089
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> colored icon and a</font>

00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:29,899
really effective to get people to like

<font color="#E5E5E5">want to take action and resolve that</font>

ticket before it turns yellow or red or

335
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:40,128
<font color="#CCCCCC">negative it's super effective psychology</font>

336
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:44,089
is awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> so but that's not the full</font>

337
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:45,410
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> so because again people might not</font>

338
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,089
be looking at those tickets and then i

339
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,499
have to get involved in and refresh the

340
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:51,079
jerk you all the time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

341
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:54,019
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we built a service called</font>

342
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,790
the actionable<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning service now the</font>

344
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">enforces action on tickets and it does</font>

345
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,850
this by doing two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> it finds</font>

346
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,069
tickets that are unassigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

347
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,959
attempts to find an assignee for that

348
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:07,519
ticket and it does that using a variety

349
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,670
of heuristics that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

350
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,470
just a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when it finds tickets</font>

351
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,290

354
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:21,469
various different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways and the way that</font>

355
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:22,790
it does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just it's a stateless</font>

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,920
behalf<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in that case the ticket would</font>

393
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,330
get assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the person and they</font>

394
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,189
would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey and I didn't do this I</font>

395
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,960
didn't create this new user and then we

396
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,370
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> get you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then at that</font>

397
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,710
point the security team would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

398
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved and we would begin our incident</font>

399
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:03,920
response

400
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:06,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so so it's kind of on the honor</font>

401
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:10,099
system so on the internal bad actor

402
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenario you might think well hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

403
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,310
you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm an internal matter i'm</font>

404
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,500
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna acknowledge that ticket</font>

405
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,989
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have as part of our own point</font>

406
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">this process that we go back and audit</font>

407
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,980
all of those acknowledgments<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

408
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,330
retro actively and we make sure that

409
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,690
there's no funny business

410
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,880
so here's an example of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> self service</font>

411
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,200
alert<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a jira ticket and in the</font>

412
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jura ticket there's a little piece of</font>

413
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,550
metadata that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're to extract the</font>

414
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,739
actor<font color="#CCCCCC"> named from that event and as you</font>

415
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:40,910
can see here from the event<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a</font>

416
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,010
duo integration<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so in this case</font>

417
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,319
you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> duo data dot user name is</font>

418
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:47,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alec</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the actionable alerting service</font>

419
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,339
goes and looks up Alec<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Active</font>

420
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Directory assign the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ticket</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to him and</font>

421
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:55,640
give him a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jira so</font>

422
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,920
sometimes the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actor is not</font>

423
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,420
actually a real human sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

424
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">are service accounts that make these</font>

425
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,000
changes and this is common when when the

426
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">court bench team has some shared scripts</font>

427
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,579
that or<font color="#E5E5E5"> web applications that make</font>

428
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:12,500
certain changes for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when that</font>

429
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:14,209
happens it's hard to find an owner<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

430
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,010
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just assign a ticket to the</font>

431
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">surface account</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the actionable</font>

432
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,400
learning service in that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll look</font>

433
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">up the user it will determine that it's</font>

434
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,819
not a real user and it's a service

435
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,800
account and it knows how to track down

436
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,510
the owning team that owns that service

437
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,879
account and it will go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them in</font>

438
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:32,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">jira are sorry it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring them in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> JIRA</font>

439
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,920
and IRC<font color="#CCCCCC"> and or slack or whatever chat</font>

440
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,400
mechanism that they have and say hey

441
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">group that owns this service account</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

442
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,710
of you guys need to please acknowledge

443
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:45,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">this because this thing have</font>

444
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> self-service alerts</font>

445
00:17:45,529 --> 00:17:48,350
and that's one way that the actual

446
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,820
learning services signs ownership

447
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">another way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can assign ownership</font>

448
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,908
is by referencing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pagerduty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> schedule</font>

449
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,250
name in the ticket<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so this is super</font>

450
00:17:55,909 --> 00:18:00,080
effective to get you know get the person

451
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">who is currently on point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

452
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,059
looking at the ticket<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of having</font>

453
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,880
to go to email or something like that or

454
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:09,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">or sit on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a signed in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> queue so</font>

455
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,270
here's an example of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ticket has</font>

456
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">some metadata in there that says the</font>

457
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,929
pagerduty<font color="#CCCCCC"> schedule name this is an alert</font>

458
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,158
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> google suspicious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> login</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

459
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:17,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">something pretty sensitive we want the</font>

460
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:20,899
current on point person to look at it

461
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,789
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here the actual learning</font>

462
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:25,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">service looks at the malware on point</font>

463
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:27,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">schedule even pagerduty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finds that the</font>

464
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,020
current<font color="#CCCCCC"> assignment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that schedule is</font>

465
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">megan and it assigns the ticket to her</font>

466
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:36,649
so if it's not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> self service alert and</font>

467
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:40,010
if we think it's not as important enough

468
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:42,500
to justify getting the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> on point</font>

469
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:45,230
assigned to it then<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last ditch</font>

470
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">effort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is to assign the ticket to the</font>

471
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:49,100
owner of the alert so the owner of the

472
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,750
alert is going to have the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> context</font>

473
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,899
on what that alert means and how to deal

474
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:56,630
with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that person can be held</font>

475
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:59,899
responsible for either<font color="#E5E5E5"> following up with</font>

476
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,820
someone or initiating incident response

477
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:06,229
or a technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and closing the ticket</font>

478
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:07,639
so now we figured out how to assign the

479
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,740
tickets<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people we have owners but</font>

480
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,289
what happens when those owners are lazy

481
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,510
and don't respond to their tickets<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in</font>

482
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:16,399
the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to go and monitor the</font>

483
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">queue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say hey you know the</font>

484
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:20,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">technologists ticket technologist taking</font>

485
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see your manager so now we</font>

486
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,039
have a computer to do all that for us so

487
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:27,289
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping the user in IRC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it can ping</font>

488
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the user in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jira</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can ping the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> users</font>

489
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:31,250
manager in<font color="#CCCCCC"> JIRA and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd be surprised</font>

490
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,840
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surprised how</font>

491
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,360
effective it is when you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone's</font>

492
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,639
manager in communications it really it

493
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,959
really gets action to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> so here's</font>

494
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,720
an example of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a jira ticket</font>

495
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,120
that's past due and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few days goes by</font>

496
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">it doesn't get acknowledged so then you</font>

497
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,120
can see on the second comment they are

498
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,520
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actionable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learning service kicks in</font>

499
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,639
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

500
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,410
hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh jose this ticket is past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SLA for</font>

501
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,600
resolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please take a</font>

502
00:19:52,410 --> 00:20:00,020
look at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can see if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

503
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,020
moments later the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tickets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledged</font>

504
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,439
so here's the example<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar to when I</font>

505
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to go in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before in CC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people's</font>

506
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,420
managers<font color="#CCCCCC"> here the actionable learning</font>

507
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,550
service notices that a ticket<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> passed</font>

508
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">to it first try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spinning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jira if that</font>

509
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:16,350
doesn't work after another<font color="#E5E5E5"> configurable</font>

510
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,260
amount of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes and escalates by</font>

511
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:21,719
adding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> managers this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person's</font>

512
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,590
manager to the ticket<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you can see</font>

513
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,590
there it's super effective

514
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,080
so another problem that we have is that

515
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,080
there was no standardization with our

516
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,659
alerts<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know how this is there's</font>

517
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,220
no RFC for<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alert</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so one person</font>

518
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,700
thinks that everything is really

519
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,440

another person thinks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

521
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,570

522
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,280
tomorrow and when there's no like when

523
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,720
there's no standards if you leave this

<font color="#E5E5E5">to people's opinions and then you have</font>

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,260
your alerts that are in various

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,270
different states and<font color="#E5E5E5"> its really kind of</font>

527
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,270
hard to keep track of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's hard</font>

528
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:03,150
when an alert comes in if you should

529
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:04,260
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like believe the priority or not</font>

530
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:08,250
because at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to depend</font>

531
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:10,740
on who the author was so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did we do</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do to fix that so we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">much never appropriate to email it talks</font>

540
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,450
about what kind of mandatory fields we

00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">required</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to set at a minimum you should</font>

542
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,930
set the owner on the alert so that the

<font color="#E5E5E5">actual learning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> service can do its job</font>

544
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:39,180
and it talks about the various feature

545
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:43,169
sets we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when it makes sense to</font>

546
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:45,870
make us<font color="#E5E5E5"> an alert self-service</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:53,340

550
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:56,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe you shouldn't have a p0 alert that</font>

551
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,949
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey security group changed you know</font>

552
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:02,970
maybe it makes more sense to have

553
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">a higher priority alert for when the</font>

554
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:08,490
scope of access has been increased on a

555
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,780
security group and maybe when the scope

556
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,220
of access has been decreased on a

557
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,780
security group<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that's less</font>

558
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,590
important and that can be you know

559
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">treated as a lower priority thing to</font>

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow up on</font>

561
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:24,750
so finally finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> it talks about</font>

562
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,220
testing and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant basically mandates</font>

563
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,820
that any new alert<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write needs to be</font>

564
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,980
tested<font color="#CCCCCC"> so speaking of testing we've</font>

565
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,860
we've found in the past that a lot of

566
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:38,280
our alerts were sitting there with bugs

567
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:40,560
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> latent bugs just such that the</font>

568
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,410
alerts didn't actually work<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

569
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,290
a typo in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> despot query</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where is</font>

570
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,790
clearing the wrong index name or maybe

571
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:49,470
there was an assumption about the data

572
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you assume some field was always</font>

573
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,990
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> present but in the</font>

574
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,790
particular scenario that you're trying

575
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:58,920
to catch that field is actually not

576
00:22:53,790 --> 00:23:01,200
present<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem and another</font>

577
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,860
problem is that sometimes the data

578
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,020
sources have problems or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

579
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,790
upstream of your learning framework so

580
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,680
sometimes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> datasource just drops off</font>

581
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,050
the map for some reason either to a full

582
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">flat line or like a dramatic drop in</font>

583
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:17,879
volume like you know when you upgraded

584
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux kernel on all your hosts and</font>

585
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,230
suddenly after that day no more logs

586
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,550
came in and you didn't find out for like

587
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,980
two months until you're investigating

588
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:28,470
something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a huge problem</font>

589
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,060
so what do you do to solve that problem

590
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,890
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of touching upon this</font>

591
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,600
earlier but for all of the new alerts

592
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,180
you right you need to test them<font color="#CCCCCC"> into n</font>

593
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't you can't call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and alert done</font>

594
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,530
until you've actually seen it fire for

595
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,640
the thing that you're trying to catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

596
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,560
if you're trying to catch somebody

597
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,870
making a reverse shell or doing

598
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:49,080
something sketchy or<font color="#CCCCCC"> XX filling data</font>

599
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:50,909
once you deploy that alert<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exhale</font>

600
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">that data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> river shell and</font>

601
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,790
wait five minutes and wait to get that

602
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,040
alert<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't get that alert</font>

603
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you want to find</font>

604
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,430
it then instead of realizing six months

605
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,340
down the line that the alert doesn't

606
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:05,010
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely create flatline alerts</font>

607
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">so make sure you have alerts that that</font>

608
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,750
fire when the data disappears over some

609
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,150
amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some range of time and not</font>

610
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,360
only complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> flatlines but volume drops</font>

611
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font>

612
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,600
well and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those flat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> landlords</font>

613
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:20,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the last thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll talk about</font>

614
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,260
is false positive so obviously there's

615
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,510
always going to be false<font color="#E5E5E5"> positives is</font>

616
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:28,020
that it's really hard to prevent false

617
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:30,780
positives for example when your

618
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,700
antivirus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the mac laptop finds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

619
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows executable that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not</font>

620
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,760
that big of a deal that's a false

621
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,710
positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you deploy a new</font>

622
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,929
production server service and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

623
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,570
listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> on some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ports that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're never</font>

624
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:44,640
listening that were never being<font color="#E5E5E5"> listened</font>

625
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:46,230
on before an alert is probably gonna

626
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,270
fire for that and it's not really a big

627
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:51,450
deal and it's a false positive

628
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:55,620
so how do we rectify these false

629
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:57,270
positives the way we rectify that is

630
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,399
through automation so automate your

631
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident response steps make it such</font>

632
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,510
that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fault when an alert comes in</font>

633
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can make the call of whether or not</font>

634
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,799
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> false positive really quickly and</font>

635
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,480
so that you're not spending a whole

636
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,889
bunch of time chasing your tail trying

637
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,240
to figure out if this is a false alarm

638
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something real</font>

639
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,240
you definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to spend two days on</font>

640
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,189
something that ends up being<font color="#CCCCCC"> a false</font>

641
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">positive so write the scripts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

642
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,730
you're writing a script is going to

643
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,990
automate a whole bunch of steps and you

644
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,150
have that for when the alert comes in

645
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">consider pushing that upstream into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

646
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,049
learning framework so why have a human

647
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,820
being involved in hitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter on some</font>

648
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:35,129
script<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you can just plug that into</font>

649
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:37,918
your learning framework itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how do</font>

650
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,960
we measure success<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

651
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,669
hard for me to do because in the past we

652
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,110
didn't really have much visibility into

653
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:45,090
what was going on we just had a bunch of

654
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:48,870
emails that were not being acknowledged

655
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:50,070
