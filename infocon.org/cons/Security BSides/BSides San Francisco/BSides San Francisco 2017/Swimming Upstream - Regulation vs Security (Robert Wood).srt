<font color="#E5E5E5">age-old battle between regulation and</font>

compliance and security where most of us

20
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:46,640
likely fall and some of the challenges

21
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,559
that end up coming into those into that

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,630
battle when those things are at odds

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,910
with one another even though regulation

into being with the best of intentions

26
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:59,270
so things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mist and iso and all of</font>

27
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,339
these frameworks out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,239
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to share some some</font>

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:48,680
thing down here is I'm a massive<font color="#E5E5E5"> Batman</font>

tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably the latter so</font>

50
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:58,489
first things first I want to cover what

51
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,320
is the actual problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what are the</font>

52
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:03,170
what are some of the symptoms of this of

53
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,540
this bigger compliance<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs security issue</font>

54
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,358
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it boils down to three main</font>

55
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,760
things the first being that there are a

56
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:13,910
zillion frameworks out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

57
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,608
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all seen the xkcd around</font>

58
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,380
like making 11 framework to rule them

59
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:20,480
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just ended</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and ending up</font>

60
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">introducing another framework on top of</font>

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,590
you know and number of you just end up

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:26,239
with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> n plus one problem and so we're</font>

64

compliance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that comes from</font>

65
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,260
government regulations and customers and

66
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,659
maybe you know internal organizational

67
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,399
policy and it's just a lot of stuff to

manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> for already overburdened</font>

need you two to go through to jump

through this hoop for us and you know

117

many security teams will end up just

kind of rushing to the door to you know

<font color="#E5E5E5">and so you know why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why is that</font>

190
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:06,310
and then third<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

193
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,510
become so enamored<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's why I called</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the pokemons syndrome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone talking</font>

about go players in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so hands or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ladders and and do all sorts of</font>

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:36,159
so what this ends up looking like<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

203
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:40,720
people become so enamored<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking these</font>

about best practices they forget about

you know making sure that the controls

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:54,130
are implementing this guy doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:55,690
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry he comes foot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we end up</font>

210
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,460
forgetting about the things that are

211
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,280
right around us are making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">making sure that you know that the</font>

processes<font color="#E5E5E5"> were implementing are actually</font>

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,280
effective and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll do one more this is</font>

216
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">epic into what i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said what i end up with</font>

00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">ended up witnessing and so we end up in</font>

218
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">this situation where we don't really</font>

00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,140
care about are the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

220
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,340
implementing<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective and that's a big</font>

221
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,870
problem because if something is not

222
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,180
effective if it doesn't cover the entire

223
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,730
scope of what it should be covering<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

224
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just check your box and move on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

225
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,090
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to end up in a big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issue</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a big problem down the road and</font>

227
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:33,460
so this is an issue that that I've run

228
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,410
into a few different times is<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases like</font>

229
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,750
this where you end up with regulatory

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,189
policy over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and organizational</font>

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,890
read the text in here these are

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,310
notice in the organizational policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's kind of gnarliest it's not</font>

237
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,739
something that you would actually want

238
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,430
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they're basically saying</font>

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,360
we can effectively monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

243
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for anyone who</font>

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,720
guarding the assistance we know that

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,260
that's not that's not cool that's not

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,460
kosher<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that is something that an</font>

organization that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've worked with</font>

actually enforced upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system owners</font>

so we ended up with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up</font>

259
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,800
looking like is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> ended up shrinking</font>

260
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,170
down the scope or kind of dumbing down

all of these other controls that were

how little compliance actually ends up

start to build stories around the

so please<font color="#E5E5E5"> please address it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you</font>

634
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">feeds into that idea of monitoring and</font>

reporting on the state of your

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:24,780

637
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,210
to think about you know if we're

638
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,710
tracking all of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start to</font>

639
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,530
be able to generate metrics for them

640
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,510
which is great metrics are fantastic and

641
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,000
you know if you're running these things

642
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:38,190
on a case-by-case basis you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

643
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">point-in-time audits then it becomes</font>

644
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,760
very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you're not getting</font>

645
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,190
very timely metrics like doing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

quarterly assessment as an example

647
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:50,370
however if you're running a lot of your

control stuff through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cic pipeline and</font>

649
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,120
you can start to track these things how

653
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,060
that provides a much more compelling

increasing social pressure on people<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

whether it's social pressure on an

and want to track and that are important

to the key stakeholders<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you can</font>

697
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:34,379
start to tell really compelling stories

one another<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there are there</font>

705
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:53,730
are six main<font color="#E5E5E5"> big takeaways</font>

706
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:56,460
the first is making sure that we reframe

707
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,950
the narrative around around compliance

708
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,289
reframe the narrative around risk and

709
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,659
start to think more about how we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

710
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:05,279
we can report towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> people's intrinsic</font>

711
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:08,820
motivation so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

712
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,379
motivated by you know by again business

713
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:12,178
development or making sure that their

714
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,859
customers trust them when they walk into

715
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:16,619

718

720

know very very closely related to the

this matters because compliance enables

isn't necessarily bad but it can be it

it's like a necessary evil in the

804
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,139
well and extremely poorly in the sense

that some issues are just way too big<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">hard and fast rules that kind of blanket</font>

those things that that is

know we need to embrace automation much

like we are in the rest of the security

a subset<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sub function of this broader</font>

controls and compliance and all of that

849
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:43,029
is like right on top of the business and

850
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything is aligned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly but very</font>

851
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:47,080
much like when you build a you know

kind of self maintains and then from a

875
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:38,289
you know from those controls that can't

877
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:43,239
we found really effective is identifying

the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> owners</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a mapping</font>

business owners to a particular

00:33:45,129 --> 00:33:50,498
capability and so let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

business continuity<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the great</font>

00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:54,639
example so you know that may fall if we

883
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:58,149
think about business continuity from a

basically making sure that you know if

things go off the rails<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">going to be the ones on the hook and</font>

00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:19,509
then we just have you know like ongoing

894
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,760
conversations with those individuals and

895
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,710
we put the pressure back on them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

897
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,220
do things like like tabletop exercises

know talk to those those individuals who

are responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up a tabletop</font>

cross-functional thing and you know

we'll make it fun and engaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of that and you know we'll talk through</font>

how they would actually respond to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

912
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:02,080
scenario so you know like availability

916
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,250
what do you what do you actually do have

917
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,840
you have you thought about all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

918
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:13,750
things and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> their answers are not very</font>

919
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:16,030
good or compelling or if they just have

920
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:18,040
no idea what to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> then that shows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

921
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,900
they're not actually you know taking

922
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,000
this taking this thing seriously and

923
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:23,109
then we can start to you know we can

924
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,820
start to work with them to create

925
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:26,950
project plans<font color="#CCCCCC"> because ultimately if you</font>

926
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,960
make it real for them in the sense that

927
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,910
something that they're responsible for

928
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> completely fall over</font>

929
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:35,200
because they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintained this</font>

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">this responsibility then you know</font>

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> fools not you necessarily like HR</font>

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">is another really good example because</font>

there's so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> hr-related controls</font>

939
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:21,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the question was just a repeat</font>

940
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,739
was when there's a lot of different

941
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:26,440
platforms and tools and technologies in

942
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:30,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">a play how do you manage all of that</font>

943
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:32,019
under one roof is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so one</font>

944
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:34,269
thing that we've found that we found

945
00:36:32,019 --> 00:36:36,698
effective is we've got we've got a few

946
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:38,379
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> platforms so to speak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

947
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:41,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">the business lines that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maintaining</font>

948
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:43,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">so one way is to try to just you know</font>

949
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,799
push people to consolidate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

950
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:46,209
actually an easy thing to do and it's

951
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:49,900
probably not actually very likely to

952
00:36:46,209 --> 00:36:52,089
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but one thing we had to kind of</font>

953
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:55,690
adapt to and this introduces a little

954
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:58,058
bit of complexity<font color="#CCCCCC"> but is is capturing</font>

955
00:36:55,690 --> 00:37:00,219
somewhat of a scope<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you will perk</font>

956
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:03,819
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you know something as</font>

957
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:06,519
simple as something as simple as

958
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:10,119
encryption at rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of of data sources</font>

959
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:12,160
and you would we extrapolate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to</font>

960
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,289
a particular product and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> owning</font>

961
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,558
team and so we have each of our controls

962
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:18,999
map to somebody who somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a team</font>

00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:21,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">who's going to own it and the product</font>

964
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:23,109
that it relates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's kind of</font>

965
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,630
an additional an additional mapping and

966
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:28,538
so a lot of controls if you go through

967
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:31,180
these these frameworks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> stock to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iso</font>

use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ordinal risk scale to talk</font>

about numbers when it comes to risk like

<font color="#CCCCCC">that's good question so the the</font>

1053
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:39,260
particular question was how do you deal

1054

with with issues that<font color="#CCCCCC"> lets say something</font>

1055
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:45,920
goes down and that that thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down</font>

1056
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,839
does not itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce a business</font>

1057
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,550
risk in terms of financial loss or

1058
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,700
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that effect versus</font>

1059
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:54,560
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know is directly</font>

1060
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,060
impacting the business like you know the

1061
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,680
the sequel injection or something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">heard that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data loss of some</font>

1063

sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in that case I probably that's</font>

1064
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually really good question</font>

you could probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them together</font>

1066
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,880
in the sense that you know if this thing

00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,140
happens you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

1068
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,930
probably marry the two things together

00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,879
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like look at them as 11</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> joint</font>

much more likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fly blind and if</font>

1073
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:27,649
you don't see if you don't see a risk

1074
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,840
then or you know somebody poking around

1075
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:31,730
your network then you know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in for trouble in some way shape or form</font>

1077
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:37,520
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i probably just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> liver</font>

1078
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">right that risk out as one thing such as</font>

1079
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,710
you're not able to see you know somebody

1080

impacted and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say is you know</font>

1085
