1
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:16,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">so to get a more complete sense of what</font>

2
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:18,099
it looks like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> info SEC teams are</font>

3
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:21,070
interacting with the rest of the company

4
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:23,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to as many people as I could</font>

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,930
at different sized companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,988
industries<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their experiences</font>

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:31,719
working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> infosec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what went well and</font>

8
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:33,700
what didn't go well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't need</font>

9
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:35,500
to read all of these miserable quotes

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try to tell the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as much</font>

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a high level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,510
there are two areas that we need to

13
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:46,000
focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those are the two areas i'm</font>

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to split this talk into today</font>

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
so first we need to increase visibility

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that people know where to find</font>

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,820
us and do our best to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

18
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,370
working alongside the rest of the

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,920
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of just getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> loop</font>

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">then once something is on fire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,590
secondly we need to communicate

22
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:09,100
effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i can make myself and my</font>

23
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:11,740
team super visible by sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 mass</font>

24
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,919
emails a day<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would not call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

25
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,389
effective communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the second</font>

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,429
half of this presentation we're going to

27
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:20,920
go over strategies to just make sure our

28
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:22,780
communications are impactful<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">really having their desired effect</font>

30
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:30,850
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this visibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piece so</font>

31
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:32,709
perhaps unsurprisingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the</font>

32
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,439
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to you did not know</font>

33
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:38,079
anything about their<font color="#CCCCCC"> company's info SEC</font>

34
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,839
teams and a lot of them didn't know what

35
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">infosec was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at all and most of those</font>

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,249
people were my close friends who don't

37
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:47,979
know what my job is such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine one</font>

38
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:51,670
individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked to works at a hedge</font>

39
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:53,679

41
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:58,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">his security team is non-existent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

42
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:59,469
was like alarming and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay</font>

43
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:02,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go hack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hedge fund</font>

44
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:04,509
obviously but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I did a hell of a</font>

45
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,599
linkedin<font color="#E5E5E5"> search and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I saw that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

46
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:09,818
actually have a really sizable security

47
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,900
team that is in the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> office as him</font>

48
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:17,260
which is alarming<font color="#E5E5E5"> on many levels</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,390
there's a lot of reasons why<font color="#CCCCCC"> fixing this</font>

50
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,429
problem is important visibility matter

51
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">his first of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all if people don't know</font>

52
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,330
where to find us they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

53
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,069
reach out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us with questions and</font>

54
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,170
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna let us know when</font>

55
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:30,970
something sketchy is happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

56
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,989
obviously not ideal<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an incident</font>

57
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">detection perspective also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe less</font>

58
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:40,660
obviously being<font color="#E5E5E5"> visible is important</font>

59
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,450
when we are competing with other

60
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,489
business units for resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

61
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,920
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say is this presentation might</font>

62
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:51,670
help you get that cash money

63
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,179
so what can we do to fix that problem

64
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:59,619
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase visibility we can start by</font>

65
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:06,400
hanging out with people in real life

66
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:07,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their dough right well we got</font>

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">into how to do this on the interwebs</font>

68
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:16,510
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> but so so forming trusted</font>

69
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:19,450
relationships<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would argue is part of a</font>

70
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,910
healthy<font color="#E5E5E5"> security program</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

71
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,339
people i<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to think of us as</font>

72
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,160
gatekeepers that they're scared of

73
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,140
getting in trouble with<font color="#CCCCCC"> so our goal</font>

74
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,810
might just be too<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily</font>

75
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,298
need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> bffs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we can just get them</font>

76
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,829
to think of us as an acquaintance that

77
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:36,820
they're comfortable shooting a quick

78
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,630
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

79
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would argue that there</font>

80
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,190
is actually a business case for

81
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:48,250
attending the company happy hour or you

82
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,870
could maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> host your own happy hour or</font>

83
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,030
another event with your department just

84
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,390
as a reason to get in front of people

85
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:58,810
another suggestion i got from

86
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:01,600
interviewees<font color="#E5E5E5"> was to crash other teams</font>

87
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,299
meeting so this guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> his team has a</font>

88
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,170
status update meeting every monday<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously you can't do this with every</font>

team in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization but if there's</font>

96
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:20,168
one team in particular that you want to

97
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,060
partner with more closely<font color="#CCCCCC"> this might be</font>

a good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he said that it was</font>

99
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,919
really helpful and they offered a lot of

100
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:28,719

that they are responsible for a high

that might overwhelm your team<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting</font>

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">than I could hope</font>

267
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,190
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> post my first lunch and learn about</font>

268
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,560
that whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

269
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be visible just for the sake of being</font>

270
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,109
visible if we can get another goal in

271
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,790
there too<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just speculation</font>

272
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">is today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feels good</font>

273
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:28,520
so another<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next up and planning is</font>

274
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to be practice we're going to</font>

275
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,410
start with a small pilot group<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

276
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start with one</font>

277
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,010
department or one group of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

278
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,589
I roll out lunch and learns to the whole

279
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,330
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we're gonna document</font>

280
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure we're writing down everything</font>

281
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,870
that worked everything that didn't work

282
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information we need to do it</font>

283
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,940
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do better the next time and</font>

284
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,040
then we measure<font color="#CCCCCC"> so think about whether</font>

285
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:55,010
you accomplish the goals you set out to

286
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,020
the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> get feedback</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so in this</font>

287
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:59,000
case I'm going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> surveyed everyone</font>

288
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,860
who attended the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> should learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

289
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,410
how they felt about it and then we use

290
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,240
all that documentation to update our

291
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,569
plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we do it again and again</font>

292
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,630
forever<font color="#E5E5E5"> forever</font>

293
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:13,580
ok so we increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> our visibility and now</font>

294
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,000
everyone knows who we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> where to find</font>

295
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,800
us

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,880
we have so many new opportunities to

297
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,969
interact with the rest of the

298
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,250
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> but none of that matters if</font>

299
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:26,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're bad at communicating effectively</font>

300
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:29,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">so based on those conversations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

301
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,550
with people<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sort of broke it down into</font>

302
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,069
three issues that kept coming up again

303
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:37,010
and again and it sounds like we need our

304
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:40,070
communications to be intentional and

305
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:42,319
thorough<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and prompt and blame</font>

306
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:46,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">fraid so let's dive into each of those</font>

307
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,010
three intentional and thorough so here

308
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,060
is a checklist<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> walk there to make</font>

309
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:52,280
sure we're being intentional and

310
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">thorough this section could also be</font>

311
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,120
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took a lynda.com course on</font>

312
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,430
organizational communication and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

313
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,100
got were these six bullet points but

314
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,890
they're like<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine bullet points ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

315
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,750
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to think of an example of an</font>

316
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,390
actual communication you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

317
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to send out in your organization project</font>

318
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:11,819
you're working on that is going to

319
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,290
require

320
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another department</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or the rest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

321
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,849
the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that you can keep that in</font>

322
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,350
mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run through the list</font>

323
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,860
using an example from someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

324
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:26,100
interviewed<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a law associate who</font>

325
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:30,240
is super peeved about a new policy that

326
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:33,090
requires him to request access to client

327
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,070
files from is sometimes it takes

328
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">three-plus hours for him to get that</font>

329
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,110
access and the access expires after a

330
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,670
certain amount of time so this is

331
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,530
something he has to do again and again

332
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,729
every day makes it much harder for him

333
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,740
to do his job

334
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,740
so let's imagine we are the is team

335
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,200
rolling out this new policy

336
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,960
here's what we need to consider one who

337
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,520
is the receiver<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this message so we</font>

338
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,350
probably only want to send out this

339
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,550
communication to people who need to be

340
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,040
involved

341
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,020
first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's good security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hygiene</font>

342
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,959
a lot of times to send this information

343
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:09,240
out on a need-to-know basis<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also</font>

344
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,700
when people get messages from us over

345
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,860
and over that don't apply to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

346
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,760
become white noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they start</font>

347
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,270
ignoring us

348
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:21,330
we also want to consider this receivers

349
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:24,390
goals and priorities so this kid<font color="#E5E5E5"> cares</font>

350
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,130
about doing good work for his clients as

351
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,540
efficiently as possible because he would

352
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,000
like to sleep more than four hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

353
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">night</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we have to consider his</font>

354
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,030
priorities<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> setting up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">message to who would be the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thunder</font>

356
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,360
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Center</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should be influential to</font>

357
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,790
the receiver

358
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,580
let's say that hypothetically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a</font>

359
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">total joke and the open rate of an email</font>

360
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,500
for me would be under<font color="#CCCCCC"> three percent</font>

361
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:51,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">again completely hypothetically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I might</font>

362
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">need this message to come from someone</font>

363
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:58,050
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my boss 3 what is the focus</font>

364
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,180
of this message<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about this will</font>

365
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,770
help you keep it<font color="#E5E5E5"> succinct into the point</font>

366
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,410
if the receiver needs to take any action

367
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:08,280
that should be extremely obvious to them

368
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:10,800
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> how will it be interpreted the way</font>

369
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,800
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> interview interpreted the message</font>

370
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">is big takeaway was that the is team did</font>

371
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,040
not understand how the business operated

372
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:22,069
at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an ideal take away</font>

373
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we took the time to explain how this</font>

374
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,380
process would limit the ability of an

375
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,019
attacker with compromised credentials to

376
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,180
access sensitive data<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be a</font>

377
00:15:30,019 --> 00:15:34,430
little less frustrated and he might be

378
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:37,459
less likely to try to find a way to

379
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,500
circumvent this policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

380
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,849
worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> an extra paragraph in there to</font>

381
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,870
explain why it's happening

382
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">also I mean the process does seem pretty</font>

383
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,870
brutal

384
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:50,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have a hunch about what happened here</font>

385
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:53,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are a lot of new requirements in</font>

386
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:57,110
the legal industry and also in every

387
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,540
industry and sometimes when a new threat

388
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,509
or requirement pops up<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to come</font>

389
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,209
up with a quick way to address it

390
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:07,699
sometimes a temporary<font color="#E5E5E5"> sloppy solution</font>

391
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:10,219
until we can implement something that's

392
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:12,139
more permanent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's okay to</font>

393
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,990
communicate about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

394
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,819
to let people know that this is

395
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,199
temporary and there is something better

396
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:22,009
on the horizon

397
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:24,949
if that is the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 is feedback</font>

398
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:26,779
necessary and if feedback is necessary

399
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:30,410
have you explained how they can offer

400
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:32,750
that feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was very surprised that</font>

401
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,730
the lawyer<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to had not</font>

430
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,580
intentional and thorough<font color="#CCCCCC"> now let's talk</font>

431
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,770
about being consistent and prompt<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">can fix that</font>

437
00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:05,409
so let's talk about staying on message

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:07,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">flying members of your team out other</font>

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,570
three things three big<font color="#E5E5E5"> takeaways you</font>

447
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:30,490
want everyone in your organization to

448
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,678
know about how they can help protect the

449
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,090
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> it might make sense to really</font>

450
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,039
document those and just make sure

451
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,330
everyone on your team is<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-versed in</font>

452
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,570
those talking points

453
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:43,389
secondly<font color="#E5E5E5"> templates and documentation for</font>

454
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,850
all the things you probably already have

00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,520
a template for<font color="#E5E5E5"> company-wide security</font>

00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,450
those together<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone who gets the</font>

458
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,190
email knows what they're looking at as

459
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,070
soon as they get it that consistent

460
00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:00,190
format<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think even more importantly</font>

461
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:03,939
having a template for security alerts or

462
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:06,190
really any company communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> forces</font>

463
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,280
the person who's filling it out to

464
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,840
really think through all the parts that

465
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,899
need to be included you can use that

466
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,860
list on the last slide and just making

467
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,960
sure that they're not forgetting

468
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,820
everything you might be super

469
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,490
comfortable with everything that should

470
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,110
be included in an alert like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as</font>

471
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,630
your team scales and that become someone

472
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,789
else's responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to force</font>

473
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,760
them to include all the right

474
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:31,760
information

475
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">and when you are answering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone's</font>

476
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,410
question that answer should live

477
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:38,899
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> so start building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out an FAQ</font>

478
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">as early as possible</font>

479
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,150
it's a lot easier to do that as you go

480
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">then it is when you're adding more</font>

481
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the team and have to document</font>

482
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,480
stuff for them<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll probably start</font>

483
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,580
with a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> faq</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it would be great</font>

484
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,830
if down the road you could also create a

485
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,860
public<font color="#E5E5E5"> faq that's available to other</font>

486
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:59,449
people in the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font>

487
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,280
there are ways to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're being</font>

488
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,100
consistent and prompt through automation

489
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">anytime we're doing something over and</font>

490
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,110
over we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for a way to automate it</font>

491
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:12,409
this helps me so much because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

492
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:14,810
have to constantly remind people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

493
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,510
their access reviews or<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their</font>

494
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:19,070
security awareness training a computer

495
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:22,250
does that for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

496
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:24,110
so in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to saving time well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

497
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,330
so it helps us be consistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> and prompts</font>

498
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,969
you know they get those emails up the

499
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,560
right time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we write a great email once</font>

500
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,550
in the same one that goes out over and

501
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,530
over

502
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:36,080
it also saves me time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes me</font>

503
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,520
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> less of a jerk because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i am</font>

504
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,120
not the one emailing them over and over

and they might want to delete that post

523
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:35,000
of course as we have touched on already

524
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,730
automation is a slippery slope

525
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,750
no one knows about<font color="#E5E5E5"> alert fatigue better</font>

than<font color="#E5E5E5"> systemic ones</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use</font>

541
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,570
an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at the two different</font>

542
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:28,290
ways that we could handle this problem

543
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:30,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">lets a user clicks a link that he's not</font>

544
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:34,920
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> poop</font>

545
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:37,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">womp womp so a blame focus infotech team</font>

546
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,970
could maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> chalk that up to a bad apple</font>

547
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say well that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> users fault he's</font>

548
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,110
silly<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not good maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they get</font>

549
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,060
sassy with the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> they close out that</font>

550
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:52,110
ticket and never<font color="#E5E5E5"> look back</font>

551
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:55,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we just we created two problems here</font>

552
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:57,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">one that user had a bad experience with</font>

553
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,550
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're less likely to report an</font>

554
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,310
incident next time it happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font>

555
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:04,740
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> and two we didn't force ourselves</font>

556
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:08,220
to explore why this problem really

557
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:11,100
happened and we missed an opportunity to

558
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,080
fix a systemic problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font>

559
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,709
to do instead of looking for a person to

560
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:20,010
blame is zoom out and think about how

561
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:23,610
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> slipped through the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cracks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanna</font>

562
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:25,680
team up with that user and consider what

563
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,810
we could do differently moving forward

564
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,300
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to do more and user</font>

565
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:34,379
awareness training<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

566
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:36,090
change my email filters<font color="#E5E5E5"> in general we</font>

567
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,620
don't want to just assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> in every</font>

568
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,409
situation that someone is good and

569
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,879
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to approach these</font>

570
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,630
incidents with a new mindset that

571
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,930
something bad happened to us and we want

572
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,900
to fix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving</font>

573
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:52,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really the same reason we don't</font>

574
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:57,580
include names in a root cause analysis

575
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:06,430
the bottom line<font color="#E5E5E5"> is don't get blame get</font>

576
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:09,370
solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> catch-ups I was gonna stand</font>

577
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:11,200
like that until someone made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sound so</font>

578
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:13,389
I don't expect every strategy outlined

579
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,610
in this presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for everyone</font>

580
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:18,130
hopefully you just get one or two tips

581
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,870
that will work<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your organization</font>

582
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,090
I definitely learned a lot having these

583
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:24,070
conversations with people and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm really</font>

584
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:28,240
excited to put a lot of the things that

585
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:31,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">I learned into action at rapid7</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

586
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">we go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to say that if again</font>

587
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,200
