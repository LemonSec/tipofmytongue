came in one morning and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> open up the</font>

go through some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> check point</font>

and there's guards<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's walk around so</font>

99
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:26,719
what's the big deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lock</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> love to safe</font>

101
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,250
get into talking about this beauty level

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,960
security work in the real world

103
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think it's appropriate first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort</font>

104
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,979
of level set on what we're talking about

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,800
is what you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the OD level security</font>

00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,230
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not be what I think do the level</font>

107
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think a lot of people when</font>

they hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> DoD level security think it's</font>

the ultimate highest degree of security

a perception<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the answer is true</font>

113
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,130
in fact I<font color="#E5E5E5"> i I've experienced that with</font>

of security

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to suggest you today and</font>

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,740
what I hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> starter or</font>

119
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,169
something at least for us to think about

120
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,340
is a different way of thinking about

121
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:15,680
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> DoD level security this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

a quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> sampling but just in my time in</font>

133
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,679
of different activities a lot of

134
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,600
different disciplines<font color="#CCCCCC"> but one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

thing is new i'm talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> VOD level</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">securities in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the DoD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has been doing it</font>

139
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,960
for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you're going to see</font>

140
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,590
things that hopefully are familiar to

141
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,239
you

142
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm hoping that we talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them and</font>

143
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,170
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit different way like</font>

144
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,510
the basic risk equation<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

145
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,180
some form of her is aware of some form

146
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:08,180
of a risk equation where risk is some

147
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,520
sort of complicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithms</font>

148
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,750
simplified algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that something</font>

149
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,510
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all the vulnerabilities you</font>

150
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,160
have all the threats that you have and

151
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,289
you subtract off countermeasures and

152
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,240
that's what you're left with<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you know</font>

153
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,280
obviously a lot of the business is

154
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,480
reducing vulnerabilities are identifying

155
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">and detecting threats</font>

159
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,600
its most basic level<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

160
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,609

<font color="#E5E5E5">working together to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> produce risks and</font>

163
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:44,540
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was working on risk equations</font>

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:49,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than 20 years ago when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sword</font>

and I say vulnerabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> go around it</font>

168
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,020
see a booth where they're talking about

00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,300
vulnerabilities of threats or<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk</font>

170
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">threats risk in particular just go ask</font>

171
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">up and ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him what the definition is</font>

they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm guessing you'll get some interesting</font>

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,099
answers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guessing if you just go</font>

different people with the same booth

178
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,510
you may not get the same answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> I find</font>

179
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,190
that curious because there seems to be a

180
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,810
misunderstanding or a lack of

181
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:24,770
understanding of what these words mean

182
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the larger context I very often hear</font>

183
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,450
people sort of interchange the word risk

184
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,669
and threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in my way of thinking a</font>

185
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">threat is a component of risk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's part</font>

186
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,970
of the equation

187
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,640
it's not the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess it could</font>

188
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,560
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> if every other variable with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

189
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,870
let's not get too much into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> math</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

190
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,240
now but vulnerabilities its most basic

191
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,460
level it's a weakness<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

192
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,710
that could go wrong it's something that

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,440
is potentially bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's something that</font>

194
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,570
could potentially be exploited<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in</font>

195
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,820
my day threat was basically who it was

familiar with it

about that in a military context<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

220
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,990
lot different from what we think about

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,360
today in the internet world and how we

222
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,090
run our businesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and corporations but</font>

223
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,130
you know there's a basic concept here

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's all about the data security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

and taking a systematic approach to

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,320
protecting what it is that were trying

like well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not I'm the network guy</font>

407
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,970
in the company needs to have the big

picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they need to be involved and</font>

409
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:44,150
they need to know what's going on

410
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,800
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are probably familiar with</font>

411
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:48,980
the fact that in the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,810
data classification<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody got in</font>

413
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,820
trouble because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had an email server</font>

414
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,310
that had classified information on it

415
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">was never talked about and what was an</font>

416
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,150
important concept when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was within the</font>

417
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:03,050
DoD and i'm pretty sure it's still true

418
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:05,510
today is confidential information isn't

419
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,819
as important as top secret information

420
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,379
it doesn't necessarily require the same

421
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,230
degree of protection

422
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:16,310
it doesn't have to be required as long

423
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:18,770
as perhaps top-secret information<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

424
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:20,359
expires that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a life expectancy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

425
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:24,800
so there's a point where you don't need

426
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:27,829
to protect it<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

427
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,960

I start to think we need to have a

all the time and everything is broken

around everywhere and you know it seems

474
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,980
to me there's an argument for

very simple concept

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,680
whatever is most valuable to you you put

481
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:36,310
it on the inside and you have layers of

nowadays this life cycle can be hours

and minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> because our technology moves</font>

things that are problematic here though

604
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,760
is this begins<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and this is where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

605
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,230
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe step on toes a little bit</font>

606
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,580
this is very oriented<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards the</font>

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,330
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you remember</font>

you go back to what it is you're trying

little bit differently<font color="#CCCCCC"> i gotta move</font>

614
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,600
quickly because we're running out of

different<font color="#E5E5E5"> step and now my random parting</font>

618
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:48,370
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think what makes beauty level</font>

619
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:49,680
security hard to implement in in the

00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think our auto industry</font>

just tell me what I need to buy to fix

627

again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not you know technology is</font>

669
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,170
you've got to be expert on a thousand

best sales pitch very often wins

676
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,629
and that's probably not a good idea this

677
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:58,129
is a variation<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody put out again i</font>

683
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:11,719
point is simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow that's a lot to know</font>

684
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:14,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean there's a lot going on here</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think any of us can claim to be</font>

an expert on all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know a lot</font>

687
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:22,309
about a lot of that but there's a lot

688
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:25,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I don't know deeply about everybody</font>

689
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:26,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people processes and</font>

690
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:28,429
technology those are sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three</font>

691
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:32,329
components<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security in your</font>

00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:34,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization my final point is simply it</font>

693
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:35,269
starts with the purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you're</font>

694
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:36,859
doing know what you're trying to protect

696
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:41,239
I think we need to move beyond just

697
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:42,709
protect and secure everything because

698
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:44,509
it's all connected and it all has to be

699

treated equally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we need to be</font>
