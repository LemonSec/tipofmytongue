you know the next day I come into work

54
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,970
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I start focusing on things like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">high-availability her fault tolerance or</font>

56
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,620
let me go and look and learn how

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">auto-scaling groups</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we know that</font>

58
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,840
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked for these other features why</font>

59
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,279
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> i work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for security and that's</font>

60
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,710
what we decided to start thinking about

61
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,530
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put this up here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as like a true</font>

62
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,990
traditional security monitoring so we

63
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,960
build these rooms<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a bunch of blue</font>

64
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:41,710
lights and um like a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> maps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

65
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff and I'm not gonna lie they're</font>

66
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,120
pretty cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of a nerd</font>

67
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,560
dream<font color="#CCCCCC"> these rooms like I like the</font>

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">working here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just for like a few hours a</font>

69
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,130
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like I feel important medical</font>

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I really know who came up with</font>

71
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,180
these things

72
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who came up with the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stock</font>

73
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,550
with all these blue lights<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like to</font>

74
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,080
think maybe it's like some former

75
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,660
military commander that got into

76
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">security and said you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back back in</font>

77
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,400
the military we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technical</font>

78
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">operations rooms war rooms and it works</font>

79
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,140
there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> why can't work for security</font>

80
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work for the cyber you know</font>

81
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,789
let's solve the cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> by creating these</font>

82
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,349
rooms and hiring some of the best cyber

83
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,430
security engineers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> America</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and put</font>

84
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,370
them all in a room and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

85
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:32,680
fix this problem but it really doesn't

86
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:35,050
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just try to aggregate</font>

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">things from all over your organization</font>

88
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,040
information and put it all in one place

89
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,630
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then try to dissect and</font>

90

<font color="#E5E5E5">reverse-engineer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these systems</font>

91
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,070
work and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of feel bad for the</font>

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,719
people that work in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> rooms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,520
in that role as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tough</font>

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,080
it's really hard like your job in this

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,289
room gets harder and harder every single

97
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,390
day<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're taking in logs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

98
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">as it starts out as just a few thousand</font>

99
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">a day and then it gets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 200,000 today and</font>

100
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,640
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the millions and you're</font>

101
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,320
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> events from from all over the</font>

102
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,880
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> for systems you didn't design</font>

103
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">assistant you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand because</font>

104
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,080
you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> write back</font>

105
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you're tasked with finding anomalies</font>

106
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and how do you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's anomalous if</font>

107
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:19,840
you don't even know what the nominal

108
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,270
state of the system is so it's really

109
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,830
just doesn't work so how do we stop

110
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,320
complaining about this and then get some

111
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,419
solution so I like to think of there

112
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,520
being some walls between these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

113
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">parts of an organization so development</font>

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization and operations</font>

115
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,799
this is kind of what we talk about when

116
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,300
we talk about DevOps you know as a

117
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,610
community we said hey we don't like

118
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,050
there's a wall between<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's break</font>

119
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,840
that down and create what we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> dev</font>

120
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">ops teams then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started talking in the</font>

121
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,799
security community about development and

122
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,060
security engineering so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say</font>

123
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,280
security engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm talking about</font>

124
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,460
like baking<font color="#E5E5E5"> security into the system</font>

doing things like static analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> or or</font>

126
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,229
doing threat modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> so people will</font>

127
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,539
talk about things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> sex DevOps or</font>

128
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:05,740
whatever other fancy terms that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hate</font>

129
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,970
but that's what they tell their<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk and</font>

130
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,940
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know what we've done a</font>

131
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,230
good amount of work in that area<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

132
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,540
getting developers to think more about

133
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,340
security and how do we write<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure code</font>

134
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,560
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think we really talked a lot</font>

135
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,789
about this last one which is how can we

136
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,220
break down the wall between development

137
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,470
and security monitoring<font color="#CCCCCC"> so how do we get</font>

138
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,820
rid of those blue rooms or maybe keep

139
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rooms but instead of having one</font>

140
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,740
giant<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's have one for</font>

141
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,630
every team<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you write some code you're</font>

142
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,000
the one responsible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes down at</font>

143
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,880
night and you're responsible for the

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,770
availability of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you understand</font>

145
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,570
how it works and how to keep it running

146
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,520
you also should get those alerts when

147
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,849
you're getting attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey there's some</font>

148
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,070
weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> sequel queries coming in well I</font>

149
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,570
don't know if those are anomalous or not

150
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,800
but the team that wrote the product they

151
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">could tell you right away whether it</font>

152
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,650
looks normal or not

153
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:59,830
so why not let them do that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

154
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,229
put this up here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe maybe a</font>

155
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,820
little bit of a misnomer but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm so what</font>

156
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is most small engineering</font>

157
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,510
organizations don't usually have things

158
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,310
like performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> teens scalability teams</font>

159
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,840
and availability teams<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

160
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room that work on</font>

161
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,989
teams like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so lying a little bit</font>

162
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,060
but

163
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">in general a lot of companies don't have</font>

164
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,450
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things so if we don't have</font>

165
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,870
those things why do we have security

166
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:27,140
teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's let's step back for a</font>

167
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,610
second and assume that we do have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BB</font>

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">like go running around the organization</font>

trying to convince everyone that you

173
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,320
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ride past code</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to write</font>

177
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,610

<font color="#E5E5E5">spend just like tons of resources doing</font>

things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> data science and ml so that</font>

182
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,890
we can try to like find that one needle

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the haystack anomaly for all these</font>

things that really you could probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

185
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">walk up to the teams that are writing</font>

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,430
these products and say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> painting</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weird</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it weird</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I feel like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> totally normal but that other</font>

thing over there that<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> normal to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font>

191
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:16,370
that's actually really weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we do</font>

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:20,810
all of these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> in security for some</font>

reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why but doesn't have</font>

194
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,960
to be that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> so product teams</font>

195
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,320
understand their product better than

196
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,059
everyone else<font color="#CCCCCC"> we said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">decentralized security monitoring we get</font>

198
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,030
another benefit to we can eliminate this

199
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">back-and-forth politics and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">organization between groups right how</font>

202
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,050
many times you guys work on security

203
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,000
teams have you had a try and convince

204
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:46,339
someone that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security of some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dark</font>

205
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,110
fixing security was important<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had to</font>

206
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">ask delete it up the chain to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vp</font>

207
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,510
involved

208
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,960
this is so important we need to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

209
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,880
fixed it seems like the developers don't

210
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,470
care about security that's what it seems

211
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,720
like from our perspective but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

212
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,830
when you really start talking back and

213
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,690
forth and you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that communication</font>

214
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't have this barrier you realize</font>

215
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,290
that's not really the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> people do</font>

216
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,640
care about security<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just don't</font>

217
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,860
really know where to start

218
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:15,410
if you tell someone hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> go secure that</font>

219
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:17,630
thing work where do I even start<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

220
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">are someone who works on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a red team</font>

221
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,080
or your pen tester and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacked</font>

222
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,790
things do you really know how to fix

223
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,830
those things some people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

224
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,829
bolts<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a lot of times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've seen</font>

225
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,770
people say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I broke</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're saying</font>

226
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:31,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">I found an excess and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they forget</font>

227
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,260
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> help me help me fix it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

228
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">all I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know i have used that</font>

229
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,360
language before so we get those people

230
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,100
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> get everyone working together</font>

231
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,970
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we can get the benefits</font>

232
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,130
we saw from<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over in this new this</font>

233
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,230
new model with security as well so what

234
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,210
we saw with<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if teams on the</font>

235
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,190
full stack of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> products</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than their</font>

236
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,360
more responsible in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going</font>

237
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,090
to build things that are more reliable

238
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,640
because frankly<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't want to</font>

239
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:59,110
get page for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing going down so if</font>

240
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,180
you also say that

241
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,850
hey security is also your responsibility

242
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,319
then you can you can be pretty sure that

243
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,910
people are going to start thinking about

244
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,920
security and they're gonna come after

245
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:13,719
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to FK how how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i secure this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

246
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,860
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw this in our organization</font>

247
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:20,320
when we started pushing this down and

248
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,970
promoting this model we changed from a

249
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,190
mode where the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> team was going</font>

250
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,660
after each<font color="#E5E5E5"> dev team and poking at them</font>

251
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is important what</font>

252
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,230
are you doing there

253
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scan your stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from that</font>

254
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">the teams are actually coming after us</font>

255
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,120
and saying hey we want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> throat</font>

256
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,080
moaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey we want to we want to know</font>

257
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,090
how do we fix this this particular

258
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,650
vulnerability that the scanner says we

259
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,450
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> good what's the best way to fix it</font>

260
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,520
and that was that was pretty often<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

261
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,020
kind of exciting for me to not have to

262
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,340
be the bad guy and instead actually be

263
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:52,150
someone that can help

264
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,620
so the security team is not responsible

265
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,660
for security and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

266
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,200
model where we're trying to adapt<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

267
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:02,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that opendns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything is</font>

268
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,150
responsible for their own security<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

269
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,890
it's nice and easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm sure</font>

270
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,079
that if you all went back to your

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">company's or wherever you spend your</font>

time tomorrow and you said hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sister Rose might not be so happy so</font>

00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's two things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for one thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

276
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,810
really does have to get support from the

277
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,370
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upper level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> directors</font>

279
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,230
they need to like be on board with this

280
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:34,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that engineering teams are responsible</font>

281
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:35,020
for security as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,030
building

<font color="#E5E5E5">just like availability is just like</font>

performances<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know engineers don't</font>

285
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,220
usually say like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my code</font>

286
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,920

287
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,820
show but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hear people say that for</font>

288
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,170
security like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know about</font>

289
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,450
security like the security team will

290
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,490
handle it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that is one thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font>

291
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">like come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down from from the from the</font>

top<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the second thing is that</font>

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,370
the security team<font color="#E5E5E5"> then needs to start</font>

294
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,110
shifting focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not saying you</font>

295
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,520
shouldn't have security teams and that

296
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">we all just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped showing up to work</font>

297
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm saying is that we need to</font>

298
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:08,860
shift what we spend our time doing so

299
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,690
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing manual triaging and</font>

300
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,790
processing and trying to scan things and

301
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,930
find who owns this asset that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I scan</font>

302
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:17,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it had a high criticality</font>

303
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:19,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerability we should leave that to</font>

304
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,830
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> teams and let them do it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

order<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

306
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:26,260
need some more time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> development</font>

307
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:28,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">developing security tools doing doing</font>

308
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,160
doing education to an extent but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I worry</font>

309
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,190
a little bit to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as I think</font>

310
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,459
we need to make it extremely easy for

311
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,140
developers to use things like if you're

312
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,830
if you're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jenkins to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see I</font>

313
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">for example a lot of development teams</font>

314
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,760
will run things like winters right

315
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,650
oh my<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to run this winter to make</font>

316
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,410
sure that my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python code is is really</font>

317
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:54,819
pretty and follow the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

318
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:57,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">unlike kept 80 why not just run you know</font>

319
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,930
something like bandit in there as well

320
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">right in your reading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your job i think</font>

321
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,959
if you see those things coming in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

322
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix them it's kind of</font>

323
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:09,010
like a gamification<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sorts</font>

324
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:10,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so enough preaching that idea so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

325
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools that were</font>

326
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,800
hacking on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

327
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,500
going in that direction of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of empowering</font>

328
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:22,870
developers to do security<font color="#E5E5E5"> are to take on</font>

329
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:24,220
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> very early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stages with this so</font>

330
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,370
really really interested to get feedback

331
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:30,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">afterwards and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> financial chat but the</font>

332
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,750
principles here are that they need to

333
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,550
easily fit into the current teams were

334
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">closed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't build some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool</font>

335
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going to require them to spend a</font>

336
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,800
lot of effort to get started or else

337
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to want to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

338
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,760
find what they're already using like

339
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,920
maybe you use get<font color="#CCCCCC"> oven inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or maybe</font>

340
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,800
you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> j</font>

341
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and integrated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in with those things even</font>

342
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,099
if you don't like them very much it

343
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,260
doesn't matter like just just integrated

344
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,260
in what<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the easiest</font>

345
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,250
solution for the developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

346
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,639
reinventing the wheel

347
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:02,670
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know yet</font>

348
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:05,639
another secret management tool or get

349
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,560
another name your name your tool right

350
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to just use the stuff that's</font>

351
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,529
already out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's really</font>

352
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,779
something not there we can write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

353
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:14,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">open source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but so good source</font>

354
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:15,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">community is amazing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like let's take</font>

355
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,910
advantage of that and let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

356
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">just enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> co2 integrated in with our</font>

automated make it easy don't don't like

362
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,160
make someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to manually do</font>

363
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,360
something and stupid simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

364
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">developer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to think about</font>

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,279
like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get this officer which</font>

00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">size should i use a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sec I heard that was</font>

367
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,490
kind of a cool thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> up-and-coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

368
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">no you shouldn't have to think about any</font>

369
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,260
of that just click<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> button</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and click</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

370
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the call an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API and you'll get a search</font>

371
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,790
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll talk about tools so the first</font>

372
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,130
tool is called starboard<font color="#CCCCCC"> again like</font>

373
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,740
extremely simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">not fancy at all what we were looking</font>

375
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,510
for was just a way to do very very

376
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:11,220
simple port scanning so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:36,720
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> a WSB sequences</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> developers</font>

388
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:38,250
themselves are<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dr. we have we</font>

389
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,510
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dr hosting platform that has its</font>

390
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,040
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> little firewall thing for each</font>

391
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,300
container<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the developers are</font>

392
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">writing that they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

393
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:48,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the internet there's no sign off</font>

394
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so how can they monitor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that things</font>

395
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,260
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the way they want them to look</font>

396
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so we were the super simple thing</font>

397
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spin up these little</font>

398
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,539
and that skin

399
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you for skins that</font>

400
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,598
different perspectives in your network

401
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,789
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I made a really simple even more</font>

402
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:04,349
simple example here which was let's say

403
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:06,809
I just have something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to know</font>

404
00:16:04,349 --> 00:16:10,619
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports can access from inside my</font>

405
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:11,969
network and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports from outside and</font>

406
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:13,259
then it compares those things to a

407
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,879
baseline to the developers themselves

408
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:18,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">around a little baseline in the animal</font>

409
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if anything is different that goes</font>

410
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:22,649
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nagios because nagios is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

411
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're we're all using for how many</font>

412
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:27,779
decades<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's still nothing better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

413
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:30,299
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we rely on for monitoring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

414
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,789
if it builds into their their their

415
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:35,220
workflow<font color="#E5E5E5"> today so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything anyway if</font>

416
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:36,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">something changes that will turn red and</font>

417
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">audios and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's a bad enough thing</font>

418
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another page duties</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so teams</font>

419
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:43,649
are using this and teams are learning

420
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,929
things about the things that they built

421
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:48,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">didn't even know like all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't even</font>

422
00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:50,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize that for it was open and it was</font>

423
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:52,739
only internal so that's good but still

424
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:56,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">why is that open</font>

425
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:58,409
yeah that's that

426
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,179
so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> half the next to us that</font>

427
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:02,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl</font>

428
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:07,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">certs like when I'm calling dead simple</font>

429
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:09,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we for for a long time and still in</font>

430
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:12,539
many cases have this very you know

431
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,549
manual process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm sure a lot of a</font>

432
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,990
lot of people have where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> developers</font>

433
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:18,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">are having to figure out how to create a</font>

434
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,539
key and then how do i create the<font color="#CCCCCC"> csr</font>

435
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:23,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> command</font>

436
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:27,388
copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and paste them and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

437
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:30,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">somehow upload my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> co-star to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CA and</font>

438
00:17:27,388 --> 00:17:33,059
it's very very complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> we started</font>

439
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,669
using a tool from<font color="#E5E5E5"> netflix called lemur</font>

440
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is really awesome by the way and</font>

441
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:41,220
that helped us move forward quite a bit

442
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">so developers instead we're going to</font>

443
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool and they were requesting</font>

444
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,370
search from there and then nothing kind

445
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:48,870
of does the magic for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we wanted</font>

446
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,889
to make it like even easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> how can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

447
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,049
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it even easier</font>

448
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:57,178
so what we're building is this thing

449
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:59,460
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> bins and basically you call this</font>

450
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">api api out how an assert</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with these</font>

451
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,029
domains<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they just have like</font>

452
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:06,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">this to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> store it up</font>

453
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">opendns and stored</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on umbrella</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

454
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:11,190
it will do is in the back end it will

455
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:13,500
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay was a public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we facing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> certain</font>

456
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">or any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other unit doesn't need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

457
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,710
publicly trusted or not and if it's

458
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,150
publicly<font color="#CCCCCC"> trusted then it'll go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

459
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">encryption and we'll get it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

460
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,700
free

461
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:24,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get results</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put the</font>

462
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:28,290
key involved and we have these other

463
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:29,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">options there too so there's there's a</font>

464
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,200
limit to how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> search you can get</font>

465
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,020
letting everybody was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 per week</font>

466
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,210
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> org</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if we hit that limit then we</font>

467
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:40,350
fell over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deter and then we'll pay</font>

468
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:42,630
for it but hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will go</font>

469
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,909
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and let people are listening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

470
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">raise the limits and then if there's</font>

471
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:48,030
something internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually haven't</font>

472
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,940
implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> this yet but we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

473
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,889
doing that since then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll hit</font>

474
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,419
our internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get an internal</font>

475
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">server because we do a lot of things</font>

476
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,610
like container to container

477
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:03,600
communication or anything that we want

478
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:06,000
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> client-side search for but this</font>

479
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,879
still wasn't easy enough because then

480
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,590
the developers now get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cert and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

481
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,669
gets the pointer to the key involved but

482
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,549
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to figure out how to</font>

483
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:17,280
deploy from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ball which isn't that hard</font>

484
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:18,990
but why not make it even easier so we

485
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,299
have this thing called<font color="#CCCCCC"> quadra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is a</font>

486
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,460
container platform which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like</font>

487
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:25,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cooper Nettie's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we started working on</font>

488
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,360
this thing like before<font color="#CCCCCC"> communities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

489
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,630
released<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's why we're not using</font>

490
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we deploy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most of our</font>

491
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,070
things on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> quadra now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we thought</font>

492
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:37,020
how can be integrated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> quadrants so</font>

493
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,720
they can just have one stop shop so

494
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,030
basically now what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> developers</font>

495
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,610
can go right<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quadra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when they're</font>

496
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,230
deploying their containers and there's a

497
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,760
special type of container in<font color="#CCCCCC"> quadro that</font>

498
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:50,340
we have it was just a simple load

499
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,340
balancer<font color="#CCCCCC"> previously you would have had</font>

500
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:56,129
to take the<font color="#CCCCCC"> although certain material</font>

501
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,809
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> give it to it as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or two</font>

502
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">our secret</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> storage so we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do it</font>

503
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">downloaded but it was so so kind of</font>

504
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,409
clunky so this way now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could say had</font>

505
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">won a load balancer and I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

506
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,350
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and these are the two</font>

507
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,620
domains that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be running on</font>

508
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:12,780
that on that load balancer<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuadras ok</font>

509
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,399
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and talks to visit in</font>

510
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">service and it gets the surfer you and</font>

511
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the load balancer and when it</font>

512
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,300
