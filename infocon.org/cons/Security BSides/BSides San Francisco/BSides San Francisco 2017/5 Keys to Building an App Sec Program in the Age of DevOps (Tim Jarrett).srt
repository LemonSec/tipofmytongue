you're an idiot<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is not necessarily</font>

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,739
the right way to think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you really need to be thinking about</font>

the way that the market of tools that

148
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,880
the perspective that a lot of people go

149
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,669
to when they start thinking about DevOps

150
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go back to first principles</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go back</font>

151
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:00,780
to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> gene Kim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talks about the Phoenix</font>

we're trying to do here right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is you know not intended to be a full</font>

157
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,930
introduction to what DevOps is go read

158
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,549
those two books if you want that but you

159
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,080
know just for the sake of<font color="#CCCCCC"> refresher</font>

160
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,870
we're talking about systems thinking

161
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,359
we're not thinking about death as a silo

162
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">options the silo or now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security as a</font>

silo either<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're thinking about the</font>

164
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,300
end-to-end process through which those

165
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,830
groups work together to deliver value to

166
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,870
the customers that's the first way

167
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,719
system thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second way is</font>

168
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,160
getting feedback feedback loops<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,750
when something goes wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> in part of the</font>

170
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,180
process you get it back to the beginning

171
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,200
as quickly as you can so that you can

172
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">correct it</font>

173
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,610
the third way is continuously

174
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,620
experimenting and learning so that as

175
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,810
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know continue to go down this path</font>

176
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,940
you continually find better ways to

177
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,930
improve your process so that you make

178
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,180
things better

179
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and none of this is new right these are</font>

all insights from manufacturing from

<font color="#CCCCCC">10 years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

from a security perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do we</font>

188
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">do kind of want to think about with</font>

189
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:20,280
these three principles right number one

190
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">security is part of the system it's not</font>

191
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,969
outside it's something that happens

192
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,120
during the process of software

193
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:29,250
development to ensure that you are we

194
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,770
delivering secure functionality that

195
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:35,520
can't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know hacked or taken over</font>

by an outside actor<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's also part of</font>

197
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,030
the operation function because you want

198
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,039
to actually understand what's happening

199
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,258
to the code that you deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

200
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,180
in production and respond quickly if

00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,940
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> security relevant happens</font>

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're part of the feedback loop because</font>

203
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,469
if something happens from a security

204
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,180
perspective along this pipeline<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

205
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,550
to very quickly get back to first

206
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,590
principles and help the folks who

207
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,650
introduced that issue understand it and

208
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:04,198
correct it and security has unique

209
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:06,900
knowledge that helps people do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

210
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,610
developers don't understand the<font color="#CCCCCC"> abstract</font>

211
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,888
threat landscape they don't understand

secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> footing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> principles so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Security's</font>

213
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:15,300
job is to help enable them to respond to

214
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:16,620
these feedback loops and number<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

215
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,169
engaging<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the culture of</font>

216
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,639
experimentation and learning so that

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:23,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">everybody is getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

218
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,659
better and so when you do that you can

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,820
really start to think of security as

220
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:28,590
part of this assembly line<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of</font>

221
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,210
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> factory so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're going to do</font>

222
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,948
is we go through the rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

223
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">presentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is talk about some concrete</font>

224
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,930
ways that we can take that idea and and

225
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,689
pull it backwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> but first I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

226
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:42,598
talk a little bit about talking about

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,850
security with folks who are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> practicing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DevOps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and help you</font>

229
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,810
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way that you can frame it</font>

230
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,790
so that they understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of why</font>

231
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,969
this is even a concern

232
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:56,250
there's a guy that I work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> who his</font>

with developers about security issues

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,810
and he writes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

239
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,810

grieving process<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get a you know kind</font>

of complete denial that there's a

security problem you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> angry at the</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ran the scan you get</font>

bargaining to try to push issues off the

245
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,109
table you get sadness and throwing up

246
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,790
your hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> and security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is futile and</font>

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually you get to acceptance which</font>

248
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,180
is you know you're actually engaging

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,920
with security in the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is most developers never get</font>

253

that security is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a completely different</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sphere and we don't often talk about it</font>

are motivated to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

259
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,810
you know most developers who aren't

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,310
working at a security company and<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in terms of quality instead</font>

262
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,390
because ultimately what we're talking

263
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,580
about what we're talking about secure

264
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,830
coding standards is building a better

265
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,570
application that's more resilient in

266
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,760
production but instead of being

267
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,730
resilient against things like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

resource consumption and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

it the attribution is always fun

587

you have to figure out you know how to

go in and make that correction you have

589
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,980
to figure out how little of that you can

590
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,870
get away with correcting so that you

591
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,899
don't totally blow your schedule right

592

reduce the size of the the code that

00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:27,029
there's a clash between what security

that the tools get ripped out of the

don't give them any knowledge about how

819
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,510
that's hugely important but also because

826
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:49,090
so what do you use for monitoring well

827
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:53,440
we go from the most mature solutions

828
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:54,760
like looking at your logs right to you

829
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">know other solutions that are a little</font>

830
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,460
bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine control of fine-grained in</font>

831
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,990
terms of what they can report<font color="#CCCCCC"> web</font>

832
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,540
application firewalls for all their

833
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,250
faults can actually monitor for

834
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:08,500
suspicious issues and you can look for

835
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,700
those they are they can be noisy because

836
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,130
they're based on packet inspection

837
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a new category emerging called</font>

838
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">runtime application self-protection that</font>

839
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">sits inside the runtime such</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

840
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,219
like interactive testing does<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:23,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't production and you know you can</font>

842
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:27,370
run those<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just watch for suspicious</font>

843
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:29,889
security events again<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new technology</font>

844
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,750
category<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i would recommend you know</font>

845
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,890
at least taking a look at it to see if

846
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,990
it will help you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of</font>

00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">visibility in production</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font>

848
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:39,370
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to track what actually</font>

849
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that code once it's deployed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

850
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,070
that you can get the learnings back

851
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,730
earlier in the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> as soon as</font>

852
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:47,679
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> so really my answer to where do</font>

853
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,680
you secure applications under

development in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Devil's process is you</font>

855
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,890
think about it every step of the way

856
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,560
from when the developers are working to

857
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,720
the build process<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a talk earlier</font>

858
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,040
about container security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and I think</font>

859
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,600
that you do need to think about the

860
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,629
security of the components that are

861
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,389
being packaged in<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know all the</font>

862
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">way out to operations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

863
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,290
that you can do in every step of that

864
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,210
process that will help address the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

865
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,129
issue of security and the beauty of

866
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,530
DevOps is because it is this incremental

867
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:18,280
model<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have to do it all at</font>

868
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,129
once

869
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">pick one get it working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iterate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pick</font>

871
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,310
working iterate and you'll be much more

872
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,660
successful and if you try to take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

873
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">bang approach or if you try to</font>

874
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:35,020
concentrate just on one area<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

875
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:37,810
pipeline<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that with that I am</font>

876
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:40,710
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap and see what questions</font>

877
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,710
people have in the room

<font color="#CCCCCC">we take one of the line thank you very</font>
