1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,960
all right everyone we are getting ready

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,799
to start our next talk

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,720
our next speaker is carla sung given

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,960
sorry

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,639
and she is going to talk about

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,400
uga

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,359
thank you

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,039
thank you

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,439
thank you so much

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,719
there we go

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,760
um hello everyone my name is carla sun i

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,399
am a security partner on the uh the

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,600
product security team at gusto and today

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,200
i'm going to talk to you about

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,480
i'm going to talk to you about security

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,480
incident response

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,280
um

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,600
today in particular

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,280
what it takes to develop and scale out

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
an effective security incident response

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,480
program

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
rather than be like cave people relying

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,359
on blunt force trauma or attempting to

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,199
reinvent the wheel from scratch

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,320
we'll actually examine incident response

26
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,159
and how it works in other non-software

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,119
fields

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,920
we can beg borrow steel their techniques

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,240
from harder lessons learned and make our

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,000
computer security incident response a

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,080
little bit easier

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560
um so i want to be explicit uh this talk

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,159
comes with a fundamental content warning

34
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,479
which is we will be taking a look at

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,640
aviation and medicine and the harder

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,000
lessons that they learn

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,439
and their incidents tend to come with a

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,439
cost in human lives

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,759
we had a crazy three years absolutely no

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,960
judgment if you don't want to hear about

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,759
this stuff consent matters to me

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,759
so why am i qualified to talk about

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,000
incident response and how to improve it

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
at present i am a security partner at

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,520
gusto but i was previously a security

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
incident response lead

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
this experience greatly motivates my

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,399
work as a security partner i joke to my

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,640
peers that i use all my trauma from

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,719
security incident response to try to

51
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,560
stop them from repeating at gusto

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,399
i'm also a contributor to a book that

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,399
was recently published reinventing cyber

54
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,640
security the chapter is

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,800
called confronting confronting

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,520
inherently flawed systems hi hello i am

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,000
an inherently flawed system i compare

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
confronting my own undiagnosed adhd

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
symptoms to high confronted inherently

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,319
flawed systems in computing and incident

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,520
response

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,800
thanks to everybody who came to the book

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,520
signing yesterday and uh we'll be giving

64
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,120
away more books on tuesday at rsa

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,800
so let's get started

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
in dealing with incident response it

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,920
feels like an endless and repetitive

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,400
cycle something bad happens you deal

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
with it in the moment the problem

70
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
returns in another context maybe some

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
details changed

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,680
maybe in the exact same way

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,480
infosec twitter is rife with examples of

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,239
people lamenting the state of affairs

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,800
the high level goal of incident response

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,120
is to in addition to mitigating a

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,720
particular incident is to help prevent

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
similar instance incidents from

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,000
happening in the future

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,080
[Music]

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
to do that

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,120
we need to build an effective program

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
that holistically tackles

84
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,959
all the incidents that occur over time

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,480
and integrate all the experience and

86
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,400
learnings from each in order to really

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,640
make us effective at building incident

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
response

89
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,440
this is key so that we don't have to

90
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,040
read the same sad stories over and over

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,120
again and it's not an easy task i may be

92
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,959
as i may as well be asking how do we

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,360
boil the ocean

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,239
um

95
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,840
as we know it's not possible which

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
brings me to the first historic lesson

97
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,959
that i believe we can learn in solving

98
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,239
these problems

99
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,760
which is that engineering has always

100
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,360
been about the ability to

101
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,879
problem solve

102
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,239
and

103
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,159
the benefit of computers has always been

104
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,319
to scale that ability to solve problems

105
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,840
the way that computing solves these

106
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,519
problems by recognizing patterns of

107
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,440
issues and resolving each issue in a way

108
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,040
that can be answered in smaller

109
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,519
questions

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,840
however the scale of problems solved by

111
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,319
consume computers also scales the

112
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,560
security issues that we see so then too

113
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,799
must we rely on pattern recognition and

114
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,360
breaking down huge problems

115
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,959
of

116
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,799
huge problems into smaller yes or no

117
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,959
questions so returning to the definition

118
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,239
of an incident

119
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,760
that is an event or an occurrence

120
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,519
we face thousands of little incidents

121
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,040
every day so where the heck do we start

122
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,720
when first putting together an incident

123
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,040
response program um we are like babies

124
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,639
who don't even know how to crawl we need

125
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,080
to work learn how to walk and then run

126
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,199
so

127
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,160
any problem complex task or hurdle we

128
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,360
need to learn how to

129
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,840
crawl walk then run and security being

130
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,400
the huge mess as it is is good to draw

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,919
inspiration from the people who know

132
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,919
what they're doing when faced with a

133
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,680
huge mess

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
that's marie kondo

135
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
marie kondo famously enabled people to

136
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,000
tackle large anxiety-inducing situations

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
to organize their home like engineering

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
she has a script

139
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,199
that allows her to break things down

140
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
into smaller problems so marie kondo's

141
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,560
method is put everything in a pile

142
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,080
decide and label if everything's going

143
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
to be keep donate or trash

144
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
then she teaches them to organize her

145
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
their items in such a way that can be

146
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,600
easily cataloged

147
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,160
and then she asks you to repeat clothing

148
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,440
kitchen items books sentimental items

149
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,039
if we match marie kondo's method to

150
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,560
crawling walking and running we can

151
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,240
similarly apply

152
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,639
pattern solving a pattern when problem

153
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,199
solving we must scope quantify and

154
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,800
recognize patterns before we can scale

155
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,320
problem resolution to meet the supply

156
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,639
and scale of problems to solve

157
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,960
this pattern in problem solving

158
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,800
we can apply directly to marie's condo

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
method to security incidents by putting

160
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,039
all the incidents in one place

161
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,440
prioritizing risks and efforts and

162
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880
vulnerabilities

163
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,560
recognizing patterns by organizing this

164
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,479
information in bold management and risk

165
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,639
registers before we can effectively

166
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,400
leverage the wealth of data available to

167
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,240
iterate and scale upon processes and

168
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,280
responses to any given security incident

169
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,120
now that i've defined the pile or scope

170
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,720
of the problem i'm trying to demonstrate

171
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,440
in building security incident response

172
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,960
let's focus in on prioritizing

173
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
vulnerabilities risks and efforts

174
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,919
so the first act um let's learn how to

175
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,600
crawl and to crawl we must figure out

176
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,520
how to prioritize vulnerabilities risks

177
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,280
and efforts

178
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,560
um

179
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,479
what's a vulnerability uh it's a flaw in

180
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,319
a system that weakens overall security

181
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
of that system and in general a

182
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
confirmed vulnerability usually has a

183
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,360
fairly clear root cause and a mitigation

184
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,240
plan

185
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,039
which brings me to my first example

186
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,560
in referencing

187
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,479
aviation which is

188
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,880
uh landing an aircraft

189
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,560
so this is a diagram depicting the

190
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
necessary components of an airport

191
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,400
whenever you're landing any aircraft

192
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
um how does air traffic control

193
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,639
prioritize which lan plane to land first

194
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,639
um usually in the best case scenarios

195
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,479
there's a schedule

196
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,919
in the rare case that something does

197
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,319
happen a schedule has to be disrupted

198
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,800
disrupted and thanks to experience atc

199
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,560
generally knows what to do

200
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,120
so when systems are all normal

201
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,800
and you know there happens to be

202
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,400
aircrafts at the same altitude

203
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
the priority actually goes to the

204
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
aircraft with the least amount of

205
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,919
maneuverability so hot air balloon

206
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,560
doesn't have a lot of ways to maneuver

207
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,720
has a right-of-way over gliders gliders

208
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,000
over airships and airships over

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,800
airplanes but what if one aircraft is

210
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,039
vulnerable or what if multiple aircrafts

211
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,639
are in distress at the same time within

212
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,000
the vicinity of the same airport

213
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,319
so in a landing emergency

214
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,800
the scope of the problem is the plane's

215
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,240
the number of expected planes in that

216
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,319
airspace as well as the airports

217
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,680
to quantify the situation step one

218
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,639
uh

219
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,680
you have to figure out what the

220
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,319
situation is and get all that data so is

221
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,680
the plane on fire is there a medical

222
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,319
emergency is there equipment failure um

223
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,240
atc will always ask a pilot how many

224
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,160
souls are on board and how much

225
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
available fuel is left

226
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,319
uh the number of planes that are nearby

227
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,919
that we're planning on landing there or

228
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,680
in close proximity

229
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,919
those additional stats also need to be

230
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,520
tabulated

231
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,919
step two in organizing we need to make

232
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,919
decisions so planes with enough

233
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,680
resources that are really really close

234
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
by maybe they can hold at different

235
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,879
altitudes

236
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,240
planes with enough resources that are

237
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,840
far away enough can possibly divert

238
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,680
other airports

239
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,520
more importantly the

240
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,319
goal here is to clear the runway so that

241
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,160
the plane that's in distress can land as

242
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,120
safely as possible

243
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,599
the third step in iterating and scaling

244
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,280
everybody writes a report

245
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,120
they gather data from black boxes which

246
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,879
is our equivalent of logs

247
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,159
and

248
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,479
if something unfortunately happens

249
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,719
usually the faa and the ndsb

250
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,640
investigates

251
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,839
so how do we apply this to

252
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,679
vulnerabilities well

253
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,919
when i was a baby application security

254
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,600
engineer i had one pile of things to

255
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,279
manage to manage and that was bug bounty

256
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,720
reports

257
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,279
um quantifying the severity of each

258
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,880
report was

259
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,560
one of the first things that i did with

260
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,120
my bug bounty program and i used various

261
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,279
tools like the cvss calculator the bug

262
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,000
crowd vrt and additional data that i

263
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,959
thought was interesting

264
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,480
so um

265
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,160
my journey with application security and

266
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,560
bug bounties uh kind of lacked

267
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,640
consistency and communication in the art

268
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,200
of priority and so uh bug crowd actually

269
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
resolved this for me with the vrt that

270
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,000
stands for vulnerability rating taxonomy

271
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,519
it was first used as a baseline when it

272
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,839
was introduced in 2016.

273
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,760
uh the nice thing is that the vrt itself

274
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,600
has evolved to cover even more context

275
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,279
than it originally did

276
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,680
and uh the early versions of the of the

277
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,760
vrt best served me as an abstract

278
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,680
engineer until i switched to security

279
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,399
incident response

280
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,959
um so the cvss calculator if you've

281
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,640
never encountered it before it counts

282
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,880
it's called common vulnerability scoring

283
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,160
system

284
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,480
it allows you to across

285
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,360
various selections calculate like what

286
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,040
is the priority that you should be

287
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,519
having on a given vulnerability

288
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,600
um what i loved about cvss is that it

289
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,760
covered nearly every situation related

290
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,000
to computers which hey so does security

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,560
incident response the base metric

292
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,079
as you can see accounts for

293
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,320
exploitability and directly incorporates

294
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,560
impact to the cia triangle which you can

295
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
definitely see confidentiality integrity

296
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,880
and availability

297
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,480
temporal metrics allow you to also

298
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,160
determine what the score is in terms of

299
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,079
was it a zero day is there no patch or

300
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,839
is there a patch incoming

301
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,160
the environmental metric group accounts

302
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,760
for special circumstances related to

303
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
your environment because we are all

304
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,440
special snowflakes

305
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,399
every cve has a cvss score and when

306
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,000
everybody speaks the same language

307
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,720
communication is faster less mistakes

308
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,839
are made less misunderstandings

309
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,240
the beauty of the cvss calculator in

310
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,560
practice was that my colleagues and i

311
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,640
were never more than like a full number

312
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,480
off when it came to comparing our cvss

313
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
evaluations which meant we were all on

314
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,240
board with how severe the situation was

315
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,600
these are examples of metrics that i

316
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,440
found really useful to track alongside

317
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
what i saw in cvss and what i got from

318
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
the vrt

319
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,800
things like the priority how much we

320
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,120
rewarded uh date reported resolved slas

321
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
who owned the fix who owned the service

322
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,640
that it was affecting

323
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,720
and most of these

324
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,560
stats were actually inspired by a talk i

325
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,959
watched here at b-sides in 2018 by

326
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
arkiti i probably butchered your name

327
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,720
i'm so sorry but it inspired a lot of my

328
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,320
work in bug body

329
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
um

330
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,800
so uh once you've organized all these

331
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,640
datas

332
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,279
you know you are able to quickly sort

333
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,279
like what are completed issues what are

334
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,480
old

335
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,240
old and overdue issues what's missing

336
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
sla and what are the overall

337
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
vulnerability categories that we're

338
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
seeing and trending in our bug bounty

339
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
metrics

340
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,480
to iterate all this data

341
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,079
it allowed me to prioritize which tools

342
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,200
which are the most common

343
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,240
vulnerabilities were tied to teams and

344
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,079
also to prioritize which secure code

345
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,800
trainings i wanted to focus on next

346
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,120
um i eventually applied this methodology

347
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,560
to the way that we were handling

348
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,200
internally uh reported findings and then

349
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,120
eventually we i used the same

350
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,800
methodology to

351
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,040
evaluate our security incident response

352
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
vulnerabilities

353
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,200
it was thanks to all this aggregate data

354
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,800
related to my bug bounty that i knew on

355
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
a monthly quarterly and yearly basis

356
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
what our most common vulnerabilities

357
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,800
were and like i said i could tailor

358
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,079
secure code training and content

359
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,519
specifically to promote awareness

360
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,399
mitigations and best practices based

361
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,399
making a database decision

362
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,639
um i also put out a yearly

363
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,800
state of the union report of bug bounty

364
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,560
and it allowed our security engineering

365
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,240
teams to prioritize what their next

366
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,959
project was as well

367
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,880
additional data that i was able to get i

368
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,800
could point out which teams had the most

369
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,680
overdue issues and how many days overdue

370
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,720
in presenting this information to my cto

371
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,320
my cto could request that each team

372
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
prioritize these issues

373
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
um

374
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,360
this helped my developers reset their

375
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,600
priorities especially when stuff was

376
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,200
overdue and they didn't know where to

377
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,880
fit it with all of their pre-existing

378
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,240
priorities

379
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,920
the most interesting trend is actually

380
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
the chart on the right um

381
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
and some time in like 2017 i had built

382
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,240
an automatic reminder bot for overdue

383
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,279
issues

384
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,839
uh and in 2018 because i'm a terrible

385
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,240
programmer the bot was broken

386
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,600
i checked the reminders and the

387
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,600
reminders actually stopped back in april

388
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,639
um

389
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,120
so clearly the number of overdue issues

390
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,399
spiked

391
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,839
until i figured out that the bot was

392
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,880
broken

393
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,440
uh in q4 i turned it back down on and it

394
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,839
continued to trend downwards well into

395
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,120
2019

396
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
and i wouldn't have noticed this if i

397
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,399
had not gathered the data and tracked

398
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,560
the behavior

399
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,240
i go into more details about these

400
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,600
findings and in my accidental experiment

401
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,680
at this talking peninsula the link will

402
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,560
be

403
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,120
in my slides and the slides will be

404
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,800
on my

405
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,040
twitter account no later than tomorrow

406
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,560
but the thing to know is that

407
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
prioritizing when and how to resolve

408
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,199
vulnerabilities ultimately reduces risks

409
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,480
when i approach teams with known

410
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,240
vulnerabilities usually the conversation

411
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,320
is to illustrate that impact so that

412
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,760
they can compare it with their

413
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,600
pre-existing priorities

414
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,600
and when we when we actually agree upon

415
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,399
that

416
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,000
something can actually get prioritized

417
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,680
and done

418
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,440
so what about everything in security

419
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,720
that doesn't have a clear success

420
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,240
criteria or really clear root cause

421
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,920
how do we prioritize a risk

422
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,720
so

423
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,279
a risk is a potential loss or a chance

424
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,519
or a situation that leads to said losses

425
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,480
and

426
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,680
um

427
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,600
looking to other industries and how they

428
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
handle risks we can actually look at

429
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,720
medicine

430
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,480
the unfortunate risk in medicine is

431
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,839
usually death when you walk into an er

432
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
how do they prioritize the patients when

433
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
it's not clear what the ruse cause what

434
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,079
the root cause is and therefore what the

435
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,120
potential treatment might actually be

436
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,959
and let's take for example me in april

437
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,839
2021 i was in a super bad way

438
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,199
but i was actually really worried that

439
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,560
they were going to take a bed from a

440
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,120
severe covet patient

441
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,880
when everything was said and done

442
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,199
i actually researched how hospitals

443
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,360
actually triage patients so

444
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
this is an example of an er triage

445
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,920
priority chart um the triage nurse will

446
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,160
check things like are you choking or is

447
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,320
your throat closing up you know from an

448
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,240
allergy

449
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,680
what's your blood pressure what's your

450
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,880
oxygen level heart rate coherence

451
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,399
they take your blood and a urine test

452
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,399
and i was solidly doing solidly between

453
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,240
a three and four on this particular

454
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,519
chart

455
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,480
um everyone that landed in red orange

456
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,800
yellow ahead of me yes please process

457
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,399
them first like

458
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,759
all things considered are probably would

459
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,600
have died after months of neglect rather

460
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,880
than seconds

461
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,199
so um

462
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,959
in the context of prioritizing risk in

463
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,160
the er

464
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,600
you have everybody that's in the er

465
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,120
waiting room potentially whatever

466
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,480
they're calling ahead for that's coming

467
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,040
in ambulances um the stats that i

468
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,959
mentioned on that chart earlier and then

469
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,320
treatment and monitoring which turned

470
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,440
out to be iv antibiotics and then

471
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,519
monitoring watching my heart rate come

472
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,600
back down as i was feeling better

473
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,360
ideally we see these uh situations as

474
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,279
either a confirmation of a checklist

475
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,199
that exists or an unfortunate

476
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,320
post-mortem in the worst case

477
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
so how can we apply this to security

478
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,519
risks

479
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,399
well

480
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,160
okay murray condo right we have to

481
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,639
compile all the risks threat models

482
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,759
audits and review findings into one pile

483
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,880
and

484
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
we're gonna have to crawl therefore

485
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
quantify we enabled we need to be able

486
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,959
to calculate the possibility of a risk

487
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,440
happening and what the impact is

488
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,959
and

489
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,199
you can't really calculate a possibility

490
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,360
at scale there are thousands of factors

491
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,959
to be aware of and computing the

492
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,639
compound possibilities of millions of

493
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,320
potential outcomes is freaking

494
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
impossible

495
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
so um

496
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,160
there are ways to tackle this um and the

497
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,079
easiest way is to the easiest way to

498
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,639
prioritize a risk is to quantify it so

499
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,319
this is an impact versus likelihood

500
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,640
matrix and it does exactly that

501
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,079
you take a risk and you consider how

502
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,319
likely it is to happen and you evaluate

503
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,760
what the damage is

504
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,959
if it is exploited or not mitigated

505
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,480
i think this is at least useful in

506
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,799
mapping your priorities and getting you

507
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,199
past decision paralysis because when you

508
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,880
have a lot of stuff it can be really

509
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,160
hard to start

510
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,319
a few downsides

511
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,760
about this method is that it doesn't

512
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,280
account for effort

513
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,400
and

514
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,080
if different people are evaluating

515
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,799
different risks every every person's

516
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,520
version of unlikely or extremely common

517
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,559
or rare are just slightly different

518
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,080
and it turns out mathematically the

519
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
errors lead to worse than random

520
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,280
outcomes

521
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,679
so it's not my preference to solely rely

522
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,679
on impact versus effort in a first case

523
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,720
basis

524
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,160
um

525
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,480
it's an okay stop-back gap it's not the

526
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,120
worst thing so this book how to measure

527
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,039
anything in cyber security risk

528
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,480
specifically says there's no need for

529
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,160
cyber security to reinvent

530
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
well-established quantitative methods

531
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,360
used in many equally complex problems

532
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,760
and so my proposal is that the cvss

533
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,000
score already accounts for likelihood by

534
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
quantifying exploitability as well as

535
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,559
impact so that's exploitability and

536
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,679
likelihood that's impact

537
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,640
first.org actually documents the history

538
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,240
and evolution of the calculator to

539
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,559
demonstrate its improvement and its

540
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,480
improvements in precision

541
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,000
and with that understanding it actually

542
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,080
improves my confidence and using this as

543
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
a consistent means to compare risks to

544
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,679
one another

545
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,919
so after evaluating what the priority is

546
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,440
on a particular risk

547
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,280
um

548
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,360
uh you know we compile all these risks

549
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
into a register and ideally we are

550
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,120
tracking the state of all collective

551
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,760
risks as we make improvements or whether

552
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,320
or not we grow in scope

553
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
from there we are able to prioritize

554
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,039
efforts and possibly mitigations sorry

555
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,799
mitigations based off of what we are

556
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,320
able to see trending in our risk

557
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
registers

558
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,080
i will reiterate that i believe that the

559
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,000
risk cannot uh

560
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,160
if you that if you really believe that a

561
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,080
risk cannot be captured by the cvss

562
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
calculator because maybe there's

563
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
something exist that i don't know

564
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,440
then you should utilize the impact

565
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,600
versus likelihood matrix to mitigate

566
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
hesitation

567
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
because doing something is better than

568
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,760
doing nothing

569
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,720
to reduce inconsistency in measuring the

570
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
priority of a risk across people there's

571
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,240
actually a technique that i learned from

572
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,400
eighth grade science class

573
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,160
which is um

574
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,320
does this look familiar to anyone raise

575
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,600
sign of hands

576
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,360
yeah okay so

577
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,960
it's a graduated cylinder and this is

578
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,039
used to measure the volume of liquids

579
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,640
and the unfortunate thing is that

580
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
everyone in your lab group measures

581
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
slightly differently

582
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,799
and so uh the technique here is to

583
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,039
actually have the same person

584
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,919
measure um every time

585
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,919
if somebody's off by 10 then they're at

586
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,799
least they're consistently off by 10

587
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,720
compared to having five different people

588
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,679
with five different variances measuring

589
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,159
like making five different deltas right

590
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,640
so the benefit of data is to be able to

591
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,720
observe changes between states or

592
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,200
conditions and using the same person

593
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,960
reduces the overall

594
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
evaluation variance compared to

595
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,039
different people in precisely making the

596
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,799
same measurement

597
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,120
i theorize that risk registers with one

598
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,360
administrator reduces qualitative

599
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,159
variance compared to every contributor

600
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,000
of registers giving their own version of

601
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,840
extremely likely or

602
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
rare so in conclusion the er clearly

603
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
knows that stats like oxygen coherence

604
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,240
bp and heart rate were the best stats to

605
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,640
triage er patients and the same must

606
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,880
happen if we are to go in any direction

607
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,120
to start mitigating risks

608
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,640
so

609
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,799
i've identified a ton of problems you've

610
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,480
i'm sure all identified a ton of

611
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,400
problems how are we going to start

612
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,840
fixing it

613
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,080
prioritizing risks and vulnerabilities

614
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,400
don't account for effort

615
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,080
that it would take to remediate or

616
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,320
mitigate them so how do we prioritize it

617
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,440
um

618
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,880
there are two types of efforts that i

619
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,720
think exist out there one is one with

620
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,880
absolute order uh you know you're

621
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,720
solving an ongoing emergency and you

622
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,480
already have the luxury and the

623
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,000
experience of knowing what order things

624
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,080
should go these are closer analogs to

625
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,200
playbooks

626
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,440
but playbooks require maturity

627
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,280
then there's there are efforts without a

628
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,760
clear order like a pile of

629
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,679
vulnerabilities and risks maybe they're

630
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,679
all the same priority

631
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,679
and i theorized actually that the

632
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,280
covenant 19 vaccination authorization

633
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,120
was analogous to how we can prioritize

634
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,720
effort

635
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,799
we had 300 million people in the in the

636
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,679
u.s

637
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,760
and by the end of 2020

638
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
vaccine supply was still limited due to

639
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,400
manufacturing constraints

640
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,559
vaccine authorization is actually sorted

641
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,320
by age and health status and

642
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,320
there was also the status of the

643
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,159
vaccines being available under emergency

644
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,080
authorization use so with these node

645
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,159
figures what's the best order to

646
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,120
prioritize distribution

647
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,440
so this chart is a very unscientific

648
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,880
assumption of how much effort it would

649
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,559
take to remediate covid while

650
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,159
unvaccinated

651
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,760
we knew that the risks to elderly

652
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
disabled and immunocompromised people

653
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,159
generally had worse outcomes this is

654
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,440
compared to

655
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,960
the cdc

656
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,720
vaccination schedule so the only thing

657
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,559
to know here in this column is the

658
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,799
number of vaccines that we're eligible

659
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,679
for

660
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,640
um

661
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,960
only grows as we hit certain age

662
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
milestones so like

663
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,880
3 5 17 whatever until you're past 65.

664
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,960
um

665
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,679
so

666
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,039
and then of course at the very top of

667
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,559
the list of

668
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,240
the highest number of vaccinations

669
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,679
available is usually for

670
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,840
immunocompromised individuals

671
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,760
um i noticed that the department of

672
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,679
health and human services authorized the

673
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,960
vaccine in the order of how many

674
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
vaccines the age group was eligible for

675
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,720
versus the likely impact of

676
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,559
complications from coven 19.

677
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,799
the age groups were based off of how we

678
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,799
studied vaccines in the past and which

679
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,520
ages they're considered necessary

680
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,679
so the populations were authorized but

681
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,840
vaccine supply was still limited so

682
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,520
there was another consideration i know

683
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,280
it feels like so long ago but this was a

684
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,360
resulting order of priority in cova-19

685
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,600
vaccine distribution um

686
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
yeah immunocompromised individuals were

687
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,840
able to get theirs even young even if

688
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,600
they were younger than 65 well before

689
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,120
the elderly or non-disabled people

690
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,880
so the cdc continued to distribute and

691
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
monitor the effectiveness of the coven

692
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,640
19 vaccine and they're able to conclude

693
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,240
that all approved vaccinations would

694
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,760
require boosters

695
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,279
currently the fourth shot is recommended

696
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,520
for elderly and severely immuno

697
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,639
compromised individuals

698
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,799
yeah so they figured that out right so

699
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,799
how do we sort security efforts that may

700
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,840
not have

701
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,960
an obvious order of operations

702
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,880
first we need to pile all the ideas

703
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,000
together so resolutions mitigations and

704
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,760
whatever your resource constraints are

705
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,240
and let's say that this is a list of

706
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,159
projects your team wishes to tackle how

707
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,000
do you choose one or over the other and

708
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,159
which efforts are actually worth doing i

709
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,440
believe that this question can actually

710
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,600
be resolved by a product design exercise

711
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
that sort of helps you prioritize and

712
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,279
organize your project ideas and this is

713
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,880
called an impact versus

714
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,039
effort matrix so

715
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,400
you have your team put all of their

716
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,600
project ideas and sticky notes

717
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,480
and the first exercise is to actually

718
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,279
order all the ideas in a row from lowest

719
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,440
to highest impact the only rule for this

720
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,840
step is no two projects can occupy the

721
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,159
same x coordinate so

722
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,559
your team should also start sorting

723
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,120
these things as advised this is also a

724
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,799
nice nice exercise to see if your team

725
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,880
can communicate why they believe what

726
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
projects will have the impact that

727
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,120
justifies their chosen order so

728
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,240
um

729
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,039
like to do it at

730
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,919
year planning yearly planning so they're

731
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,600
they're trying to figure out the order

732
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,080
and finally we have a nice row

733
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,679
after you are able to order everything

734
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,200
based off of low or high impact in order

735
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,919
um you repeat the excess the exercise

736
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,880
again vertically so you order your

737
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,480
project ideas from low to high effort

738
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
and you want to keep the same x

739
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,840
coordinate

740
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
of the sticky note so the same rule

741
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,080
applies when you are

742
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,840
putting everything in low to high effort

743
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,720
that no two project ideas can occupy the

744
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,799
same y-coordinate so let's say that your

745
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,880
team has already done this exercise

746
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,080
um

747
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,840
we'll draw some

748
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,440
interesting lines and i'm going to tell

749
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,120
you what all the lines mean

750
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,360
so the upper left quadrant

751
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,960
describes

752
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,520
projects that have low impact and high

753
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,799
effort and

754
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,400
essentially these

755
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,840
these kinds of ideas should be

756
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,159
reprioritized it would be considered a

757
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,840
luxury to complete these things because

758
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,799
there's a pretty low payoff to

759
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,279
what is being proposed

760
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,720
the upper right corner is something

761
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,159
that's considered

762
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,600
would contain all the projects that are

763
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,279
considered strategic there is a

764
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,960
significant amount of effort that is

765
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,039
needed to complete the project however

766
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,279
the impact can be seen as extremely

767
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,440
beneficial

768
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
the lower left quadrant is full of easy

769
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,960
wins so low impact low impact low effort

770
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,200
probably easy to prioritize

771
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,760
and the lower right quadrant are all of

772
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,240
the must-dos because they are low effort

773
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,159
and high impact

774
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,960
the parallel red lines means is meant to

775
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,720
be sort of a gauge for how practical

776
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,039
your team's project ideas are and

777
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,880
ideally you're either within or close to

778
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,799
the red lines and so this kind of like

779
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,159
brings up the question

780
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,559
um does your team end up accidentally

781
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,440
executing a lot of luxurious ideas that

782
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
end up in the upper left quadrant

783
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,520
um

784
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
is the team accidentally leaving must-do

785
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,120
projects behind

786
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,039
um you don't know until you kind of all

787
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,799
put it all together and compare them all

788
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,960
to each other and understand what the

789
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,200
team sees as beneficial to do and what

790
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,400
seems like a bit

791
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,600
like a bit of a waste of time

792
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,880
um

793
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,240
even with the impact versus effort

794
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,600
matrix there's limited time and

795
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,400
resources but at least this could help

796
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,559
um make it more obvious which projects

797
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,480
you should choose to prioritize and

798
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,120
which ones you shouldn't

799
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,960
when you retrospect your year quarter or

800
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,799
sprint you can see what was done what

801
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,200
was chosen and then decide what is best

802
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,000
to do next

803
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,919
utilize the wealth of data to know that

804
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,600
at least you did something and you did

805
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
good things to move the needle you

806
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,039
choose the most impactful efforts thanks

807
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,679
to the matrix and you know we know as

808
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,360
security professionals we will never win

809
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,960
forever

810
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,399
so at least use that

811
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,200
so

812
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,919
we know that computing relies on sorted

813
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,360
information that allows us to recognize

814
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,720
patterns and scale the way we solve

815
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,039
smaller broken-down problems

816
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,559
any old algorithm

817
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,000
we know that vulnerabilities we need to

818
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,480
quantify their serverities uh be able to

819
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,559
spot trends and then you know

820
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,799
strategically deploy effort

821
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,559
with vulnerabilities that are nebulous

822
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,480
in terms of what their outcomes might be

823
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,000
or what their root causes are there's

824
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,679
still value in quantifying and

825
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,960
prioritizing these risks

826
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,240
when it's all compiled in your risk

827
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,600
register you can use that to best

828
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,480
communicate potential proactive efforts

829
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,640
that may need leadership to justify in

830
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,760
terms of resources or even funding

831
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,720
and when you're ready with your

832
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,240
solutions and mitigations you either

833
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,600
already know what to do based off of

834
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,679
experience or you can put all of the

835
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,200
different solutions in an impact versus

836
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,720
effort matrix

837
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,600
these are obviously oversimplifications

838
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,039
of evaluation trade-offs

839
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,760
but it needs to be simplified because

840
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,960
we're going to have to apply all of

841
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,880
these thousands of little decisions to

842
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
resolve incidents you're going to get a

843
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
lot of reports you're going to have

844
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,720
limited resources you're going to have

845
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,360
to make tough calls quickly

846
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,200
time is of the essence when resolving

847
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,480
these incidents

848
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,840
so you want to reduce the amount of time

849
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,120
spent

850
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,480
so act two

851
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
how do you build security incident

852
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,640
response

853
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,159
beginning with our core principles to

854
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,919
scope quantify and recognize patterns of

855
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,919
scale

856
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,279
let's look at how pilots are meant to

857
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,240
resolve

858
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,039
aviation incidents now in an aviation

859
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,480
emergency

860
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,559
um to make sure i'm not spreading

861
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,640
unnecessarily unnecessary fear

862
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,559
uncertainty and doubt let's look at

863
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,039
available data related to us caregivers

864
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,880
so flying in the u.s is actually

865
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,360
incredibly safe we've had a 95

866
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,559
decrease in the uh in u.s air carrier

867
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,720
fatalities in the last 20 years i'm

868
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,520
really sorry i trip over that

869
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,279
and you know the pandemic didn't really

870
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,880
help

871
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,960
i believe this is because pilots know to

872
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,120
follow the same pattern in an aviation

873
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,799
emergency

874
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,880
when something goes wrong in the air the

875
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,279
pilot's scope is the plane

876
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,440
planes that might be nearby passengers

877
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,360
where they are what the plane is telling

878
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,120
you and let me tell you a modern

879
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,640
airliner tells you a lot of different

880
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,360
things at the same time

881
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,799
um

882
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,960
that's their essentially that

883
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,320
their murray condo pile of information

884
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,480
all that data allows pilots to organize

885
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,000
the data that they're receiving

886
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,520
understand their instruments and what

887
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,120
they're telling them and they use

888
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,360
previously recognized patterns to tell

889
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,158
to figure out what has happened

890
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,679
pilots usually have thousands of hours

891
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,279
of training before they actually go up

892
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,799
in the air and fly you around and

893
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,640
previous experience it makes them faster

894
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,720
at choosing the right checklist because

895
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,320
there's still so much to manage in the

896
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,000
cockpit

897
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,840
for example a pilot must holistically

898
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,520
decide how to handle all the tasks in

899
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,360
the air they must perform task

900
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,679
initiation monitoring prioritization

901
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,240
allocation interruption resumption

902
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,320
termination for every task there is

903
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,080
probably a checklist affiliated with it

904
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,000
up in the air

905
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,480
um so much so that pilots actually strap

906
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,919
whole computers and checklists to their

907
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,919
thighs these are called knee boards and

908
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,840
even with the references task management

909
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,760
requires mastery in knowing which

910
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,760
checklist to use and what data to

911
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,200
surmise from all of the different

912
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,120
telemetry on top of the telemetry that

913
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,600
is available on the aircraft

914
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,519
so thanks to the recognized patterns in

915
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,600
past emergencies pilots are now able to

916
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,840
prioritize their efforts in an emergency

917
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,159
because uh

918
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,840
in an emergency i'm sorry because of the

919
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,360
checklists

920
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,399
following the specified uh prioritize

921
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,240
and that allows them to prioritize

922
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,840
what's happening when you know that

923
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,840
first alarm comes on which is

924
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,679
uh okay

925
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,919
okay pilots when faced with an immediate

926
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,159
emergency have to follow three things in

927
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,559
this order which is to aviate navigate

928
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,880
then communicate basically that means

929
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,399
don't crash the plane

930
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,760
don't crash into a mountain while you're

931
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,200
trying to get in control of the plane

932
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,279
and then after only after you've done

933
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,039
those things you can talk things through

934
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,919
and try to debug the situation

935
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,279
they have to organize the incoming

936
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,120
tsunami of information

937
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,880
and process it and then prioritize their

938
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,080
efforts for the best possible outcome

939
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,760
the third step in scaling the benefits

940
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,600
of identifying problems in the best case

941
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,200
scenario there are no crashes or

942
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,159
fatalities and actually if all things go

943
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,240
well in a bad situation pilots can

944
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,320
confidentially and voluntarily file a

945
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,240
report of the issue they encountered

946
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,000
this leads to safer skies for everyone

947
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,320
but in the worst case scenario

948
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,880
there's a lot of oversight so ntsb comes

949
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,000
in does a post-mortem and the faa also

950
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,960
will

951
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
observe incidents in aggregate

952
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,320
prioritize passenger safety above all

953
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,559
else and then they do this to minimize

954
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,279
the occurrence of future accidents

955
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,080
and

956
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,000
they actually start rewriting and fixing

957
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,440
playbooks and checklists for padlets

958
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
let's apply this framework to the 737

959
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,279
max 8 aviation accident

960
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,320
in indonesia october 2018 lion air

961
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,960
flight 610 uh flew into the java sea 13

962
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
minutes after take off takeoff

963
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,000
people on the ground saw that the

964
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,120
aircraft was visibly pointing downwards

965
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,000
and

966
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,279
when they recovered the black box

967
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,480
telemetry

968
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,320
which is again the equivalent system of

969
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,640
application or system logging for us

970
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,840
they could tell that the plane was

971
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,799
trying to force itself downwards

972
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,720
pilots were receiving confusing warming

973
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,240
warnings and indications from their

974
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,120
instruments and recall aviate navigate

975
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,240
communicate

976
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,679
the incident was severe enough that they

977
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,559
never completed the 88 stage of

978
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,399
this priority list because there was too

979
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,360
much going on

980
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,519
the post crash investigation determined

981
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,960
that there was a newly added system

982
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,480
called mcas

983
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,240
it was discovered that it was not

984
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,320
documented in flight training at the

985
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,640
time for this new aircraft model

986
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,480
and the investigation side of the lack

987
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,039
of training with the new system

988
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,640
the new system created unexpected

989
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,480
behavior in the cockpit that the pilot

990
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,640
pilots were not trained on

991
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,240
the manufacturer announced that it would

992
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,840
update the aircraft software to fix the

993
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,519
issue and train pilots with an

994
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,120
additional playbook

995
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,200
until the software fix was distributed

996
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,880
upon discovery of the issue caused by

997
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,440
mcas the playbook was to disable the

998
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
system when it was suspected of

999
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,240
misoperation

1000
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
in our scope we have a stricken airplane

1001
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,719
with confusing uh warnings and um

1002
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,760
to and to begin dealing with that new

1003
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,679
plane design the mcas system was not

1004
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,760
unknown to pilots at the time

1005
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,359
uh and it was in fact emitted from

1006
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,399
training mod

1007
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,399
manuals so there were no relevant

1008
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,560
checklists and trainings to deal with

1009
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,079
the new mcas system

1010
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,760
so step one here is unfortunately

1011
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,079
completely omitted pilots were made to

1012
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,000
walk before they could even crawl

1013
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,839
in step two they never really really

1014
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,520
made it out of 88 before they hit the

1015
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,599
ground and step three of course was the

1016
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,918
post crash investigation and

1017
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,719
recommendations it issues which was

1018
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,320
to disable the system if it was suspect

1019
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,480
and by now um we can see some of the

1020
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,800
similarities between a security incident

1021
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,560
response for a single incident and an

1022
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,399
aviation incident

1023
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,599
um

1024
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,280
the scope is the singular incident

1025
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,720
report which is all the things that are

1026
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,040
going wrong step one is to crawl we have

1027
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,599
to quantify priority and quant and then

1028
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,280
prioritize the relevant vulnerabilities

1029
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,119
risks and efforts

1030
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,119
and then step two

1031
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,200
is to walk in the air pilots need to

1032
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,640
make sense of the data they have and

1033
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,760
figure out what they're going to do

1034
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,000
about it and security incident response

1035
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
we have to figure out what efforts are

1036
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,880
going to fix the problem and prioritize

1037
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,920
them

1038
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,520
this enables us to come up with a

1039
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,680
cohesive mitigation plan

1040
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,119
and only with these plans can we

1041
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,720
effectively execute these prioritized

1042
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,880
efforts

1043
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,640
step three would be to iterate after the

1044
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,320
incident is over so effective

1045
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
postmortems are key

1046
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,520
um

1047
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,720
ideally we are looking at these

1048
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,560
postmortems

1049
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,240
to make future incidents smoother and

1050
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,920
less painful

1051
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,480
so about six months into uh incident

1052
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,880
response leadership um pattern

1053
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,160
recognition allowed me to make a

1054
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,480
simplified workflow simplified i'm sorry

1055
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,400
it looks really complicated um but

1056
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,320
essentially this was how to handle

1057
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,760
incidents consistently and this was

1058
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,680
built from data that i had in incident

1059
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,800
reports

1060
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,079
so um

1061
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,359
the data that i had in incident

1062
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,280
resupports were specifically documented

1063
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,760
timelines and all of the detailed action

1064
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,400
items for every accepted incident in my

1065
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,280
scope

1066
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,960
so like for example every square

1067
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,560
rectangle was actually a task some of

1068
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,440
them had their own checklists and every

1069
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,359
yellow rectangle was actually who are we

1070
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,040
calling in in terms of subject matter

1071
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,079
experts

1072
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,920
um one of them i used to call in is

1073
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,800
right there and then diamonds were if

1074
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,320
then statements to trigger what's the

1075
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,040
next test task or checklist

1076
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,000
um

1077
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,160
another pattern that i recognized

1078
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,760
because i had all this aggregate data

1079
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,640
was

1080
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,560
my fellow incident manager on calls

1081
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,599
imocs were experiencing incident fatigue

1082
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,359
and the data demonstrated that we were

1083
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,760
taking on too many low-level incidents

1084
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,800
um

1085
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,720
in aggregating that data and performing

1086
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,560
a post-mortem uh we figured out that we

1087
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,800
weren't declaring incident severity soon

1088
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,560
enough at the very beginning um

1089
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,599
we changed our protocols to

1090
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,599
ensure that we determined incident

1091
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,880
severity

1092
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,160
before

1093
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,240
we decided the incident would be

1094
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,040
accepted for incident management so

1095
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,200
prevented burnout for my imocs

1096
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,160
um

1097
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,320
so we used

1098
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,800
the data available with the cvss

1099
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,880
calculator to decide what incidents were

1100
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,320
going to go to actual incident

1101
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,000
management and which

1102
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,599
incidents were going to go to vulner

1103
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,880
management where it could be

1104
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,480
self-managed

1105
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,000
this allowed us to only accept the

1106
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,839
highest priority incidents and created

1107
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,599
rules to push lower priority incidents

1108
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,280
to vulner management complete with their

1109
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,839
own post-mortem worksheet

1110
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,160
and then also i figured out how to like

1111
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,000
that most of this work fell into three

1112
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
main work streams which was remediation

1113
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,520
investigation and then our reporting

1114
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,800
obligations

1115
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
um because all of these things kind of

1116
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,079
have to start at the same time when your

1117
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,720
slas are less than 72 hours

1118
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,880
so um that was another thing that i

1119
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,119
found

1120
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,040
sometimes however even when we have

1121
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,800
followed these steps something bad might

1122
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,280
happen again

1123
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,160
so in march 2019 five months after lion

1124
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,800
air flight 610's accident another 737

1125
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,119
max 8 goes down ethiopian airlines

1126
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,680
flight 302 crashes in ethiopia

1127
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,160
so we have to look how and why

1128
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,040
did this happen again

1129
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,160
ethiopian airlines flight 302 will now

1130
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,520
require its own investigation and

1131
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,720
postmortem

1132
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,680
and

1133
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,960
when we see the same thing happening

1134
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,560
over and over again we suspect that

1135
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,599
something might be wrong in the way

1136
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,280
we're holistically investigating

1137
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,480
incidents

1138
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,240
the scope now includes two individual

1139
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,560
crashes and this is a very strong signal

1140
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,400
to audit the entire system used to run

1141
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,760
investigations

1142
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,040
you have to scrutinize multiple

1143
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,800
incidents in aggregate and not just the

1144
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,560
specifics of the incident but also the

1145
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,480
effectiveness of postmortem action items

1146
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,200
so

1147
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,560
first the individual incident what

1148
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,440
happened with flight 302.

1149
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,839
um they find a black box of the aircraft

1150
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,520
and they see in the logs that mcas was

1151
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,960
triggered and the plane starts to tilt

1152
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,240
itself down

1153
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,800
pilots turn off mcas system as trained

1154
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,839
and advised in the playbook but the

1155
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,280
outcome is not as expected

1156
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,040
pilots around the world are incensed

1157
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,800
they begin to investigate and thanks to

1158
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,079
the logs from the black box of the

1159
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,760
aircraft they are actually able to

1160
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,480
simulate the exact the exact conditions

1161
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,240
of the aircraft in training simulations

1162
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,119
in recreating flight 302 situation the

1163
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,920
mcas tilts the plane down

1164
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,760
and it turns out that in flight 302's

1165
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,839
case there was only 10 seconds to turn

1166
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,560
off mcas

1167
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,880
we've seen how many considerations

1168
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,640
pilots must make for individual

1169
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,280
checklists let alone tasks thousands of

1170
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,520
things can go wrong in the air how can

1171
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,920
one irresponsibly force a pilot to react

1172
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,359
to something in less than 10 seconds

1173
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,040
for some perspective pilots are

1174
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,920
literally trained worldwide to safely

1175
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
land airplanes when all engines have

1176
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,000
failed and let me tell you it does not

1177
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,200
tend to take 10 seconds to do that

1178
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,480
remediations from airline lion airline

1179
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,160
sorry lion air flight 610 post mortem

1180
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,400
put more pilots in an impossible

1181
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,400
situation

1182
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,680
so the prevailing theory is that mcas is

1183
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,480
actually

1184
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,280
governed by a single sensor on the max 8

1185
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,079
and usually on other planes there are

1186
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,720
actually redundant sensor inputs

1187
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,720
so the mcat sorry the max 8 lact

1188
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,160
sensor disagree logic

1189
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,480
there is no way to signal or to correct

1190
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,800
for a faulty sensor if there is a single

1191
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,800
sensor feeding that information

1192
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,599
um unfortunately the mcas

1193
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,920
put these planes in an unrecoverable

1194
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,599
state

1195
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,520
if they were not fast enough to react if

1196
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,960
the pilots were not fast enough to react

1197
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
within 10 seconds

1198
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,560
as an aside

1199
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,480
the oauth top 10

1200
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,079
top 10 vulnerabilities include something

1201
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,079
called insufficient monitoring and

1202
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,480
logging how would you know if a single

1203
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,319
sensor is failing if you don't have

1204
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,160
other sensors to compare and correlate

1205
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,839
it to

1206
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,359
how are investigators and pilots

1207
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,560
supposed to correct for this with

1208
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,839
insufficient logging and monitoring

1209
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,160
um the result of all this was that the

1210
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,839
max 8

1211
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,839
was grounded for almost two years and

1212
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:28,720
there are other theories that

1213
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,640
potentially contribute to the root cause

1214
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,720
as of today the final report for 302 is

1215
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,280
actually still pending

1216
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,319
so

1217
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,480
lion air flight 610 and ethiopian

1218
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,079
airlines flight 302 were repeat

1219
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,319
incidents but clearly required much more

1220
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,440
scrutiny

1221
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,480
when you see

1222
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,160
repeated computer or web application

1223
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,839
security incidents you end up needing to

1224
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,720
audit your entire program holistically

1225
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,400
so now the scope is all reports

1226
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,079
especially those that are duplicates or

1227
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,880
repeats of incidents that you're seeing

1228
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,800
to crawl we have to quantify our metrics

1229
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,119
in aggregate what we did how we did it

1230
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,200
why we did it who did it and the

1231
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,119
effectiveness of what we did about it

1232
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,480
after the fact what were the

1233
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,240
similarities and differences between the

1234
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,839
two investigations in the case of the

1235
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,040
max eight

1236
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,760
this data for example

1237
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,520
uh across multiple security incidents

1238
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,920
would allow you to better ascertain

1239
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,359
which factors would make your incident

1240
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,839
response program better or worse to walk

1241
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,599
we have to revisit all of our checklists

1242
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,520
and playbooks for how we handle

1243
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,760
incidents

1244
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,079
and to run we must always be improving

1245
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,680
our incident response plans it is

1246
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,839
essential to retrospect and to

1247
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,319
introspect all the views that encompass

1248
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,280
encapsulate this

1249
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,599
prior incidents and similar incidents we

1250
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,560
must post-mortem our entire methodology

1251
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,920
as well

1252
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,000
in the case of lion air

1253
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
um

1254
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,920
it was really easy to point some figure

1255
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,240
fingers at insufficient training the

1256
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,800
assumption was that if the pilots were

1257
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,640
aware of the system then the system

1258
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,160
could be turned off to prevent another

1259
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,680
cat crash

1260
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,599
in isolation it was reasonable to add

1261
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,839
some training add another playbook

1262
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,000
another checklist call it a day but the

1263
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,400
ethiopian crash deter demonstrated that

1264
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,319
blaming the pilots was not enough

1265
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:13,680
additional training was not enough to

1266
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,680
save the day pilots successfully

1267
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,000
performed the proposed playbook and did

1268
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,319
all the right things and mcas still put

1269
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,839
the plane into the ground anyway

1270
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,839
insight in hindsight um boeing's plan to

1271
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,599
require more training keep the plane

1272
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,359
flying while we were waiting for our

1273
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,880
software update was all actually

1274
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,440
approved by the faa and had disastrous

1275
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,400
results

1276
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,319
um boeing was fined 20 billion dollars

1277
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:40,480
they lost 60 billion dollars in sales

1278
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,119
and there was a lot more federal

1279
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,599
oversight as a result of this

1280
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,200
which if you

1281
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,800
are curious about these reports they're

1282
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,319
actually pretty fascinating i'll make

1283
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:55,000
these available on my twitter

1284
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,000
all of this additional oversight is a

1285
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,920
clear example of the meta analysis of

1286
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,520
incident response where a repeat

1287
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,240
incident forces people to change

1288
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,319
forces the people in charge to hold a

1289
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,560
mirror to the process and to strive for

1290
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,359
it to change better and um

1291
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,680
one can only imagine that similar mirror

1292
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,079
gazing exercises are being conducted at

1293
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,400
boeing as well

1294
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,359
um to quote uh rory kennedy who recently

1295
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,839
put out the netflix documentary downfall

1296
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,440
they kept the planes in the air banking

1297
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,800
on the hope that they'd create a fix

1298
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,079
before another plane was crushed

1299
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,000
so in summary um

1300
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,640
we've covered a lot of ground today

1301
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,960
the high level takeaway i leave you with

1302
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
we don't need to reinvent the wheel we

1303
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,880
do not need to repeat the same sad

1304
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,119
stories and we need to be able to crawl

1305
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,000
walk and run

1306
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,280
and to crawl

1307
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,560
at a bare minimum we need to know

1308
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,720
what the data is to organize it and make

1309
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,400
it quantifiable we need to be able to

1310
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,040
prioritize or our vulnerabilities risks

1311
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,119
and efforts unless we be caught without

1312
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,000
a playbook when push comes to shove

1313
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,599
in walking we need to be able to track

1314
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,520
all the data these are the individual

1315
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,040
building blocks so that we can build the

1316
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,359
context and history that we have all

1317
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,520
that we have quantified um into the

1318
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,319
format of timelines triash metrics slas

1319
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,280
and everything

1320
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,839
relevant to an

1321
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,280
incident and we should organize all of

1322
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,920
that into playbooks workflow diagrams we

1323
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,000
should review with a critical eye each

1324
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,599
incident holistically as they end

1325
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,200
and this should also

1326
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,359
improve what we provide to incident

1327
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,880
responders

1328
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,119
finally we need to be able to run to

1329
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,960
scale out our incident response programs

1330
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,040
effectiveness as a whole and so that we

1331
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,480
can plan for the future

1332
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,040
tabletop exercises that simulate

1333
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,400
incidents with people who have the most

1334
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,240
power makes a huge difference in the

1335
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,240
smoothness of an incident response so

1336
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,240
this is a callback to pilots recreating

1337
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,680
the situation in pilot training

1338
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,760
simulations

1339
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,839
um we have to learn when to say no as

1340
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,079
well to prioritize

1341
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,839
and in saying no that allows us to

1342
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,680
prioritize only the highest priority

1343
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,240
incidents with the resources available

1344
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,760
and with all of this we must continue to

1345
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,599
update our playbooks build templates for

1346
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,200
incidents and automate what we can from

1347
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,079
a holistic perspective

1348
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:12,839
oh

1349
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,520
sorry reading the same sad story over

1350
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,960
and over again can make us really

1351
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,040
unhappy and perhaps studying history

1352
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,040
should make us feel bad

1353
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,119
history gives us the context we need to

1354
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,599
learn from it the wisdom to prevent it

1355

from happening again and to give us the

1356
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,200

1357
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,960
but there's a benefit while there is a

1358
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,640
benefit in learning how to build the

1359

1360
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,520
wheel there's no need to actually

1361
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,200
reinvent it

00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,960
always remember that those who don't do

1363
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,319
not learn from history are doomed to

1364
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,880
repeat it

1365
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,079
