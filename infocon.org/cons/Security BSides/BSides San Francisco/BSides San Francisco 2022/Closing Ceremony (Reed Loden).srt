184
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,319
of work uh to put this into if you're

185
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,319
interested in becoming a volunteer just

186
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,319
even just during the event itself um

187
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,400
just stay tuned closer to the event next

188
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,120
year uh we announced things on twitter

189
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,680
and twitter's are kind of a main source

190
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,520
of information and then also you can

191
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,280
subscribe on our website to our kind of

192
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,318
newsletter as well

193
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,240
i just want to say give a major shout

194
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,599
out to all of our sponsors without our

195
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,360
sponsors we could not make this event

196
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,919
possible uh it is

197
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,080
we are we are the most expensive b-sides

198
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,319
like as far as just cost to put it on in

199
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,960
the world because it's san francisco and

200
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,039
it is ridiculously expensive to do an

201
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,720
event here um and so uh you know i just

202
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
want to give a major shout out to all of

203
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,120
our sponsors we cannot do this event uh

204
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,720
without you and especially since we try

205
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,879
very hard to keep our actual ticket cost

206
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,720
very low comparatively to what all we

207
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,879
can offer folks so i just want to say a

208
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,879
special thanks to all of our sponsors

209
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,639
especially our five leading sponsors

210
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,240
adobe app omni

211
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680

213
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,919
all of our sponsors

214
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,479
as i said earlier we do need help

215
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,720
um you know we we've had a lot of

216
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,879
staffers that have moved on because of

217
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,199
the pandemic they've moved other places

218
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,400
um some that have just been doing this

219
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,080

move on as well um so please help us

221
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,160
make future events successful um it does

222
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
require a non-durable time commitment

223
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,280
just to be very honest with you for the

224
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,599
the staff and lead positions uh if you

225
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,399
