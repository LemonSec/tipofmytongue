00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,640

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,279
here's my intro slide uh my name is eric

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,439

work lived in san francisco and now i

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,320
still work in san francisco but live in

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,079
chicago

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,920
i lead effectively what's called a

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,520
security engineering function over at

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
twilio and what that means is i'm

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
responsible for the technical security

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,559
outcomes

24
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,719
with the exception of cert

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,760
and incident response

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,320
so i want to tell you my intent up front

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,120
just so i want you to to know like what

28
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,760
i want you to get out of this talk

29
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,160
and the goals i have is to share a

30
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,399
pattern that i've used over the years to

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,400
develop a capability from

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,799
this is fine kind of dumpster fire

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,680
to

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,040
something that i feel like we can be

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,960
proud of as an org

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,080
give talks about and also blog about

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,360
and i'm actually going to do that today

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,799
specifically

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,680
with

40
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,200
a technique that we've developed for

41
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,080
vulnerability management using debt

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
so you might ask okay well why is that

43
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,640
in your intent i i want you to have or

44
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,240
enjoy this talk and i realize when i

45
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,360
look at the talks that i've really

46
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,320
enjoyed

47
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,600
they're the ones that show how the

48
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
sausage is made right so it's you could

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,400
see the cool parts but also how did you

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,759
get there

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,680
and then also teach by real world

52
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,840
examples i learned best by real world

53
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
examples and

54
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,119
also you know i want to note that

55
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,479
everyone has just a different

56
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,840
environment that they're operating in

57
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
we're solving similar problems and it's

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,159
great to see what your current state is

59
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,320
where you ended up and how you navigated

60
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,119
that environment and um selfishly i want

61
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,119
to start a conversation with you all

62
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,640
about how you handle these heart

63
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,079
problems so please feel free to ask

64
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,119
questions or if you see me in the

65
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,880
conference you have like a cool way of

66
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,320
doing vuln management please talk to me

67
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,920
or or anything really

68
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,199
i always love to hear how other people

69
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,959
are doing things

70
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,959
so how i'm going to do it uh i'm going

71
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,879
to break this pattern down into three

72
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,560
stages so you see the emoji one two

73
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,599
three

74
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,120
for each stage i'll tell you what it is

75
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,480
why it's important

76
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
what the goals are and then what that

77
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,000
story i'll tell you a story of what this

78
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,480
stage looks like in practice

79
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
i have a little mini map up here in the

80
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,519
top right just to keep track of where we

81
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,599
are so depending on what stage we're in

82
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,760
you'll see that up there and then also

83
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,680
when we're in story time you'll see the

84
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,160
little book emoji here

85
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,760
so there are three stages for this

86
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,080
pattern uh stop the bleeding and breathe

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,319
rebuilding foundation with data

88
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,120
and experimenting strategically

89
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
so let's start off a little story time

90
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
so it's 2018 i just joined a company

91
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
named segment i

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,560
have a co-worker who has a nifty name

93
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
leaf you might have seen him earlier on

94
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,239
this stage

95
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,280
and

96
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
literally my first day i think it was

97
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,920
two hours into my first day i got my

98
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
laptop i got into octa leaf that says

99
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,640
hey let's let's go into a room real

100
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
quick i'm like great he's going to tell

101
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,519
me about the program i'm going to you

102
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,959
know he's going to give me a brain dump

103
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,480
and i'm going to learn and figure out

104
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
how i can start contributing

105
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,879
no he actually said hey

106
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
i just checked the bug bounty cue and we

107
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,560
have some p1s i'm like okay one p1

108
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,400
he said no actually three that just came

109
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,280
in

110
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,000
and we just paid 16k in bounties

111
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,200
you might want to go

112
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,480
make friends with the finance people

113
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,840
because we're going to need to re-up our

114
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,360
pool

115
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,840
no problem

116
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,440
this is actually a recreation of the

117
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,840
conversation i had with leaf he said

118
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,519
welcome aboard eric

119
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,360
 rolled into town last night and we

120
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,640
have three p ones and my response was we

121
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,920
can just use the existing bull

122
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,840
management process right leaf

123
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
he looked at me vacantly

124
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,120
and

125
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,239
make sure you heard me i repeated myself

126
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,959
okay we don't have a robust management

127
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,480
process i get it

128
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,319
the program just started you have to

129
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,400
start from somewhere but maybe they had

130
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
bits and pieces of their program in

131
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,879
place

132
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,959
so i asked some questions

133
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,798
well we're all vulnerabilities ticketed

134
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,238
even the ones we weren't going to fix

135
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,639
just so we have that documented

136
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,199
nope we don't do that yet but that's a

137
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,600
good idea we should start that

138
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,840
um okay no problem do we have a standard

139
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,440
workflow for vulnerabilities i know that

140
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,240
there's like handoffs or yeah triage and

141
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,520
you hand it off to the people are going

142
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
to fix it

143
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,120
no we don't do that

144
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
currently

145
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,680
do we at least have consistent severity

146
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,440
in slas like just fields in jira

147
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,639
nope we don't have that yet

148
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,400
and i feel like i knew the answer to

149
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,080
this last question uh well what about

150
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,120
metrics

151
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,800
yeah nope we don't do that either so

152
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,560
um this is a little bit how i was

153
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
feeling uh this is fine

154
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,240
and again we have to start from

155
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
somewhere so let's start with our

156
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,720
pattern

157
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
um that's enough story for now let's go

158
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,240
to stage one

159
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,479
stop the bleeding and breathe

160
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,880
so there are two goals for the stage

161
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,800
the first one is buy time with good

162
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,759
enough

163
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,680
quote unquote good enough

164
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,639
um

165
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,440
and what does good enough mean well you

166
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,360
need to know who your customers are you

167
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,120
might say well i'm security team i don't

168
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,039
i don't have customers

169
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
i'm not customer facing that's not true

170
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,960
you do have customers

171
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,800
you develop a product right phone

172
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,720
management your capabilities

173
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,800
they should be version products that

174
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
your customers the internal customers

175
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,000
such as your developers your pms your

176
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,199
ems or product managers your executives

177
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,680
consume right and so you need to figure

178
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,520
out who they are and engage them to

179
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,680
figure out what good enough is

180
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
so remember we want to go from this

181
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,160
to this

182
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,520
we want to breathe

183
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
so let's get back to the story

184
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
we asked ourselves who are our customers

185
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
so they're the obvious ones engineering

186
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,960
they fix the volumes

187
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,440
grc they're the ones that need to ensure

188
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,199
that we have a valid process for

189
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,120
external customers and auditors to to

190
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,000
vet us and so we can get like iso 27001

191
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,840
and all of our certifications and the

192
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,560
big pain customers can can talk to us

193
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
and then there were the not so obvious

194
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,560
product managers they actually owned the

195
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,759
products that these vulnerabilities

196
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,680
existed in um

197
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,160
and leif's talk earlier today was really

198
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
talking about the partnership there and

199
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,600
why it's important

200
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,039
and then board members this one's kind

201
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,919
of obvious in retrospect about the time

202
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,120
something i didn't think about as a

203
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,639
customer but they they typically know

204
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,400
what good looks like and they want to

205
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,840
ensure their startup doesn't fall into

206
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,680
the move fast and breach stuff mode

207
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
which um i've seen a few times

208
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,520
going back to ypms again

209
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,960
this is a conversation i'm sure you've

210
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
all had if you worked in appsec or had

211
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
to triage any vulnerability so maybe

212
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,160
there's a vulnerability an activation

213
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,319
service so you go into slack and say hey

214
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,400
who owns activation service

215
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,240
engineering might say hey we do what's

216
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,520
up

217
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,039
there is a critical p1 vulnerability

218
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,080
that we need to fix can you help

219
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,319
sure thing and that fix could be one

220
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,360
hour

221
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
four hours one day it could be really

222
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,759
systemic it might take a week

223
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,479
and

224
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,360
the

225
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,520
pms might be like where are my

226
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,080
engineering resources um

227
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,440
and so we wanted to make sure that they

228
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
were part of this process from the

229
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,960
beginning

230
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,520
and then our other customers grc for

231
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
good enough what they wanted was a risk

232
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,680
exception workflow

233
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
right so we're not going to fix every

234
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
vulnerability and the ones that we do

235
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,160
not fix let's make sure that we document

236
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
that

237
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,639
and let's make sure that we have a plan

238
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,880
to remediate it eventually

239
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,879
we have image manager i'd like to see

240
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,720
vulnerabilities related to my team so we

241
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,919
always talk about we want that single

242
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,479
pane of glass when we talk to vendors

243
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,240
our customers internally want that too

244
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,639
they don't care necessarily to see every

245
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,720
vulnerability that exists within segment

246
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,039
they want to see what they own and what

247
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,879
they have to do so that they can bake it

248
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,400
into their sprint

249
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,000
and then board members just like all

250
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,440
executives they love metrics and

251
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,879
reporting

252
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,319
and so we wanted to make sure that we

253
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,520
had that

254
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,160
so this is where we ended up for v1 you

255
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,440
can see here

256
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
something that's pretty unique we add

257
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,879
product triage actually as the first

258
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,919
step

259
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,919
and that's because our product teams

260
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,000
they manage bugs for their product and

261
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
when we find vulnerabilities and

262
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,960
hopefully i don't

263
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,319
get in trouble for saying this but we

264
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,919
kind of look at them as a class of a

265
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,039
class of a bug right and so

266
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,320
when we find something let's say in

267
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,039
personas we have it go to the personas

268
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,880
pm to help make a decision if they're

269
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,599
going to fix it or not and if they don't

270
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,080
it goes down the risk acceptance flow

271
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,200
here you can see the grc person's happy

272
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,519
and then metrics nothing fancy like we

273
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,040
didn't need to knock it out of the park

274
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
jira i mean it's not the

275
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,680
coolest tool in the world um i mean i

276
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,000
disagree but uh for a lot of people it's

277
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,720
not the uh the most interesting or or

278
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
people eyes might glaze over when they

279
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,600
look at jira dashboards but they

280
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,080
actually do they're pretty

281
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
flexible and you can get pretty far and

282
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,560
get good enough

283
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,720
and so here we have for example

284
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
vulnerabilities by vrt which if you're

285
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
not familiar with vrt it's a bug crowd

286
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,839
vulnerability rating taxonomy something

287
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,839
that we adopted pretty early so that we

288
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,399
can see how our bugs our vulnerabilities

289
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,399
were broken down and see where we might

290
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,760
needed to

291
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,839
spend some time and energy in the appsec

292
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,519
program to eliminate that vulnerability

293
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,480
class

294
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,399
and then you can't see it here and we'll

295
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,920
talk about a little bit more later but

296
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,839
we also had breach slas by a product

297
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,680
manager and that's like that single pane

298
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
of glass for them

299
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,160
all right enough story time for now

300
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,320
how do we do for stage one buy time with

301
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
good enough identify and engage our

302
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,120
customers we we did both of those so

303
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
we're feeling pretty chill

304
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,880
we can maybe take that now that we have

305
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,760
time

306
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,519
we can maybe take that extra peloton

307
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,320
class and and and relax a little bit and

308
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,120
move on to stage two so stage two is

309
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,480
rebuilding the foundation with data

310
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,920
so the first thing you want to do is

311
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,480
decide if good enough is good enough for

312
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,000
now

313
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,320
and the reason why that's important is

314
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,399
because especially in a startup you have

315
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,120
a lot of things to do to get started

316
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,360
our vulnerability management program v1

317
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,760
was good enough we had an sdlc to build

318
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,839
we had design reviews to figure out we

319
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,760
had general security metrics to figure

320
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,640
out

321
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,839
and so

322
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,880
that's

323
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,560
why that's very important

324
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,120
and then also we want to make sure that

325
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,880
when we do design v2 let's make sure

326
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,760
that we

327
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
do it with our customers transparently

328
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
and using data from v1

329
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,600
so let's go back to the story

330
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,519
like i said earlier good enough was good

331
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,320
enough for now and so what we did was

332
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,040
actually revisited in a couple years so

333
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,720
what year is it it's 2020 now so 2018 to

334
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,880
2020.

335
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,800
so looking at the data from v1 we had

336
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,920
our customers

337
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,160
customer stories that is data it's maybe

338
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,600
a little bit more qualitative but that's

339
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,920
fine we had our metrics more on the

340
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,160
quantitative side

341
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,560
and then importantly your team

342
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,399
you should always consider what inputs

343
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,320
from your team like no one wants to work

344
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
on a process that has a ton of toil

345
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,240
it could burn out your engineers and

346
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,600
that puts you in the worst place from a

347
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,120
security perspective

348
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,640
because now you have to hire and all the

349
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,320
opportunity costs that that goes with

350
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,440
that

351
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,120
and so what we did is we wrote our

352
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,040
learnings in the doc

353
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,480
and i want to go through the top three

354
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,680
learnings

355
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,600
right now so the key learning

356
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
for number one that we had was people

357
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,200
need the system's workflow to be

358
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,040
intuitive

359
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,880
number of states should be minimized

360
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,040
technical jargon even security technical

361
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
jargon can be distracting and confusing

362
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,240
especially for folks that aren't in the

363
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,200
security space and so what we did for v2

364
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,399
is we

365
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,680
this is our new

366
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,519
workflow to the right you can see

367
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,279
there's one less state

368
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,839
also our volun management process or i'm

369
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
sorry the risk acceptance process got

370
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,079
translated into a due date extension

371
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,360
because people understand due date

372
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,959
extension better than they understand

373
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,600
temporary risk acceptance and so

374
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,279
this was just a lot easier for people to

375
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,800
navigate so if they have a vulnerability

376
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,639
that's due they can't make that due date

377
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,480
they can extend it obviously there's

378
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,160
approvals and things like that required

379
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,279
key learning number two notifications

380
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,120
need to be improved and actionable so

381
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,560
surprise factors should be minimized at

382
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,639
all costs

383
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,959
our customers are the ones that need to

384
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,560
navigate this process and they don't

385
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,600
know how

386
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,399
or why they have vulnerabilities and and

387
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,040
they you know show up in some report to

388
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,800
their boss it's not going to be great

389
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
they're going to potentially get

390
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,360
defensive

391
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,959
and then also actionable instruction

392
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,480
should be readily present in the process

393
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,240
itself

394
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,920
so what this looks like for us we

395
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,760
leveraged email quite a bit

396
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,600
so when you get a new vulnerability you

397
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
get an email notification

398
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
tells you what the due date is

399
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,519
the details the metadata that you need

400
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,720
and then simple instructions are right

401
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,320
here they don't need to go read a primer

402
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,480
standard it's right in the process

403
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,519
itself and ideally very few steps

404
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,079
and then if you have a volume due soon

405
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,360
we sometimes bring in the department

406
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,480
leads depending on how close the

407
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,240
vulnerability is due

408
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,959
again consistent format where possible

409
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,959
and then simple instructions

410
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,399
and then when there's a due date

411
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,959
extension aka accepting risk

412
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,519
this is what the approver sees they see

413
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,200
the all the information in one spot and

414
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,720
sometimes this is executives right they

415
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
live in email so they want to see

416
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,959
what the justification is

417
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,279
how do they feel comfortable accepting

418
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,560
this risk and then if they have

419
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,720
questions

420
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,800
they can always reply and it brings in

421
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,480
the security team and also brings in the

422
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
person that asked for the exception and

423
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
of course this gets reflected back into

424
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,959
jira which is what we were using so for

425
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,839
auditing purposes

426
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,120
key learning three of three

427
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,600
so attribution should be flexibly tied

428
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
to the org chart so accountable

429
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
attribution should not be hard to

430
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,720
maintain i i'll go into more detail

431
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,399
about this but the team field

432
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,519
was

433
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,880
very hard to maintain teams were

434
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,120
disappearing teams were appearing

435
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,240
we had

436
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,600
vulnerabilities that had no owner

437
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,160
because that team disappeared and so

438
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,079
there was a lot of toil there and then

439
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,600
attribution should allow you to roll up

440
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,440
metrics and i'll go into more detail

441
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
here in a second

442
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,560
so let's talk about work structure

443
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,480
change you have the root of your orgs is

444
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,399
where the ceo typically sits

445
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,600
and then you have a one-to-many

446
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,440
relationship with your departments and

447
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,720
this is it could be departments

448
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,680
divisions i it's all semantics but um

449
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,399
for us it's g a gtm r d this is like

450
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,399
where you're cto this is where your ceo

451
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,440
might sit or your people officer or your

452
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,880
revenue officer

453
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,480
then there's a one-to-many relationship

454
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,880
with maybe macro teams or divisions

455
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,000
underneath

456
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,199
and then there's a one-to-many

457
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,880
relationship with teams at the bottom so

458
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,120
our v1 team field was just it was

459
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,880
anchored at the bottom and like i said

460
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,040
there was a ton of toil

461
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,199
and obvious in retrospect but the rate

462
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,519
of change increases as you move down

463
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,320
um this or chart and so

464
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
the team changes all the time

465
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,279
whereas the org and department ideally

466
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,639
hopefully

467
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,839
is pretty much stable

468
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,519
and so

469
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,760
this was the sweet spot for us we ended

470
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,880
up actually anchoring all of our

471
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
vulnerabilities to the division level

472
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,800
um and we actually tied them into the

473
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,120
department as well and

474
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,279
uh that was required and teams were kind

475
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,600
of optional they they weren't required

476
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,079
and um if they let's say the division

477
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,720
lead wanted that last mile attribution

478
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
say okay which team owns this they can

479
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,839
do it themselves it seemed to work

480
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,320
pretty well that way

481
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
and then the other thing that we can do

482
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,759
when you start tying the vulnerabilities

483
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,360
to the org chart you can start doing

484
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,600
interesting things such as roll up and

485
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,519
you can enable competition

486
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,720
so

487
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,600
imagine personas at the division level

488
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,560
they want to see how their

489
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
vulnerabilities break down

490
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,880
uh you can see oh sorry jumped ahead

491
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,839
there

492
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,759
this is v1 this is where we were limited

493
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,160
to so we could only see

494
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,880
team level breached sla metrics which

495
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,120
was fine but i mentioned it introduced a

496
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,040
lot of toil and you couldn't really roll

497
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,639
these up cleanly

498
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,079
but when you anchor it to the

499
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,680
organization you can start to roll them

500
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
up so in this case you can say presonus

501
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,839
has six breached slas and you can see

502
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,279
protocols has 25 data plane has zero

503
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,959
and so the department lead in this case

504
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,920
the cto might be asking or responsible

505
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,000
to the ceo says yeah we have 31 breach

506
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600
slas in our org

507
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,759
i want to get that down to zero who do i

508
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,600
need to go talk to let me look at the

509
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,320
metrics and you can see six were from

510
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,839
personas

511
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,680
zero we're from data plane a plus

512
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,800
student here

513
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,839
and uh 25 were from protocols shame

514
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,519
shame shame so

515
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,240
we um what this does is it enables

516
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
competition you don't want to be the

517
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,600
director or the team that has 25 when

518
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,560
your peer down the hall has zero

519
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,120
it's kind of inexcusable or hard to

520
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,240
explain to your boss when other your

521
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,959
peers are doing it as well

522
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,720
so this is what the dashboard looked

523
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,679
like

524
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,839
you'd see that we have the department

525
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,679
and then the if you wanted to zoom in

526
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,559
you can go into the individual

527
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,679
pillars or divisions

528
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,280
and then so going back to one of the

529
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,799
things that we need to do is design this

530
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,160
with our customers so those learnings

531
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,400
that i put together

532
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,440
we actually

533
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,799
brought the pms in we brought the

534
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,760
executives in they were engaged they

535
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,360
were interacting they were getting hyped

536
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,200
which is great to see we also created

537
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,880
user stories um and so like for example

538
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,559
the executive what you want to see i

539
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,600
want to be able to see all breach

540
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,840
vulnerabilities by function

541
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
and furthermore i want commentary and

542
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,640
from owners and on breach status and why

543
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,039
then why do you want that so i can

544
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,039
ensure vulnerabilities within my org are

545
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,200
being remediated in a timely fashion and

546
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,960
then you have your flow and we do this

547
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
for all the different customers or

548
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,039
actors in our org or in for the

549
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,520
vulnerability management system

550
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,960
created mock-ups

551
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,039
just so that we could get approval from

552
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,480
them to to make sure that this made

553
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,200
sense and was easy for them to consume

554
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,520
we had strong reviews uh at the end of

555
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,280
the day and then when the process did

556
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,480
launch about

557
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
two years or a year and a half later

558
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,000
tito who is our chief development

559
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
product officer uh mentioned that this

560
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
was one of the best operational

561
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,880
processes that we have at segment and we

562
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,679
actually started rolling this out to um

563
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,760
betterment so like sev betterments like

564
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,400
sub one sub two sub three um you will

565
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,120
have an incident a postmortem you'll

566
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
have um betterments that come out of

567
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,880
that they were actually leveraging a lot

568
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,440
of the the system as well

569
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,520
all right enough story for now how do we

570
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,400
do

571
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,960
stage two

572
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
all right let's get to the fun part

573
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,919
experimenting strategically so there's

574
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,280
three parts here

575
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,760
identify a good problem space using v2

576
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,200
data

577
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,960
leverage prior art

578
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,440
in this industry or json ones like sre

579
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,960
for example

580
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
and experiment and share your

581
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,799
results early to see if there's traction

582
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,960
so let's go back to the story

583
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,400
back to our customers all right we're

584
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,840
looking at all this again

585
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
some problems we observed

586
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,160
so parts of the org had vastly different

587
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,799
risk appetites so personas may be very

588
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,720
thoughtful anytime they needed to do an

589
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,039
extension or accept a risk they would

590
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,400
make sure that they would only come back

591
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,240
to the well once

592
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,000
and ensure that they had allocation for

593
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,480
that particular work to be done in their

594
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,039
roadmap whereas maybe data processing

595
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,559
again these are fake

596
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,919
pillars i'm not trying to call them out

597
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,360
data processing was a lot more

598
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,720
rubber stamp happy to extend risks

599
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
and then we also realized as extensions

600
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,600
grew

601
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,440
breached sla metric became less

602
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,640
meaningful so sure data processing might

603
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
have zero breach slas but they might

604
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,720
have a thousand open volumes

605
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
and so what does a breach sla mean at

606
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,559
this point

607
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,000
if they have a ton of exceptions and

608
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,240
then lots of toil and helping teams with

609
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,919
prioritization like we love to work with

610
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,159
our engineering partners but they always

611
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,159
were asking us okay how do we prioritize

612
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,240
these it's not always as simple as we

613
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,880
need to do p1 p2 p3 burn down for your

614
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,159
vulnerabilities

615
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,679
they were looking for a little bit more

616
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,840
uh hand crafting and artisanal

617
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,120
prioritization which is great but it

618
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,440
takes a lot of time

619
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,480
so

620
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,679
we wanted to figure out what our problem

621
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,440
space was and we needed to define it so

622
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,039
could we come up

623
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,159
with a metric that was more meaningful

624
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,720
than a breach sla that

625
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
enabled different parts

626
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,000
of the org to have different risk

627
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,919
appetites

628
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,919
to ensure that those risk appetites were

629
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,919
in a healthy range

630
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,520
and then could provide a stronger

631
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,080
prioritization beyond severity

632
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,400
so we want to start looking at different

633
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,480
industries leveraging different prior

634
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,280
art

635
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,320
and

636
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,240
i don't know if you folks are familiar

637
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,720
but there's this amazing book from

638
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,799
google that's free the site reliability

639
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,880
engineering book

640
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,559
and you might ask okay why do you care

641
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,559
about sre

642
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,760
and

643
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,159
what i say is that they are very similar

644
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,080
to what we do they take customer facing

645
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,919
risks and impact they translate them

646
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,880
into ttps like tools

647
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,320
concepts like sli's slos slas and they

648
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080
hold the business accountable right they

649
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
speak to the engineers they typically

650
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,520
are the most advanced engineers in the

651
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,679
org that i've seen

652
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,679
and so i thought they had a lot of great

653
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,240
learnings and specifically chapter three

654
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,440
and you can see where i got the title

655
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,080
this talk mostly inspired from

656
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,480
is around embracing risk and the intro

657
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,960
talks about extreme reliability comes at

658
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,640
a cost and that makes sense right we

659
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,440
can't

660
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,480
have

661
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,440
a perfectly secure system

662
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,679
and just like in sre you can't have a

663
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,000
perfectly reliable system because it

664
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
costs too much money

665
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,960
and gene spafford from purdue um

666
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,159
mentioned

667
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,240
the only system which is truly secure is

668
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,400
one is switched off

669
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,240
and unplugged locked in the titanium

670
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,600
line safe

671
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,280
buried in a concrete bunker is

672
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,200
surrounded by nerve gas and very highly

673
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,280
paid armed guards

674
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,360
and even then i wouldn't stick my life

675
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,400
on it so we have to manage risk we have

676
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,240
to have it within our business and

677
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,400
that's fine because if we didn't we

678
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,080
wouldn't have a product

679
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,600
so going back to

680
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
the sre book

681
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,360
in this chapter they also mentioned what

682
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,760
their focus is is to seek a balance of

683
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,640
risk

684
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,320
of unavailability with the goals of

685
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,400
rapid innovation so how i looked at that

686
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,840
was can we

687
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,919
balance security risk and balance it

688
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,039
with like the need to ship product

689
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,960
and then there was a i'm sure a lot of

690
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,480
you are familiar with this part which is

691
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,120
they talk about error budgets which

692
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,320
um

693
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,240
basically this metric you have two

694
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,320
opposing incentives you have the product

695
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,760
team that wants to ship quicker and you

696
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,360
have the reliability team that wants to

697
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,039
make sure that services are reliable

698
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,640
sometimes those incentives aren't

699
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,000
aligned so they they wanted to come up

700
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,240
with a metric that allowed

701
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,400
reduce the friction between those two

702
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,440
competing

703
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,480
actors

704
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,440
and so what this looks like in practice

705
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,640
um

706
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,720
product manager defines an slo so think

707
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,679
of this like up time per quarter

708
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,440
slo is measured by initial third parties

709
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,880
so the monitoring system try to

710
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,640
eliminate bias

711
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,840
service goes down for a period of time

712
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,600
that eats up that up time per quarter

713
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,080
budget and then if that budget is

714
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,000
exceeded new releases are halted and

715
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,720
reliability work is prioritized

716
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,480
so some takeaways again perfect

717
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,000
reliability

718
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,240
reliable systems are not the goal

719
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
we need to find a balance and then air

720
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,559
budgets allow teams to align unclear and

721
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,320
objective metric per product

722
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,640
so i was thinking about this um well we

723
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,000
were thinking about this sorry uh it's

724
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200
not just me

725
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,000
uh and we realized that due date

726
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,080
extension temporary risk acceptance we

727
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,200
were trying to figure out if there is a

728
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,080
way

729
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,240
to um with budgets we were thinking

730
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,840
about currency

731
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,679
and we're like okay maybe

732
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,919
we can think about debt debt is a form

733
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,760
of currency right and so we were

734
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,080
thinking um maybe every time you do an

735
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,440
extension you're kind of telling the

736
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,000
business hey i can't fix this right now

737
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,480
but i promise to to fix it in the future

738
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,919
and therefore you're taking on technical

739
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,480
debt or security debt and we were

740
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,400
wondering okay can we make this debt can

741
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,320
we manage it can we budget it per

742
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,559
department

743
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,520
and um if each extension is debt what's

744
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,279
what are the interest rates right and so

745
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,039
the requirements for that we need to

746
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,640
make sure that we discourage people from

747
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,039
taking out egregious loans

748
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,520
or egregious debts so interest rates

749
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,799
should be higher for more severe

750
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,080
vulnerabilities

751
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,240
the highest interest rates or loans

752
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,679
should be pre-approved at the right

753
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:46,559
level

754
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,240
of authority in the business and then

755
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
interest rates should be intuitive

756
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,880
and we actually realize our sla to

757
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,960
approval mapping and sla time and

758
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,679
severity this all kind of came together

759
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,760
and something that we can leverage so we

760
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,000
we sat down and and we

761
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,520
figured out okay what would a debt

762
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,440
metric look like

763
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,400
and

764
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,240
here it is this is what we use today

765
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,000
it's it's the current date minus the

766
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,440
original due date

767
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,279
divided by sla i know this is a very

768
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,279
simple formula but that's by design

769
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,120
because people look at this as actually

770
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,760
elapsed sla periods that's easy to grok

771
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,000
executives for them to understand that

772
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,080
and that's who you need to convince

773
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,279
i'm not saying it's perfect we're still

774
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,360
working on how to make sure people can

775
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,799
fully understand it but we didn't want

776
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,640
to add a bunch of opaque factors into

777
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,799
this debt where people can't um

778
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,400
understand it and

779
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,960
maybe immediately push back on it so

780
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,400
this is what

781
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,919
an example would look like so let's say

782
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,520
a debt value for a vulnerability that's

783
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,360
six months overdue so keep in mind this

784
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,640
is after the sla has elapsed um let's

785
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,720
say it was june 30th

786
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,960
and it was due on jan 1st it's 180 days

787
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,919
overdue

788
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,880
sla for p3 is 30 days and then it's six

789
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,039
elapsed sla periods it's just our unit i

790
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,240
don't know i

791
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,159
forgive me physicists in in the room

792
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,760
hopefully i didn't offend

793
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,960
um

794
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,600
okay so let's go through an example

795
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
vulnerability is identified in personas

796
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,640
p3 severity 30 days to fix due date is

797
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,200
on 101 2022

798
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,400
the team believes there is a more

799
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,480
important risk to address first

800
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,559
in q1 therefore they extend the due date

801
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,360
until 4 15 20 22.

802
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,559
the director of that department is

803
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,240
notified they sign off you saw the

804
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,159
notification earlier

805
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,360
same system

806
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,039
and then the vulnerability begins to

807
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,320
generate technical security debt so

808
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,799
in this case 104 days over 30 days that

809
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,960
gives us about 3.5 elapsed sla periods

810
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
before the end

811
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,440
of

812
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,960
um or when that vulnerability is now due

813
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,720
so what can you do with this metric like

814
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,159
okay cool you have a number but we can

815
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,520
start doing

816
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
org wide roll-ups we can say hey what is

817
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,440
the debt look like for segment as a

818
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,000
whole how does that break down

819
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,840
within departments

820
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,240
in this case we're looking at the median

821
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,760
versus the average because the outliers

822
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,919
were throwing things off and so we ended

823
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,400
up looking at just the median debt

824
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,200
again these numbers are fake um but this

825
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,279
is a real system that we leverage you

826
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,200
can also look at how

827
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,320
debt is managed at the division level um

828
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,080
so here in this case on the left side

829
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,520
you're seeing the total debt that

830
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,760
presonus has which is quite high

831
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,200
however

832
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,200
that debt is

833
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,679
on the i'm sorry the median pillar debt

834
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,000
on the right side is actually fairly low

835
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,720
so

836
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,960
that to me could signify that yes they

837
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,159
have a lot of open vulnerabilities but

838
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,559
they are paying them down fairly

839
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,240
regularly whereas

840
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,840
stream processing here maybe has a

841
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,600
smaller surface area

842
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,760
so less debt overall

843
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,159
but they aren't paying it down and that

844
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,000
to me is a an area that i would probably

845
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,600
spike into especially if you look at the

846
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,399
peers here that have like 18 16

847
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,080
14 so it might be an area of interest

848
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,399
you can also see how debt breaks down by

849
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,279
severity so maybe certain teams might be

850
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,919
more interested in p3 p2 or p1s and they

851
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,679
don't care about p4 p5 and that might be

852
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,279
fine

853
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,960
you could also see oh in this case

854
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,120
stream processing

855
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,520
they have a lot of vulnerabilities at

856
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,039
the p2 phase that are accruing a lot of

857
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,679
debt so again we might want to look

858
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,039
closer here

859
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,840
um total debt this one i haven't found

860
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,960
an interesting

861
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
value or use case of this so i'm just

862
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,559
going to skip it

863
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,799
i could not get the dashboard i was i

864
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,960
was literally editing the html in in

865
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,120
snowflake i can't for some reason for

866
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,279
like list views i can't do that there so

867
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,600
i just copied it over to a spreadsheet

868
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,559
but

869
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,679
what this is showing that we we have the

870
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,919
ability to look at the highest loans

871
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,640
taking in the last day week or month

872
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,440
and we really we realized that

873
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,360
it's not always the p1s or p2s you have

874
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,039
to worry about

875
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,799
sometimes it's the things like p3s right

876
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,279
if you push a p3 for a year that's a lot

877
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,200
more egregious in my opinion than maybe

878
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,679
a p1 for a couple days and so when you

879
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,600
have these vulnerabilities

880
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,000
listed or oriented this way you can

881
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,760
maybe adjust your focus on the ones that

882
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,399
maybe are more concerning

883
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,240
we also um have our uh within all of

884
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,200
twilio or segment soon to be twilio we

885
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,440
have all our vulnerabilities um in jira

886
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,640
then we have

887
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,200
uh the apps lapse sla periods associated

888
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,600
with them so we can actually generate a

889
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,720
list of our most egregious or or our top

890
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,039
10 security debt items and it actually

891
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,320
goes through all of our vulnerabilities

892
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,520
so it's like the top 250 or whatever

893
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,399
or yeah it's arbitrary

894
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,679
we also have a top 10 debt review so

895
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,960
this is something where we invite

896
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
executives pillar leads or department

897
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,039
leads security leadership and what we do

898
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,720
is we get in a room we talk about the

899
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,760
top 10

900
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,880
vulnerabilities and we try to get an

901
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,279
understanding of will the due date be

902
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,120
met like this is how much debt it

903
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,360
already has are there blockers how can

904
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,039
we eliminate this and sometimes they

905
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,799
actually push back they say hey this

906
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,480
severity is too high and that's fine

907
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,640
that's a good outcome we know that

908
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,000
sometimes there's a little bit of an art

909
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
and science to severity and

910
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
while i wish we could be very scientific

911
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,279
there it's not

912
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,240
reality and so um we sometimes litigate

913
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,840
and go back and forth until we come up

914
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,159
with a severity that we feel is about

915
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,120
correct

916
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,720
and uh down here in the bottom right is

917
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,480
a little bit of a promotion from albert

918
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,200
who is a really great vp of avenge um at

919
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,960
twilio and he he mentioned it was like

920
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,039
one of his favorite meetings uh of the

921
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,279
year so it was great to see that our vps

922
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,200
of anger engaged

923
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,559
but what's the value of this metric

924
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,000
right it's easy to understand there's no

925
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,799
hidden factors right elapsed slas

926
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,120
directly tied to severity so it's not

927
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,720
too much of a jump from where you are

928
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,960
with your current vulnerability program

929
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,039
allows for aggregation and importantly

930
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,399
budgets and we'll talk about that in a

931
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,840
second and better prioritization than um

932
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,240
severity alone

933
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,960
so

934
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,600
looking forward we're scaling up uh and

935
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
and we actually are doing this at twilio

936
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,120
julio is a very large company relative

937
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,679
to segment and this is one of the top

938
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,440
five metrics we share with executives

939
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,080
we're iterating on it to get it to where

940
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,679
maybe we feel like it's it's actionable

941
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,760
and where it needs to be

942
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,559
but we have a spreadsheet that we share

943
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,120
and you can see here there is a budget

944
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,720
per bu so a target so in this case

945
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,440
let's say this was segment and

946
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
we have a target of 12 well if you

947
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,960
recall the dashboard earlier was like

948
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
12.5

949
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,399
in this case then maybe it's not in such

950
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,640
a good spot so we would want to push on

951
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,799
them to maybe halt or slow down their

952
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,960
development of new features and work on

953
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,399
security

954
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,120
betterments and then also

955
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,840
just because we have that hierarchy

956
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
we can also attribute to products

957
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,679
individually as well so product one

958
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,360
product two product three how do they

959
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,919
contribute to that um that four point

960
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,760
eight score

961
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,880
and then we're also thinking about

962
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,600
budget enforcement and ci so

963
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,919
if we know repo belongs to a particular

964
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,919
team they let's say it's a activation

965
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,120
service

966
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,039
and we want to help kind of bake this

967
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,640
and push it left as far as possible

968
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,360
maybe we can have a github check that

969
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,559
says hey you're approaching your

970
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,559
division budget you're currently at 12

971
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,320
budget is 13.

972
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,679
maybe you should start fixing some of

973
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:18,799
your vulnerabilities because otherwise

974
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,720
we might block you soon

975
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,360
and again this budget is set by the the

976
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,960
pm or product manager and so or the the

977
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,799
the gm uh the general manager of that

978
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,640
particular part of the business so they

979
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,880
are uh incentivized to keep this down

980
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,519
this isn't just security saying this

981
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,399
um

982
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,440
and then

983
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,519
this this idea is a little uh bonkers

984
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,519
but uh we are trying to figure out maybe

985
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,519
calibrating costs with incidents and

986
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,519
calibrating um

987
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,240
that cost to debt budget so or to debt

988
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,480
so i'll go through an example but for

989
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,399
each vulnerability that materializes

990
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,720
into a security incident could you

991
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,360
calculate the cost of that incident

992
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,240
maybe engineering time to resolve

993
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,399
business loss

994
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,200
and then divide by debt score very very

995
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,840
simple um so in this case let's say

996
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,200
vulnerability with a death score of 30

997
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,640
resulted in an incident that cost the

998
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,600
business

999
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,279
2 million dollars

1000
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,200
can you divide this and say oh well

1001
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,519
maybe one debt point is 100k

1002
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,480
and so

1003
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,320
let's say a new division

1004
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,720
has an aggregate debt of 50 then they're

1005
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,480
carrying 5 million of potential security

1006
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,960
debt again this idea might be bonkers

1007
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,000
but i do feel like there's something

1008
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,399
here to help us do more of an apples to

1009
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,480
apples comparison between

1010
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
future work that it's really easy to

1011
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,679
understand what revenue that can bring

1012
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,679
in versus the security work which is

1013
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,200
always a

1014
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,440
a couple steps away from

1015
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,760
revenue so

1016
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,600
and then some miscellaneous ideas we're

1017
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,519
thinking about credit scores so maybe

1018
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,640
teams are really good at paying off

1019
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,799
their debt or keeping their debt low

1020
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,320
maybe we have less restrictions on them

1021
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,240
taking onset debt

1022
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,039
and then also this can be applied to any

1023
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,519
tech debt that has severity in sla so

1024
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,159
set betterments and so we did present

1025
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,320
this to our sev team there was a lot of

1026
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,960
interest follow up on that

1027
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,199
so how do we do on stage three goals

1028
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,520
uh we hit all three of these

1029
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,800
and um

1030
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,760
that's it we're hiring come work with me

1031
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,359
um thank you

1032
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,960
and dm me on linkedin also check out

1033
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,719
jeevan's talk

1034
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,598
3 30 in this room

1035
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,000
now i'll take your questions

1036
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,839
how do i do on time

1037
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,359
okay good

1038
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,158
yes

1039
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,158
uh so within segment the

1040
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,960
oh oh yeah good idea um how was it

1041
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,760
received across the org so at segment uh

1042
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,359
the chief development product officer

1043
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,119
tito thought it was great he thought it

1044
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,239
was um

1045
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,480
you know one of the most most mature uh

1046
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
processes he's seen for operational work

1047
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,480
and betterments and and burning down

1048
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,800
technical debt on the the twilio side

1049
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,680
we're still like iterating on it um i'll

1050
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,280
be honest like the first iteration was a

1051
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,200
little they were like but if i'm fixing

1052
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
my vulnerabilities then i have a low

1053
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,960
debt like how are we accounting for

1054
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,240
maybe like burn down of debt like uh so

1055
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,720
we're we're iterating on different types

1056
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,240
of ways of looking at the debt itself

1057
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,400
versus just the median so like almost

1058
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,920
like a cash flow like yeah maybe you

1059
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,040
have a lot of debt coming in but you

1060
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,720
have a lot of debt being burned down can

1061
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,640
we like kind of show that

1062
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,560
type of metric as well it's it's going

1063
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,760
to be a process right it's going to be

1064
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,320
v4 right or v3 so that's fine

1065
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,960
overall

1066
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,640
yes

1067
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,079
uh yeah the process of basically rolling

1068
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,440
this out well if you have severity

1069
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,960
and that's actually why i did this talk

1070
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,000
is just kind of show you where we

1071
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,680
started where we had nothing but and

1072
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,599
like that whole process was have

1073
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,520
severity um

1074
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,880
if you have vulnerabilities and what we

1075
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,480
do is actually we take

1076
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,280
um

1077
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,920
for us we really start debt with p3 or

1078
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,760
higher because that's where most people

1079
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,520
care for now and then as we get more

1080
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,240
mature we can start including p4 p5 and

1081
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,079
that that formula that i put up there

1082
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,560
should you throw that into

1083
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,200
a spreadsheet or you can use snowflake

1084
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,920
or however your etl and your jira data

1085
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,599
it's pretty pretty trivial like query

1086
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,960
that you can make and and you can always

1087
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,280
tweak um that formula to whatever

1088
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,200
resonates within your work but yeah so

1089
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,800
we're doing that at twilio right now and

1090
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,400
how we're starting is we're starting

1091
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,960
with our top vulnerabilities that we've

1092
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,480
seen in that business we're tagging them

1093
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,760
and those get

1094
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,480
counted towards that that debt metric

1095
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,400
we're not looking at p5s or p4s just

1096
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,760
because it's too noisy right now we need

1097
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,000
to get people used to this metric before

1098
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,839
we start really going all in on it yes

1099
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,960
yeah so the question is um if teams push

1100
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,920
back on the severity um how do you how

1101
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,560
do you manage that um and so what we do

1102
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,640
is i mean we discuss right we try to

1103
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,000
come out of the room like on agreement

1104
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,640
we actually lean a lot on cwss score

1105
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,720
like it's a calculator that we have that

1106
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,200
you even created that allows us to

1107
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,920
generate kind of a ideally an unbiased

1108
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,000
metric

1109
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,079
but some things that we do actually is

1110
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,599
say hey is there any compensating

1111
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,440
controls that will lower

1112
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,119
this debt which will lower the interest

1113
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,119
rate so if you drop it down from a p1 to

1114
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,359
p3 with a compensating control now

1115
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,800
you're not accruing a point every day

1116
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,960
you're occurring a point every 30 days

1117
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,480
and so

1118
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,839
when that debt for that particular

1119
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,359
vulnerability gets recalculated

1120
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,200
typically drops off like especially the

1121
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,920
top 10 but maybe the top 20 top 30 so

1122
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,160
it's not as much of a big deal and

1123
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,440
that's that's kind of the outcome we

1124
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,359
want right we want them to put

1125
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,359
compensating controls in place and if we

1126
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,720
can't fix the vulnerability right away

1127
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,520
then

1128
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,920
we should we should um

1129
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,520
i guess

1130
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,280
reward them for for putting that

1131
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,320
compensating control in place

1132
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,320
yes

1133
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,880
yeah um that is something i hope maybe

1134
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,839
in a year or two oh i'm sorry

1135
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,760
yeah so the question is combining with

1136
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,680
other types of technical debt

1137
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,920
um and yes it is something that i'm very

1138
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,240
interested in because if you can

1139
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,880
i'm pretty big in like dx or ux for our

1140
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,960
engineers because the processes that are

1141
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,280
usable or ones that people are going in

1142
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,119
to to to actually have the most impact

1143
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,920
on the business and so if we can take

1144
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,000
um and we want that single pane of glass

1145
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,520
if they have instant betterments they

1146
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,359
have vulnerability betterments they have

1147
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,320
i don't know any other type of

1148
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,400
betterment if we can put that all into

1149
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,800
one spot and ideally even have like

1150
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,960
similar potentially denominators and

1151
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,400
interest rates so it just makes things a

1152
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,720
lot easier you can start to rationalize

1153
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,520
and plan better as an organization on

1154
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,119
what you should be burning down and and

1155
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,359
why so yes definitely something that i

1156
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,880
would hope to see in maybe a year or two

1157
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,720
and that's why i presented it to we have

1158
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,520
like an sre meeting um that has like

1159
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,680
everyone in twilio that's sre and ops

1160
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,760
related and i presented this and um

1161
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,599
there was a decent amount of interest

1162
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,599
and follow-up from that so hopefully

1163
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,919
yes

1164
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,359
so the question is how do these

1165
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,040
vulnerabilities actually repeat it one

1166
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,200
more time

1167
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,839
yeah that's a really great question so

1168
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,839
the question is um if you have a

1169
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,280
vulnerability in like a common component

1170
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
so let's say like your infrastructure

1171
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,640
team has a vulnerability and that debt

1172
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,079
impacts and

1173
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,319
i guess a team higher up on the stack

1174
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,359
how does that translate

1175
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,280
we don't really have a good answer for

1176
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,119
that today like one thing that we were

1177
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,560
thinking about there which is um

1178
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,880
so let's say we have a a systemic issue

1179
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,839
like secrets management like it's not

1180
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,280
great um

1181
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,800
hypothetically speaking at twilio and

1182
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,319
that that's like part of the

1183
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,119
um

1184
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,640
the uh

1185
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,520
platform right um what we were thinking

1186
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,359
is okay that should be attributed to the

1187
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,520
platform level or like that big part of

1188
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,599
the business maybe even r d and it's

1189
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,280
kind of the cto that needs to figure out

1190
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,560
how to burn that down so it gets

1191
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,880
attributed at you know their particular

1192
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,280
level but it's not i don't know if i can

1193
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,640
give you a better answer than that but

1194
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,800
happy to to brainstorm some ideas

1195
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,240
offline but yeah it's a good question

1196
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,720
yes

1197
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,119
uh does the process flow still hold true

1198
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,720
for zero days yeah we push it through

1199
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,040
into the same system as much as possible

1200
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,040
um so yeah zero days typically uh it's

1201
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,160
people aren't going to extend those for

1202
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,000
too long but yeah i mean it's possible

1203
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,520
they could extend them and and we want

1204
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,839
to make sure that uh it's not too

1205
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,520
egregious of an extension we can't fix

1206
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,680
everything in one day right sometimes it

1207
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,920
takes 10 days 20 days so those

1208
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,160
extensions are they show up in that that

1209
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,119
top loan like a list for that day or for

1210
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,440
that week or that month so um but yeah

1211
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,040
it all ideally gets pushed into the same

1212
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,279
system just so it makes it easier for us

1213
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,960
yes uh yeah actually you have two two

1214
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,560
hands over here yeah either or uh

1215
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,960
yeah so the question is how do you

1216
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,640
uh maybe another way of saying is like

1217
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,839
how do you prevent people from kind of

1218
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,240
sandbagging their budget or putting like

1219
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,960
a high budget in uh relative uh to their

1220
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,319
peers well that that competition uh roll

1221
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:17,680
up that i was talking about earlier when

1222
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,760
you were able to compete compare peers

1223
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,760
to other peers um

1224
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
is one way to kind of combat that right

1225
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,839
if one team is is really sandbagging the

1226
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,839
other team or the other part of the

1227
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,400
division isn't um you would want to

1228
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,560
question that so why why is this part of

1229
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,920
the business um have such a lower budget

1230
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,920
whereas your part of the business has a

1231
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,119
higher budget and maybe maybe there's

1232
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,960
good answers that maybe it's like hey we

1233
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,640
don't have that many customers there's

1234
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,280
no pii there's no sense of data here

1235
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,720
and we're in product market fit so we

1236
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,319
just want to move fast

1237
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,319
okay that's the business to decide like

1238
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,920
as long as there's an appropriate level

1239
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,760
of sign off on that

1240
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,079
and it's not yeah we just let that we

1241
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,920
let that happen it's their decision

1242
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,160
right at the end of the day but we we do

1243
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,400
kind of push that uh compare yourself to

1244
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,680
your peers because you don't want to be

1245
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,920
that person that has a ridiculous budget

1246
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,920
while everyone else has a pretty low one

1247
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,160
it's like okay what's going on here

1248
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,160
yes

1249
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,480
um

1250
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,400
so the question is do we account

1251
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,000
differently for vulnerabilities that

1252
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,839
have a patch versus vulnerabilities that

1253
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,640
do not have a patch um no we don't right

1254
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,040
now um could be something interesting

1255
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,400
like that would be maybe an additional

1256
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
factor that we could add but like i

1257
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,839
mentioned earlier i'm a little hesitant

1258
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,119
to do

1259
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,119
additional factors in that metric until

1260
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,760
people start to adopt it i think one way

1261
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,960
to to

1262
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,200
deal with that is like for the risk

1263
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,680
justifications there's no patch here i

1264
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,839
think that's a lot easier to to say okay

1265
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,520
that makes sense like we we can't fix

1266
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,920
this right now so let's push it off um

1267
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,960
that would just go into that risk

1268
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,040
justification that's how that would

1269
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,400
appear today

1270
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,920
that's a good question

1271
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,520
all right five minutes

1272
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,839
yes

1273
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,839
yeah so we don't so the question is um

1274
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:28,960
actually repeat it one more time make

1275
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,920
sure i grock it

1276
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,440
oh how are you getting the balls to the

1277
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,280
right teams

1278
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,400
yeah um

1279
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,480
we it's an asset management problem at

1280
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,839
the end of the day so

1281
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,720
um one thing that that we built uh

1282
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
segment and it's actually becoming a

1283
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,720
thing over at twilio um we had this

1284
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,240
concept of like ownership so if we can

1285
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,640
attribute every

1286
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,040
repo to a team ideally at like at least

1287
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,720
the division level sometimes at the team

1288
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,960
level that's where we

1289
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,480
we hook off of

1290
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,079
there's a tool called backstage that

1291
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,240
we're looking at for twilio wide that

1292
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,839
can help with that type of asset

1293
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,880
inventory and so yeah it's not

1294
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,079
there's just another fundamental

1295
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,200
component that you need to have in your

1296
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,319
security program which is asset

1297
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,000
management that's not going to be solved

1298
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,800
by this necessarily

1299
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,720
but

1300
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,640
like i said it is a lot easier to figure

1301
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,040
out uh hey we don't who owns this we

1302
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
don't know i mean eventually the cto is

1303
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,319
the one that owns it so you can always

1304
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,240
move up and they have to figure out that

1305
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,680
attribution ideally we don't want to get

1306
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,599
to that level but um

1307
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,400
you know when you're hooking your

1308
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,480
vulnerabilities into the org you can

1309
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,680
escalate up if you need to

1310
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,359
any other questions

1311
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,720
out of time

1312
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,920
or two minutes okay cool

1313
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,760
anything else

1314
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,839
really appreciate the questions so yes

1315
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,399
appreciate the enthusiasm

1316
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,240
say that one more time

1317
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,079
how long does it take for bud um to be

1318
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,720
optimized so the the whole budgeting

1319
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,720
part i i think you might have let me go

1320
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,160
back here real quick it's actually

1321
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,000
future looking like we are doing it

1322
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,040
right now

1323
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,839
um twilio for this year um and so this

1324
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,440
is where we have the budgets my gut

1325
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,760
tells me that this is going to take

1326
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,440
probably a couple more quarters before

1327
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,079
we feel better about it um

1328
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,119
if

1329
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,480
what this is doing is starting the

1330
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,319
conversation like we can't get below 12.

1331
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,079
well why is that let's go into there and

like okay we understand why this is

1333
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,520
maybe harder for you let's say you don't

1334
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,839
have like an infrastructure that runs on

1335
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,680
something like kubernetes you have vms

1336
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,280
and it's very manual it's very painful

1337
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,359
