00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,159
hello

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,840
hello

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
okay let me go

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,919
all right everyone we're getting ready

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,760
to start our next talk

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,639
our speaker is lynn no buyer hacker the

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,920
invisible threat thank

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
you what's happening

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,160
hello california

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,680
if in case you couldn't figure it out

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,920
i'm not from here

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,039
um

13
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,519
first thank you besides for letting me

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,359
actually come out and present this and

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,720
thank you guys for actually showing up

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,920
to listen

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,520
uh we're going to have some fun today

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,360
and we're going to try and go from

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,840
science fiction over to some science

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,079
fact

21
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,840
so

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,680
start up my little clicker here

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,920
a little bit of background on me uh my

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,120
name as she said is leno pronounced no

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,640
opposite of yes and if you ask my

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,000
parents i was named extremely

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,480
appropriately i've heard no no pretty

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,480
much my whole damn life

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,280
um i currently am a

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,760
uh technical evangelist and a white hat

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,720
hacker for cyber software i've been with

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,360
cyber arc for nine years

33
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,840
i've been prof in i.t professionally for

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,479
going on 27 years in roles ranging from

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,360
programmer to systems architect

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,640
but i've been kind of breaking into

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,560
computers and making them do things that

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,920
they weren't supposed to do all the way

39
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,799
back into the commodore 64 days

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,479
so if anybody wants to come out we can

41
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,320
talk about some comma eight comma one

42
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,080
after this is over man i love your mass

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,520
by the way

44
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,640
um i spent uh pretty much most of my

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
time in my youth as either what would be

46
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,040
classified as a black hat or a gray hat

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
uh i'm professionally trained but i've

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,280
come across most of my

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,640
my knowledge through practical

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
application

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
uh i'm actually pretty active on social

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,159
media and i invite everybody get you

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,320
know reach out over linkedin github

54
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
check out some of my my toys and tools

55
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,960
that i throw out there for everybody um

56
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,280
yes that's a qr code yes this is a

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
security conference no this is not going

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,759
to take you anywhere bad

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,280
this would be a very career limiting

60
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,600
move if i decided to do that

61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
but i'm glad to see you all we're

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,479
thinking

63
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,959
so i wanted to start off today's talk by

64
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,239
asking you guys just a pretty simple

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,440
question

66
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,480
what does a cyborg look like

67
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,160
you know when you hear the word cyborg

68
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,040
what comes to your mind maybe terminator

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,360
darth vader star wars star trek

70
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
something like that

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,959
you know i'm not sure what it's going to

72
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,720
be in your head but i'm probably willing

73
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,519
to bet that they have some similarities

74
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,760
they're probably very robotic possibly a

75
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
lot of chrome

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,840
but the truth is that's not the case

77
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,280
cyborgs are not only on the movie

78
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,599
screens anymore you know they walk among

79
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,120
you and you might actually even be

80
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
friends with one of them and you just

81
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,319
don't even know it

82
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,319
these are actually my hands

83
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,480
i am a biohacker in the truest sense of

84
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,440
the word i'm not only an augmented human

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,360
with microchips in my hands but i'm also

86
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,680
as i stated earlier i'm a white hat

87
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
so i'm a hacker that has actually

88
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,040
modified my body to take advantage of

89
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,920
the available technology to turn myself

90
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,879
into

91
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,959
the attack vector

92
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,319
you know i'm gonna go through uh what

93
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,159
you see on the x-rays here and i'll give

94
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,519
you a little bit of information about

95
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,840
each one of the chips and i actually

96
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,920
have some more implants since the time

97
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,640
these x-ray rays were actually taken

98
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,239
so we're going to go through and we'll

99
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,480
start here with this one this is

100
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,959
actually called a flex next this is a

101
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,840
combination rfid and nfc chip

102
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,920
this one and the one right below it

103
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,280
which is the next chip these are

104
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,000
essentially the exact same chips

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,480
uh i started with the standard next chip

106
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,840
this is a biogas encapsulated microchip

107
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,920
and we'll be going into a little bit of

108
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,519
more explanation in terms of what the

109
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,360
differences are between the bioglass and

110
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,959
the flexible membrane implants in a

111
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,560
couple of slides

112
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,000
but

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,840
the next chip as i said this was

114
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,280
actually the very first implant that i

115
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,720
ever got

116
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,760
and this all of my implants were

117
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,599
installed for the specific purposes of

118
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,280
offensive security

119
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,239
so once i got this one i was able to get

120
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,959
it installed into my body i realized

121
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,840
that it did not give me the range i need

122
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,599
in order to be able to hold a phone in

123
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,519
its natural position

124
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,320
you know

125
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,199
the

126
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,320
antenna on the actual next chip is very

127
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,240
very small so and as such you almost

128
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,199
have to be sitting right on top of the

129
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,040
uh receiver in order for it to actually

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,199
be able to read clearly

131
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,680
the flex next is a larger version of

132
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,520
this and actually gets me up to about an

133
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
inch and a half to two inches worth of

134
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
distance away from the reader in order

135
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,759
to be able to actually energize the chip

136
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,960
and be able to re send and receive data

137
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,880
so this was the chip that actually

138
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,320
allowed me that

139
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,240
ergonomics of being able to actually

140
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,400
hold your cell phone or mobile device in

141
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,600
my hand in a normal configuration and

142
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
the signal will actually pass through

143
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,440
the meat of my hand to the large implant

144
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,400
i have

145
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,280
on the top of this hand

146
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,840
i have a flex m1 magic

147
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,520
uh this is

148
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,639
basically the a myfair classic with the

149
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
1k rewritable function

150
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,280
this will allow me to emulate pretty

151
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,759
much any number of older access cards

152
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,639
from public transit to membership tokens

153
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,880
to physical access

154
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,039
for buildings believe it or not most of

155
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,280
the hotels that i stay in are all us

156
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,360
still using my fair classic or my fair

157
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,800
ultra lights

158
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,440
uh i also have what is called a vivo key

159
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,120
spark 2.

160
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,479
this is actually a cryptobionic chip

161
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,240
it's actually part of a multi-factor

162
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
authentication

163
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,440
uh routine that i've set up to be able

164
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,400
to access my crypto wallet uh this one

165
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,360
actually does have its own ecosystem and

166
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,960
is actually something that's being

167
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,199
pushed for multi-factor fido otp

168
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,360
uh if you definitely something to look

169
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,759
into they are currently working both

170
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,800
within the united states and in japan

171
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
okay

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,560
since the time these x-rays were taken i

173
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,680
have a quite a few additional implants i

174
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,840
have a flex e m

175
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
in my wrist right here underneath the

176
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
nose of the the skull on this tattoo

177
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
and that actually allows me the ability

178
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,479
to emulate pretty much the rest of the

179
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,639
popular physical access cards including

180
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,880
procs one two and three

181
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,360
hid indala pyramid and just a ton more

182
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,600
i also have a titan biomagnet in my left

183
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
pinky

184
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,880
this is not one of the gimmicky magnets

185
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
it's not meant to be able to pick up a

186
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
lot of heavy weight but what it does

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,800
allow me the ability is it allows me to

188
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
feel electromagnetic fields and

189
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,280
electromagnetic currents

190
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,639
i get asked all the time lin what does

191
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,240
that do for you

192
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,960
i do physical pen tests as well

193
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,880
and i'd be willing to bet quite a bit of

194
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,319
money that if we went out and take a

195
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
look at any of y'all's warehouses

196
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,120
pretty much most warehouse

197
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,880
exterior doors are all using the same

198
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,039
types of locking mechanisms everybody

199
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,919
uses magnetic maglocks

200
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,759
maglocks require power for an

201
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,680
electromagnet i can actually stand on

202
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,120
the outside of your building and run my

203
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,720
hands over your wall and i can actually

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,199
find the line of electricity going to

205
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,800
that magnet

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
i'm not saying it will but it can open

207
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,080
up the opportunities of different

208
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,919
options for shimming

209
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,039
uh power interruption it just allows me

210
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,639
the ability to see what's going on

211
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,680
inside the wall

212
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,759
i currently have sitting at home right

213
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,240
now i actually have a des fire v2 8k nfc

214
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
chip as well as a new chip that's

215
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,160
recently hit the market called the

216
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
wallet more uh the wallet more is

217
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
actually an implantable chip that allows

218
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
me to do tap to pay the same way we can

219
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,400
do with android

220
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
wallet and

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,039
ipay

222
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,240
or any of your nfc based credit cards uh

223
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,400
so these are two implants that i'm just

224
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,720
waiting for time to get into my body mod

225
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,440
guy and we'll be adding those to my

226
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,039
body and we'll just

227
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,160
you know it's kind of like getting an

228
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,759
upgrade you know on your car you know i

229
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,160
want i just want some new functions man

230
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,919
you know i'll be the new len 3.0

231
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,560
so as i said augmented humans are not

232
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,879
science fiction we're here we're not

233
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,599
going anywhere and as this technology

234
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,520
continues to evolve

235
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,759
so will we

236
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,680
i've broken the today's talk down into

237
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,039
three different parts we're going to do

238
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,599
a yesterday today and tomorrow i'm not

239
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,958
going to spend a whole bunch of time on

240
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,360
the history of the transhuman movement

241
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,120
just a little bit to kind of give you an

242
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,519
idea of where we kind of got our start

243
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,320
and that the biohacker or transhuman is

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,680
actually the point where science

245
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,320
technology and humanity all meet

246
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
and since we are sitting at a b-sides

247
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,959
conference i've actually even had people

248
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,120
ask me would i be the point where

249
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,040
machine identity and human identity

250
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,080
cross

251
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,200
you know that's just one of those things

252
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,399
to kind of put in the back of your head

253
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,320
because technically i do have

254
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,080
my human identity but i also have the

255
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,040
ability to do machine identity

256
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
things to think about

257
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,000
so

258
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,160
the idea behind implanting technology

259
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,600
inside the human bodies has actually

260
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,080
been around since the 1950s

261
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,600
the patent for the first cardiac

262
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,920
pacemaker was actually submitted in 1952

263
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,800
and it was the size of a table radio

264
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
with the advent of the transistor in the

265
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
mid-1950s the ability to construct a

266
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
fully implantable device was achieved in

267
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,040
may of 1958

268
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,600
1964

269
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,080
gave us the first implantable technology

270
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,160
that could take data from the body is

271
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
feedback and make adjustments

272
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,839
accordingly

273
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,560
throughout the 70s and the 80s

274
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,080
you know there was some stuff that

275
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
happened but i mean it wasn't like major

276
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,720
breakthroughs

277
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,320
1990 is when things really started to

278
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,560
change for the transhuman or implant

279
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
community from the creation of smart

280
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,360
devices smart prosthetics all the way up

281
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,079
through to artificial intelligence which

282
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,880
is pretty commonplace in today's society

283
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,120
for biohackers and trans humans our

284
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,959
history was forged by the medical

285
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,040
profession to address deficiencies of

286
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,399
the human body

287
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,880
but from a reactive perspective

288
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,959
and by that i mean that the issues were

289
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,480
already there

290
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,160
you know and additionally there were no

291
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,079
options for any type of individual to

292
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,560
enhance themselves through any type of

293
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,440
elected surgery for the per or through

294
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,880
any type of technology that was

295
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,040
available

296
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,360
so that brings us to today

297
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,320
who are we as trans humans today

298
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
people like myself are referred to by

299
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,079
all kinds of different names

300
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,040
biohacker grinder transhuman i was

301
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,680
actually in sweden uh two weeks a couple

302
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,839
of weeks ago and i was told that i am

303
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,920
what is known as a wetwork that was a

304
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,720
new one on me first time i've heard it

305
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,480
it's okay you know it doesn't matter

306
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,000
what you want to call me

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,800
you know regardless of the label you

308
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
know i'm just another person in a very

309
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,959
long line of people who shared the same

310
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,040
concept of moving beyond the human form

311
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,200
that we were born into

312
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
actually the term transhuman was

313
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,360
actually first coined by an englishman

314
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,040
by the name of julian huxley back in

315
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,200
1957

316
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,560
you know and the movement that he

317
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,560
created was fueled by multiple people

318
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,240
looking to extend the capabilities of

319
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,600
the human being itself

320
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,959
so when we talk about implantable

321
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,760
technology where do we find it anybody

322
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,200
want anybody want to give me a guess

323
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,399
here

324
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
come on

325
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,440
close

326
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
close if we can do it at radio shack

327
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,800
that would be so awesome but the truth

328
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
is it's the same place we find

329
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,920
everything else

330
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,880
close

331
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,320
internet

332
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,519
you know i got actually i'm going to

333
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,800
check i don't know if i can get them on

334
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
amazon or not but i wouldn't

335
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,399
i wouldn't be surprised

336
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,279
you know

337
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,120
here in the united states

338
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,399
if you this is something that you're

339
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,000
interested in definitely hit me up when

340
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,839
i'm done i'll be happy to go into more

341
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,680
specifics uh i do not work for this

342
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,279
company i'm just gonna get throw this

343
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,480
out there because it's usually one of

344
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,320
the first questions i get where can you

345
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,120
find these things uh i get all of my

346
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,519
stuff from a distributor here in the u.s

347
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,959
they're based out of seattle washington

348
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,760
they're called dangerousthings.com

349
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,600
yeah i know i thought they were it was

350
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,000
an amazing name for an amazing company

351
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
um in europe there's an additional

352
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,560
company called k-sec they these guys are

353
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,760
kind of the the two big ones in north

354
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
and south america and in europe

355
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,120
uh do your research this is kind of like

356
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,880
the idea of getting a tattoo or a body

357
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,680
piercing but a little bit more crazy

358
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,800
so

359
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,480
you know when we talk about the types of

360
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,120
implants available you know

361
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
what are the use cases i get that

362
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,920
question all the time so we have magnets

363
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,560
and we have multiple types of magnets

364
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,279
you have lifting magnets as well as

365
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,360
biosensing magnets

366
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,639
now

367
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,000
you know everybody asked me at len are

368
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,519
you afraid of you know what are you

369
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,279
afraid of and are you you know you are

370
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,560
you afraid that these things are going

371
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,079
to move it's going to move to your heart

372
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,200
you know some you know you're being

373
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
tracked by the man no what i'm afraid of

374
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,120
is other very very strong magnets

375
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,880
you don't know pain

376
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
until somebody throws an earth magnet at

377
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,279
you and it snaps onto the magnet that's

378
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,680
inside your finger and squeezing from

379
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,639
both inside and outside of your skin

380
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,959
not pleasant

381
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,880
my magnets like i said are not meant to

382
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,240
lift things

383
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,760
but if that's your thing rock on

384
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,040
have flexible membrane implants

385
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,880
as you can see the chip itself very

386
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,199
small but we have a very large coil of

387
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,480
copper wire

388
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,399
this is the antenna

389
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,000
this is why when i was originally

390
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,399
showing you guys my x-rays the very

391
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,000
first one was that bio glass

392
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,680
encapsulated

393
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,600
that's what this looks is

394
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,399
so if you can take a look at this

395
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,639
those little glass tubes are not much

396
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,800
bigger than a grain of long grain rice

397
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,600
the

398
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
flexible membranes they're about two and

399
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
a half to three inches long so you can

400
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
definitely see the difference in terms

401
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,880
of antenna size which will also be

402
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,959
proportionate to the amount of distance

403
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,240
you're going to need to be from your

404
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,440
reader in order to energize that tag

405
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,800
and due to the fact that this is

406
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,560
california and i know you guys are like

407
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,839
a party town we also have leds

408
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,279
you know so i mean if you guys want to

409
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,360
go partying out at night you know and

410
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,279
you can do the whole you know i am iron

411
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,320
man you can have it blinking in your

412
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,160
hand whatever you know

413
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,440
i'm one of those guys that if you want

414
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,120
to join my my club of crazy cyborgs i

415
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,519
don't care what you put in your body

416
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,560
you know i

417
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,519
i do have the ability if you guys would

418
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,000
like hit me up offline i can we can go

419
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,800
into the processes in order to install

420
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,199
these and i do use the term install

421
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,639
because it is kind of hardware going

422
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,920
into the body

423
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,800
but

424
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,480
this is surgery

425
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
this is scalpels this is dermal

426
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,000
elevators this is

427
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,279
sutures

428
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,480
this is not necessarily a

429
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,360
fool's errand

430
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,000
you know when we talk about these

431
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,680
devices and what they were originally

432
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,839
intended for they were designed to make

433
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
people's lives easier

434
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,680
you know for anybody out there with a

435
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,040
tesla model three there's actually a

436
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,320
implant that you can actually get the

437
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,600
valet

438
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,120
key

439
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,639
added to an implant put that in your

440
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,240
hand and you can just jump in your car

441
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
and drive

442
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,399
you know or maybe people have like a

443
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,480
little fob to get into a gym

444
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,880
or a shared garage

445
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,199
you know like i said we have the wallet

446
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,480
more now so we can actually do

447
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
contactless payment the same way that

448
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,320
you can with credit cards

449
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,480
or even your mobile device and every

450
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,079
single one of these would actually

451
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,720
constitute a legitimate use case for

452
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,040
these types of devices

453
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,120
unfortunately

454
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
just like in the real world not all of

455
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,880
us are friendly

456
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
you know as security professionals we

457
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,839
need to start looking beyond what we're

458
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,199
comfortable with

459
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,279
you know beyond the normal attacks that

460
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,440
we've been dealing with for years

461
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,360
you know the attacks in the end game may

462
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
not have changed but the delivery method

463
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,959
is literally coming right off the movie

464
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,279
screen in into our companies

465
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,279
you know as security admins we know the

466
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,800
normal attack vectors but how do you

467
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,399
address the fact that any one of your

468
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,800
employees could potentially have a full

469
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,079
linux system beneath their skin

470
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,920
what if somebody implanted you know an

471
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,440
hid or a prox access card if i've wind

472
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,920
up in a restricted location on prem you

473
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,079
have zero indications of compromise in

474
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,720
terms of how i got there and your dfir

475
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,360
team is going to play hell

476
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,199
you know chip implants use the exact

477
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,519
same technologies that the enterprises

478
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,399
are using rfid for door badges nfc for

479
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,839
iot my fair and hid proximity cards and

480
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
that's just a couple of them

481
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,399
with a number of regulations and audits

482
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,920
that companies are required to do for

483
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,680
your compliance

484
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,880
how would you know if somebody had

485
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
bypassed your security and brought a

486
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,119
rogue asset into your environment

487
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,079
the very simple answer is you would not

488
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,240
this is called a peg leg

489
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,839
this is a single board computer that's

490
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,839
been modified to a minimalist form

491
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,319
factor with a wireless charging receiver

492
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,679
and then encased in some type of

493
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,240
biopolymer and then implanted within the

494
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,919
body typically in the

495
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,599
on the front of the leg right below

496
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,280
where the pockets are

497
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,200
and the reason being is because you take

498
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,039
an external battery pack that can do

499
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,440
rapid charging slip that into the pocket

500
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,000
and it'll actually power up the device

501
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,919
you know the possibilities for this are

502
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,280
pretty much endless because at this

503
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,960
point you have the ability to have a

504
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,919
wi-fi hotspot you also can access this

505
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,280
device over

506
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,120
uh ssh

507
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,559
and if you're crazy enough like me

508
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,160
you've actually given enough thought to

509
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,520
the point of actually cutting your leg

510
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,679
open and actually adding quite a bit of

511
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,840
copper wire to turning your entire leg

512
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,360
into an antenna

513
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,080
and yes i am working on this

514
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,559
i'm actually in in talks with the owner

515
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,000
of dangerous things and they're actually

516
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
going to be encapsulating my devices for

517
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,720
me

518
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,200
i'm working with a kai-cad designer out

519
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,160
of

520
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,480
the dha the dallas hackers association

521
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,440
and we're basically building me a custom

522
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,400
raspberry pi zero type device but with

523
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,559
multiple bluetooth and multiple wi-fi so

524
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,360
i can actually do wi-fi attacks and do

525
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,679
evil twin attacks in areas where i'm not

526
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,039
even allowed to bring in a cell phone

527
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,280
so

528
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,440
everybody here wants to see the attacks

529
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,559
because that's where things really start

530
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,480
getting fun so let's i'm going to start

531
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,840
talking about the first attack i'm

532
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,520
actually going to show you guys this

533
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,039
one's actually around the issues of

534
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,039
physical access

535
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,080
and i'd be willing to bet everyone here

536
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,480
somewhere on your on-prem you have some

537
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
restricted location you know that's just

538
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,120
kind of the part of doing business

539
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
you know and i'd be willing to bet that

540
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,360
probably there are a large

541
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,960
number of people that actually you guys

542
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,679
got your badges on a lanyard or some

543
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,039
kind of

544
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,080
oh i'm seeing people moving

545
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,160
all right let me show you why that's not

546
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,000
necessarily a good thing

547
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,760
so

548
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,160
this is the first attack that i debuted

549
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,400
this one's called handshake this is a

550
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,960
clone and replay attack that utilizes a

551
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,760
tool like a proxmart to read or scrape

552
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
the data that's contained on a card or a

553
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,799
fob

554
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,240
then i'm going to just turn around and

555
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,840
i'm going to write that information back

556
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,400
down to the implant in my hand

557
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,480
and then when i compromise your physical

558
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,720
locations

559
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,000
you can search me you can call the

560
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,840
police you're not going to find any

561
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,440
tools you're not going to find a cloned

562
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,520
card

563
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,559
so

564
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,360
i'm a very open guy i want you guys to

565
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,520
see everything that's happening so

566
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,120
i'm going to give it to you pretty

567
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,720
simple so we're going to start off by

568
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
opening the up the proxmart chameleon

569
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,679
mini tool yes that's my was my id and

570
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,520
yes i look like every hacker clip art

571
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,280
you've ever seen

572
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,120
so the first thing we do is we actually

573
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,240
import the new uid for my badge and

574
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
we're going to go ahead and pull that up

575
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,440
and i'm going to go ahead and just

576
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,720
rename this one to lens id and before

577
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,480
anybody thinks you know about trying to

578
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,400
steal this i've already actually already

579
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,760
got another id but you get an a for

580
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
effort

581
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,520
so from here i need to be able to have a

582
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
baseline so i'm going to scan the myfair

583
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,799
classic card in my my hand we'll get

584
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,679
pull in a new uid

585
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,280
pull it up on screen and we're just

586
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,480
going to go ahead and we're going to

587
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,320
rename that one to

588
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,240
lens id or i'm sorry implant

589
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,960
so now we have our second

590
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,520
piece of information

591
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,720
now

592
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,120
at this point i like to show just in

593
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,880
case i'm part of a larger collective we

594
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,200
can actually share this information and

595
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,720
amongst the rest of the people in my

596
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,880
hacking group

597
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,679
throw it up on google drive your data is

598
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,000
now able to be used by anybody

599
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,440
but just for the fun of it i'm gonna

600
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,280
actually open up a different tool this

601
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,039
one's called the myfair classic tool and

602
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,960
i'm gonna import both of those dumps and

603
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,520
we're gonna run a diff against them

604
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,120
so we import the first file pull it down

605
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,080
and we're gonna grab the second file

606
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,540
import it in

607
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,200
[Music]

608
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,960
and now we're going to go ahead and

609
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,039
we're going to just pull up

610
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,400
the diff we're going to select the

611
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,080
implant and we're going to select my id

612
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,600
the only thing that's different is

613
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,440
sector zero line a

614
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,600
so at this point all i really need to do

615
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,080
is just write the information back down

616
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,960
so i select my id

617
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,799
i can even do this with the cell phone

618
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,480
rewrite it

619
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,559
write all tags write all sectors

620
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,360
data successfully written

621
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,440
so now what we're going to do is go back

622
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
into the

623
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,080
proxmox chameleon mini

624
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
and we're gonna scan my implant one more

625
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
time

626
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,720
so we go ahead and do that move over to

627
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,400
channel three

628
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,919
here's my hand again

629
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,159
here's the here's my implant read the

630
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,360
implant

631
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,520
import the uid we're gonna name this one

632
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,400
implant two

633
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,200
and if you take a look up there at the

634
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,039
top you'll notice that the last four

635
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,520
digits of sector zero line eight should

636
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,320
be

637
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,880
six eight six nine

638
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,000
so there's my implant and here's the id

639
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,960
they're the same

640
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,600
so at this point now i can actually walk

641
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,240
right up to your badge reader

642
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,159
scan my hand and if you have a single

643
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,000
point of failure without any type of

644
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,880
shield or our back or pin

645
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,960
i'm now inside your your secured

646
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
locations and you have no idea how i got

647
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
there

648
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,960
so the next two attacks that i'm going

649
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,240
to be showing

650
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,120
are going to both be utilizing the nfc

651
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,080
or the near field communication protocol

652
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,840
if you're not familiar with nfc most

653
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,440
people have it sitting in their pockets

654
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,960
right now most cell phones have the it

655
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,159
built in

656
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,720
standard use for nfc could be anything

657
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,120
from beaming a file or using an app to

658
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,039
transmit a signal to a receiver to allow

659
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,840
some type of action to take place

660
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,679
and the implant that i'll be using for

661
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,200
the next two attacks is going to be that

662
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,679
flex next which is the large

663
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,320
implant that's in the top of my right

664
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,840
hand

665
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,000
so the first attack i'm going to show

666
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
you is leprosy

667
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,880
yeah hey it's my attack i get to name it

668
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,320
you know this attack

669
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
does require a little bit of social

670
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,440
engineering

671
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,200
and nfc must be enabled uh aside from

672
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,320
that

673
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,240
this one is really really not that hard

674
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,960
so essentially what i'm gonna do

675
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,919
is

676
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,279
i'm going to create a situation

677
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,720
where

678
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,400
as you can probably guess like i said

679
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,880
originally i'm not from california

680
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,640
so if i started getting up here and

681
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
started throwing some major fit about

682
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,559
the fact that my phone's dead

683
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,159
and i was in the middle of a

684
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,320
conversation with my wife and there was

685
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,440
something going on with one of my

686
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,600
grandchildren you know and i was making

687
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,360
some kind of a big fit i guarantee you

688
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,400
somebody here

689
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,919
even though we're at a security

690
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,520
conference they would be there to help

691
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,880
me out

692
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,200
and the truth is all i need to do is get

693
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,679
my hands on the device

694
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,880
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to

695
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,120
use the chip that's in my hand i'm going

696
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,200
to program that chip to point to a

697
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
location out on the web where i will

698
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,520
have an apk that i created with mfs

699
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,480
venom

700
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,880
as part of the metasploit framework

701
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,480
well it looks like i'm trying to

702
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,400
actually make a phone call what i'm

703
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,480
doing is actually installing this so i'm

704
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,120
actually going to act this out for you

705
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,360
again i like to be very up front so on

706
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
the top of the screen what you see is an

707
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,640
a ngrok session for some obfuscation and

708
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,919
we're going to start the metasploit

709
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,480
console down in the secondary lower

710
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,760
frame

711
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,240
so we open up metasploit

712
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,559
load in a resource file

713
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,880
just to make things a little bit quick

714
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,600
execute that start the listener

715
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
okay here we go

716
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,960
we're going to do this in real time for

717
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
you oh my god something happened you

718
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,720
know can somebody help me out here thank

719
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,640
you thank you just all right what's my

720
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,919
wife's phone number uh 734

721
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,000
uh god who actually uses phone numbers

722
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,840
anymore i mean that's just i usually

723
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,559
just pick it up in my contacts okay

724
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,600
gotta remember seven three four

725
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,799
six

726
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,039
one two no that's my phone number what

727
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,880
is my wife's number

728
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,159
good lord something happened to my

729
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,360
three-year-old granddaughter i don't

730
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,640
know what the hell i'd do if that might

731
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,880
happen to her uh seven three four

732
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,480


733
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,559
i can't remember man i really appreciate

734
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,000
it i'm just gonna have to go put you

735
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,960
know plug my phone in

736
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,279
we're already done

737
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,679
just like that there's my reverse tcp

738
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,720
shell

739
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,520
we can pull sysinfo

740
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,080
i can dump your sms calls i can dump

741
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,320
your call list i can even pop a shell

742
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,679
and actually traverse your actual device

743
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,520
at this point

744
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,760
and with this attack also allows me the

745
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,799
ability for advanced persistence

746
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,120
so if we we can actually not just do a

747
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,559
quick ls and you'll see that i'm

748
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,640
actually in the storage device

749
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,640
of that actual

750
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,880
android

751
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,159
so

752
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,159
this is the last use case that we're

753
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,400
going to be discussing today

754
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,440
um

755
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,159
this one i lovingly named flesh hook

756
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,880
i know it's beautiful

757
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,159
this one is a little bit more dangerous

758
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,480
than leprosy is

759
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,799
because this one we're actually going to

760
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,919
take into configuration

761
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,080
the beef suite everybody here familiar

762
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,559
with beef

763
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,240
okay if you're not familiar with beef

764
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,360
this is b-sides go look into it beef in

765
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,200
is one of the most in my opinion

766
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,880
underrated tools

767
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,440
that you know we have when it comes for

768
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
you know popping

769
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,120
web clients

770
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,840
so beef is the browser exploit extension

771
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,960
framework

772
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,559
this is the website where if you

773
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,880
actually log into the website it will

774
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
actually launch a javascript hook the

775
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,120
browser and allow me interaction

776
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,440
on that device up to and including on

777
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,600
device spearfishing

778
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,720
so

779
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,720
what makes this one a little bit more

780
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,799
dangerous than leprosy is the fact that

781
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,399
i don't actually have to install

782
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,159
anything on your device

783
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,760
all i have to do is just get it to

784
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,919
actually interact with the chip and

785
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,240
redirect you to the actual infected

786
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,919
website

787
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,360
considering the fact that i spend a lot

788
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,279
of my time around developers and a lot

789
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,279
of technical people

790
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,440
uh for my the purposes of my

791
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,240
demonstration i actually used the

792
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,440
created a copy of the putty website

793
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,320
and

794
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,240
all i have to do is get your browser to

795
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,760
go to that website

796
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,360
so once again

797
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,880
requires a little bit of social

798
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,480
engineering but as you can see in that

799
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,320
last demonstration i'm a pretty good

800
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,679
actor

801
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,240
so it'll actually take us longer

802
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,760
to actually pull up the beef suite than

803
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,200
it will to actually compromise the

804
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,720
device

805
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,799
so once we go ahead and get this up

806
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,080
we'll go ahead and log into the web ui

807
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,360
from the beef control panel here

808
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,480
and we are ready to actually go ahead

809
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,279
and start trying to hook browsers

810
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,480
again

811
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,960
not that hard you know i can make a fake

812
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,440
google page all i need to do is to get

813
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,679
it to pop up on that device

814
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,600
and again i'm triggering it through the

815
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,880
nfc use of my implants

816
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,559
pulls up putty

817
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,840
and that's really all that's required

818
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,600
back in beef

819
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,760
i hooked a new browser it's an android

820
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,360
device

821
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,880
now we can actually do things like

822
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,520
geo-locate the device

823
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,559
utilizing modules i also have an entire

824
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,320
suite of additional tools that i can

825
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,480
actually utilize

826
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,679
so

827
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,200
like i said let's go ahead and do a get

828
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,159
geo location

829
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,200
gives us a list of different apis that

830
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,840
we can actually choose from

831
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,279
and we'll go ahead and run this and

832
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,880
you'll see very very quickly that it's

833
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
going to actually return

834
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,520
the fact that i am in texas

835
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,840
yep city of pflugerville it's where i

836
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,399
was when i actually recorded this video

837
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,679
we can also get information on types of

838
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,760
internet con connect internet

839
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,840
connectivity we can

840
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,480
launch on-device spear phishing attacks

841
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,679
we can even dns enumerate the whatever

842
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,120
network this device is actually

843
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,320
connected to

844
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,200
so

845
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,279
this brings us to the future part of

846
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,640
this chat

847
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,200
who will we become as technology

848
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,320
continues to evolve

849
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,000
you know when we talk about the future

850
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,960
of you know biomedical and implant

851
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,600
technology in general it's almost like

852
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,799
we're trying to write a brand new

853
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,480
science fiction movie

854
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,080
you know you have companies like tesla

855
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,760
that are working on technology like the

856
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,039
neural ink

857
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,880
you know a brain implant that actually

858
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,039
allows interfacing between the brain

859
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,200
directly to a terminal

860
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,799
you know to me this is just sounds like

861
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,240
a man-in-the-middle situation that's

862
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,279
just waiting to happen

863
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,600
tesla actually released some new data

864
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,720
recently in terms of their trials

865
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,000
and

866
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,640
they i want to say it was they implanted

867
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,960
the chip in 13

868
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,080
monkeys

869
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,000
and they had an issue with seven out of

870
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,880
them

871
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,320
it's not really to the point where i

872
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,000
think i'm ready to let somebody put one

873
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,200
in my head

874
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,720
but what you don't hear a lot about is

875
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,960
neurolink's biggest competitor

876
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
actually is doing amazing work and are

877
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,080
actually have moved into human trials

878
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,760
where they're actually attaching

879
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,600
microchips to spinal columns and

880
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,519
restoring motility to paralyzed people

881
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,120
and they've already it's already proven

882
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,640
they've done it

883
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,960
we also have different things that are

884
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,159
coming out we have the ability to have

885
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,480
smart contact lenses

886
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,480
you know where they're actually looking

887
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,240
at

888
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,360
powering contact lenses with technology

889
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,480
that would allow for facial recognition

890
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,200
personally i'm a big fan of eff out

891
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,720
there don't like the idea but i think

892
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,080
the technology is pretty damn cool

893
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,880
what about things like the will it

894
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,399
if you haven't heard of this this is

895
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,000
actually a bluetooth transmitter and

896
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,320
receiver that requires no internal

897
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,919
batteries and actually gets its power

898
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,760
from the air

899
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
you know or

900
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,679
what about wi-fi implantable wi-fi

901
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,720
transmitters and receivers

902
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,480
you know there's a product out there

903
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
currently under development called the

904
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,760
neuro grain

905
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,080
and it's the hopes of this manufacturer

906
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,679
to actually turn

907
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,600
human beings into the world's largest

908
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,080
wi-fi mesh network

909
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,880
and

910
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,480
we've nev none of us have ever hacked

911
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,840
our neighbor's wifi right

912
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,840
i'm just saying

913
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,600
it'll give hacking the neighbors wi-fi a

914
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,679
whole new meeting if you're actually

915
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,640
hacking a receiver in this person's body

916
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,159
you know and these are just currently

917
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,559
what we know about you know the biggest

918
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,399
restriction to advanced technology

919
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,840
implants is

920
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,000
one thing and one thing only

921
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,760
it's power

922
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,000
there's no current effective way to

923
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,399
provide clean power to any devices on a

924
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,399
commercial implant

925
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,840
you know this is the same issue with the

926
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,320
peg leg and why there's was the need for

927
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,559
the indirect power receiver

928
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,440
you know

929
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,279
it's not always the computer or the

930
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,519
technology that needs to catch up you

931
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,960
know in this case

932
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,240
the only thing that's holding back

933
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,159
progress is power

934
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,519
you know and once that's been addressed

935
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,480
the possibility of a 24x7 access to an

936
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
embedded system inside the human body is

937
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,320
not a far stretch

938
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,919
and with the advents that we're seeing

939
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,559
now with graphene batteries there's also

940
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,120
an amazing new biomedical breakthroughs

941
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,039
where they're actually able to power

942
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,960
generate power from the body's thermal

943
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
dynamics and heat

944
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,679
so

945
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,320
we're not too far off from seeing much

946
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,240
much new advancements in this scope

947
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,000
you know whenever i get into these

948
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,679
conversations

949
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,519
i do want to take a quick minute just to

950
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,320
talk about legality morality and ethical

951
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,559
issues around implantable technologies

952
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,159
from a legal perspective there is

953
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,559
absolutely no federal laws regarding

954
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,519
microchip implants here within the u.s

955
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,279
at the state level as you can see from

956
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,880
the graphic here there are multiple

957
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,640
states that have adopted different types

958
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,240
of legislation

959
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,240
there's pretty much fall into one of two

960
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,360
categories you know one is

961
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,640
basically a ban on employers mandating

962
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,120
that their employees get microchipped

963
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,720
and yes this is something that did come

964
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,880
up they were looking at this as a way

965
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,960
for time and attendance

966
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,000
as well as uh

967
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,159
uh interfacing to the

968
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,719
the equipment within the warehouse and

969
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,239
login log off identification but you

970
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,599
know i'd love to say that this is the

971
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,280
u.s and we don't force people to get

972
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
shots and things put in their body but

973
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,719
we all went through covid and i'm not

974
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,320
going to go down that political rabbit

975
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,000
hole

976
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,960
the other

977
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,639
typical legislation that we have seen is

978
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,359
just a general ban on microchip implants

979
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,719
period

980
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,280
you know so

981
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,560
let's take a minute and talk about

982
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,599
liability from an employer's perspective

983
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,599
if an employee gets chipped does that in

984
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,440
and of itself make that employee a

985
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,359
security risk

986
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,800
what if they're just using the chip to

987
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,719
access a gym or they're using it so that

988
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,480
they can drive their tesla

989
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,960
is that something that a ciso or a cio

990
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,200
would feel that they should be in

991
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,040
informed about

992
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,599
you know we allow our you know employees

993
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,920
to bring personal cell phones to work

994
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,160
with the exclusion of restricted areas

995
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
but detection of these types of devices

996
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,560
is very easy to see

997
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,160
you know

998
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,400
when it comes to implants from a

999
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,720
security perspective you know this may

1000
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,119
help from a i forgot to bring my badge

1001
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,119
to work today kind of a perspective but

1002
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,359
it does not necessarily increase this

1003
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,240
the posture of the security scope for

1004
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,400
that organization

1005
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,160
you know if you're sitting on decide to

1006
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,400
go out drinking on friday night you can

1007
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,560
leave your work badge at home

1008
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,880
once you put these chips in you they're

1009
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,040
on all the time

1010
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,640
you know

1011
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,079
people have actually asked me what do i

1012
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,560
do to make sure that i'm protected i

1013
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,480
actually had to go out and have faraday

1014
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,640
gloves created so that i could actually

1015
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,040
take myself to defcon black cat and i

1016
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,440
can go around people that may try to you

1017
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,240
know abuse my technology

1018
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,079
before you ask no they could not do

1019
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,760
anything that could physically cause me

1020
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,000
pain harm or anything like that but what

1021
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,680
they could do is actually close out the

1022
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,520
tags to the point where i could no

1023
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,000
longer write new data to them and use

1024
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,800
them

1025
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,160
at which point i would actually have to

1026
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,599
have them removed and replaced

1027
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,800
um i've had you have no idea the amount

1028
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,599
of

1029
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,599
you know questions i've had been asked

1030
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,920
since i decided to go down this road

1031
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,640
um some of my favorites are uh is the

1032
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,400
big lump in your hand did you get that

1033
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,800
after you got your covet vaccine

1034
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,240
yes

1035
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,720
uh is this the same chip that's in my my

1036
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
dog or my cat

1037
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,960
possibly i mean it's basically one of

1038
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,200
two styles it's either an nfc chip or an

1039
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,920
rfid chip so technically the answer is

1040
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,280
yes

1041
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,560
um the one that i love is i've actually

1042
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,480
been targeted by some alt

1043
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,480
some extreme religious groups

1044
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,240
this is the one that i'm currently

1045
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,119
dealing with right now i am now a target

1046
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,119
for the religious extremes and

1047
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,079
apparently i have the mark of the beast

1048
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,400
news to me didn't know

1049
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,359
i always thought i was a pretty nice guy

1050
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,760
you know but i've had people

1051
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,560
that i have known my entire life

1052
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,240
you know if i walk into a room they'll

1053
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,560
shut their phones off they'll turn take

1054
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,640
the batteries out of their phones

1055
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,240
i have been received with everything

1056
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,520
from skepticism to downright fear

1057
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,440
it's my hope that

1058
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,760
you know as i did say earlier on in the

1059
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,000
presentation unfortunately not all of us

1060
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,040
are friendly but most of us are

1061
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,200
you know finally

1062
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,160
how far is too far

1063
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,240
you know we've briefly touched on the

1064
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,800
neural link and the peg leg

1065
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,160
you know these are two very different

1066
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,760
products with broad sweeping

1067
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,480
ramifications to the individual as well

1068
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,200
as employers and law enforcement

1069
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,040
you know i'm going to carbon date myself

1070
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,560
here but i remember a movie from back in

1071
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,599
1995 called johnny mnemonic

1072
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,520
you know where the lead actor had a hard

1073
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,040
drive in his head

1074
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,839
and was using it as a storage device and

1075
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,599
he was transporting you know stolen data

1076
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,680
or you know what about the matrix where

1077
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,000
if we want to learn something we just

1078
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,400
basically load the skill set and we have

1079
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,280
it

1080
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,800
you know the genie is out of the bottle

1081
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,480
and there is absolutely no way that it's

1082
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,920
going to go back in

1083
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,680
and as technology continues to advance

1084
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,520
and improve the quality of life we need

1085
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,079
to remember that any tool regardless of

1086
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,000
what its original intent was can be

1087
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,359
misused

1088
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,880
and as security professionals we need to

1089
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,800
be aware of this and adapt our counter

1090
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
measures to include these new types of

1091
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,960
attack vectors

1092
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,079
and the fact that there's nothing

1093
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,920
unilateral across the board will mean

1094
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,160
that most locations this is going to

1095
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,079
become a corporate decision on how to

1096
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,200
address

1097
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,960
augmented humans

1098
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,400
and without a better understanding of

1099
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,720
the technologies being discussed these

1100
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,320
choices may be made for the wrong

1101
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,800
reasons to say anyone with an implanted

1102
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,640
technology is an automatic threat would

1103
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,800
be saying that any car owner could be a

1104
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,040
vehicular homicide suspect somewhere in

1105
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
the future

1106
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,920
so

1107
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,560
the fact is there's no real way to

1108
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,280
detect this type of technology currently

1109
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,200
so the only thing that we can do as

1110
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,800
security administrators and

1111
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,040
professionals is we need to basically

1112
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,440
just keep on that layered approach and

1113
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,599
don't allow single points of access or

1114
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,760
single points of compromise

1115
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,040
if you're using

1116
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,920
just a standard one read badge to get

1117
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,320
into a restricted location

1118
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,640
you wouldn't do that with your data we

1119
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,040
multi-factor everything there are

1120
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,560
multiple different options that we can

1121
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,920
do from a pin

1122
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,880
to our back to shields

1123
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,359
there's other options

1124
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,880
and as far as when it comes to

1125
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,599
compromising your mobile devices

1126
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,520
the best advice i can give you is if

1127
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,040
you're not using nfc turn it off

1128
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,400
it is an

1129
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,680
insecure protocol at its core

1130
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,839
and as such

1131
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,160
trying to correct a

1132
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,240
physical limitation of a protocol with

1133
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,560
application security is never going to

1134
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,720
be a hundred percent

1135
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,640
so with that

1136
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,319
i would like to open the floor to any

1137
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,279
type of questions

1138
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,839
seriously a nun

1139
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,000
okay come on i was gonna say this is the

1140
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,440
weirdest thing you guys have heard all

1141
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,960
day and there were no questions

1142
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,680
about any other

1143
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,359
sorry

1144
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,599
i was just wondering if you had any any

1145
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,920
consequences especially physically like

1146
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,680
i don't know for i'm thinking if you

1147
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,960
have to go

1148
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,720
get like your brain scanned i know you

1149
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,480
cannot have implants things like that at

1150
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,720
airports when you cross things like that

1151
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,800
um

1152
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,680
the simple answer is mris are no longer

1153
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,440
something i can do

1154
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,040
uh if i go into an mri it will rip them

1155
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,119
right out of my body i actually have it

1156
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,880
on all of my emergency forms i'm

1157
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,560
actually going in a couple of weeks and

1158
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,119
getting it tattooed no mri across both

1159
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,560
of my hands

1160
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,599
um

1161
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,200
in terms of fit

1162
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,560
my personal

1163
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,960
you know issues i did have one bit of an

1164
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,560
issue when i had the big one put in the

1165
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,400
top of my hand

1166
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,520
excuse me

1167
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,359
it was my own damn fault

1168
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,920
just like any other surgery you know my

1169
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,839
body mod guy told me he's like you know

1170
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,000
get on anti-inflammatories prior to

1171
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,160
going in i didn't do it

1172
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,480
you know i waited and i wound up getting

1173
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
a hematoma on the top of my hand it

1174
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,599
looked like i had about a half a

1175
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,480
softball in there for about two weeks

1176
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,359
i went to my actual doctor and

1177
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,359
they wanted to schedule me for emergency

1178
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,040
removal surgery and it was like i just

1179
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,720
paid a lot of money to put that in there

1180
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,960
can i just get some motrin

1181
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,480
uh so

1182
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,880
yeah they doctors don't know what the

1183
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,560
hell to make of me

1184
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,000
um

1185
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,319
that was probably the worst thing that's

1186
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,079
happened to me from like a personal

1187
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,599
health perspective

1188
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,640
but

1189
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,200
you know i i like i said i got two two

1190
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,119
more sitting at home and i'm as soon as

1191
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,960
i get home from this trip i'll be adding

1192
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,119
those to the the

1193
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,800
the body and getting new functionality

1194
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,800
welcome

1195
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,160
okay

1196
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,960
uh have you had any issues with implants

1197
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,880
that are now outdated or you that you've

1198
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,920
had removed and replaced or upgraded and

1199
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,359
i'm specifically thinking about the

1200
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,040
wallet one that you mentioned and the

1201
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,680
technology that's in that okay

1202
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,720
good question um

1203
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,800
i haven't been lucky enough that where i

1204
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,760
have not had any of my chips go bad uh

1205
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,400
the nice thing about the chips is we're

1206
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,319
dealing with basically technology and

1207
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,480
protocols so they really don't change

1208
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,000
uh

1209
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
there is some issues with the wallet

1210
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,599
more and it's actually something that's

1211
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,680
actually been brought up a lot in some

1212
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,200
of the reddit conversations and there

1213
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,280
was actually something posted

1214
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,720
i want to say it was two or three days

1215
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,839
ago by the wallet more staff

1216
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:10,839
the

1217
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,400
anyone

1218
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,880
who gets one of these implants there is

1219
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,200
a limitation on the amount of time that

1220
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,800
they'll be valid for it's just like a

1221
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,760
credit card um due to the fact that you

1222
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,920
know the initial

1223
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,520
uh chips that were released actually had

1224
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,200
a little bit lower amount of time than

1225
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,960
they wanted all us

1226
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,040
uh they call us ambassadors because we

1227
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,200
all know that the word guinea pig is not

1228
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,119
a really good thing to say

1229
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,839
but i mean we all know what we are so

1230
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:39,839
there they'll be actually giving us a

1231
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,720
replacement before the end of 2023 that

1232
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,640
will actually keep us i want to say it's

1233
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,520
for an additional four years past that

1234
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,000
at that point you know it's going to be

1235
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,520
either a get it replaced or we'll have

1236
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,200
to see where the technology goes between

1237
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,759
now and then

1238
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,160
hey

1239
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,640
great talk um questions

1240
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,119
things that are considerations for like

1241
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,319
tsa

1242
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,319
or custom when you're going in and out

1243
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,200
of the country or a new doctor medical

1244
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,839
procedures er i mean

1245
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,599
lots of potential

1246
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,480
issues so go from there uh

1247
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,160
believe it or not i do fly

1248
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,760
internationally i was actually just in

1249
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,319
sweden about two and a half weeks ago uh

1250
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,960
there is not enough metal within all of

1251
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,280
my implants to trigger any type of

1252
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,599
aviation magnetometer

1253
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,240
uh also i've been through the full body

1254
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,920
scan x-ray things and

1255
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,359
they don't find them

1256
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,520
i mean when you look at

1257
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,440
the one that i would expect them to find

1258
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,280
would actually be the magnet because

1259
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,760
it's actually an iron corer with a titan

1260
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,680
wrapped in titanium

1261
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,400
that one is the biggest amount of metal

1262
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,560
but even through all the rest of them

1263
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,040
they may be very large but at the same

1264
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,839
time most of it is uh bio

1265
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,480
biomass material or biopolymer so

1266
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,480
there's really not a lot of metal the

1267
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,640
circuitry is actually going to be

1268
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,680
silicone so the amount of actual metal

1269
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,319
is not that much

1270
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,359
which

1271
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,280
i'm really kind of nervous because i'm

1272
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,640
actually going to be giving a bit of a

1273
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,359
varied version of this talk to interpol

1274
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,760
here in a couple of months

1275
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
i might not have the same ability to go

1276
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,680
in and out of airports and customs as

1277
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,920
easily afterwards but

1278
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,200
you know you go where you go where the

1279
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,799
the boss tells you to go

1280
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,000
have you ever had the feeling that your

1281
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
telephone was vibrating wasn't in the

1282
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,680
same room as you

1283
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,920
yes how do you feel about that

1284
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,240
vibratey

1285
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,520
i meant more at a deeper level but

1286
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,720
bad all right really really bad

1287
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,800
although the one thing that actually in

1288
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,319
terms of feeling stuff the one that

1289
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,000
actually is the worst for me is my

1290
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,880
wife's can opener she's got one of those

1291
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,520
you know nice big heavy duty can openers

1292
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,760
and i can be in all i have to be is in

1293
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,640
the general vicinity and she opens a can

1294
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,560
and i can actually feel it in that

1295
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,560
magnet even if i'm three to five feet

1296
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,520
away

1297
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,839
so

1298
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,960
i mean

1299
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,640
i'm telling you she's just running you

1300
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,879
over here

1301
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,480
so

1302
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,440
uh in future as you as this technology

1303
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,599
evolves and companies and governments

1304
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,520
start to start noticing it how do you

1305
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,720
see the impact on insurance and

1306
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,160
how do insurance companies will take

1307
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,440
this from a

1308
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,040
body mod perspective

1309
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,800
to be honest it's something i've

1310
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
actually given a lot of thought to

1311
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,480
um

1312
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,839
the fact that we're seeing as much

1313
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,520
espionage

1314
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,520
i'm surprised

1315
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,680
let me rephrase i would not be surprised

1316
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,839
if the governments were not doing using

1317
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,319
some type of this technology

1318
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,520
for

1319
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,359
nation-state activities

1320
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,000
uh i do know for a fact that i'm not the

1321
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,599
only guy here in the states that are

1322
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,520
doing this i know a couple of actual red

1323
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,720
teamers

1324
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,119
who i'm not going to call them out

1325
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,880
it's not my place

1326
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,839
but i know that this type of process has

1327
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,760
been used as an initial foothold during

1328
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,920
red team engagements to gain that

1329
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,839
initial foothold on a mobile device then

1330
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,599
lateral through the mobile device back

1331
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,599
into the enterprise through enterprise

1332
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,119
based application and vpn

1333
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,599
this is all very cool

1334
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,520
wouldn't it be just as easy to put it in

1335
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,640
jewelry

1336
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,880
yeah but here's the difference

1337
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,119
the main thing and the first thing i

1338
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,960
said when i decided to go

1339
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,200
do this research is i'm not doing

1340
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,800
anything that necessarily hasn't been

1341
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,040
done i'm just doing it with in a way

1342
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,000
that there are zero iocs

1343
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,559
i mean realistically if i have if you

1344
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,640
catch me and i've got like a gaudy

1345
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,960
bracelet or i mean i've i started off

1346
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,520
honestly using like the nfc rings

1347
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,359
and different rfid jewelry and it was it

1348
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,440
was good but at the same time if i got

1349
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,480
caught

1350
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,079
there would be some type of indication

1351
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,680
of how i got in there

1352
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,720
what i'm doing now is in my opinion the

1353
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,880
ultimate you know sneaking under the

1354
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,720
radar because even if you caught me in

1355
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,040
your data center all i have to do is say

1356
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,720
door was open

1357
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,359
okay well we i can't you can't search me

1358
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,040
because you're not an authority but even

1359
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,040
if you called the police they could come

1360
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,520
over empty my pockets they could

1361
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,680
you know there's no way for you to prove

1362
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,520
how i got in there

1363
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,680
and from an obfuscation perspective

1364
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,920
that's what these new attack vectors

1365
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,079
really you know have going for them is

1366
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,000
the fact that nobody knows that they

1367
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,440
exist

1368
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,000
so how do you prevent somebody like me

1369
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,599
if you don't even know somebody like me

1370
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,599
is real

1371
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,400
thanks no problem

1372
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,119
you're getting your steps in today man

1373
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,119
yeah

1374
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,559
so you get caught in somewhere where

1375
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,160
you're not supposed to be and right now

1376
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,000
they don't know they wouldn't think of

1377
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,359
scanning you but what about when it

1378
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:25,040
starts becoming better known and they

1379
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,040
bring out the wands and start going up

1380
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,760
and down and looking well if

1381
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,240
what do you what's the sensitivity

1382
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,599
i mean if it's the same as a

1383
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,760
magnetometer in an airport you're not

1384
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,440
going to find nothing on top of the fact

1385
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,960
that here in the united states we have

1386
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,480
something called hipaa which anything

1387
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,640
that's inside my body you're not legally

1388
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,400
allowed to ask me about anyway

1389
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,319
didn't even scan for

1390
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,000
you can scan but all i got to do is say

1391
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,559
it's medical

1392
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,000
i've tied you i've tied your hands

1393
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,760
hey you know just remember bureaucracy

1394
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,680
and regulations can work both ways

1395
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,079
uh hi are you currently talking about

1396
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,640
state of things here in u.s because i

1397
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,480
would like to understand what's going on

1398
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,240
say in china

1399
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,640
from the same like basically in the same

1400
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,960
state of what's the state of art there

1401
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,000
uh

1402
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,559
the state is the same everywhere i

1403
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,559
actually just got done having a

1404
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,760
discussion with uh one of the japanese

1405
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,599
newspapers

1406
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,440
you know as far as i'm aware i'm the

1407
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,480
first guy that's actually come out and

1408
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,880
you know shown this as a viable attack

1409
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,880
methodology i'm not going to say i'm the

1410
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,640
guy that invented it i'm just the one

1411
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,119
that's bringing it forward

1412
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,200
but to the best of my knowledge these

1413
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,800
particular

1414
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,800
vectors have not been used in the wild

1415
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,960
for an actual breach but like i said

1416
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,720
they have been used in red team

1417
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,720
exercises so uh i know that they work

1418
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:04,400
well and that

1419
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,680
there's no more questions i just want to

1420
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,119
say thank you guys very much for coming

1421
