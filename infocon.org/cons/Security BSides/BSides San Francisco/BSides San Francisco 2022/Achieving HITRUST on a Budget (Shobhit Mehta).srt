12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
to speak about achieving high trust on a

13

budget

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,279
over the last two years i've been

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,520
project for ginger now headspace health

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,360
and in those two years i have had the

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,280
opportunity to work with a number of

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,360
different companies and ask about their

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,520
best practices

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680
my goal today is to distill all the

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
learnings and experiences that i had

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,600
over the last two years and distill

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,920
those in 10 bullet points for your

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,640

and this slides will be available after

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,439
the talk so you don't need to take any

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,439
pictures unless you really feel need to

43
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,840
do so

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,600
so what are the goals for today what are

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,360
we going to speak about in the next 40

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,200
to 45 minutes

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,280
so my goal is to give you some guidance

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,799
on how to prepare for high test

49
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,799
assessment on a budget and in a timely

50
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,119
manner

51
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,040
i have seen companies spending more than

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,720
three hundred thousand dollars and is

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,280
still managed to fail the certifications

54
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,960
and we at ginger and many other

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,960
companies have achieved similar in less

56
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,719
than hundred thousand dollars we and we

57
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,119
were able to pass this certification

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,880
so my goal is to give you some guidance

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
on how to reduce your budget what are

60
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,159
the open source tools that you can use

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,520
to keep your budget within hundred

62
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,799
thousand dollars

63
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,440
and when i say in a timely manner it's

64
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
within a year or 11 months like we did

65
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,599
at ginger

66
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,280
the other goal that i have for the talk

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,879
today is to give you some guidance on

68
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,040
initiating successful organization-wide

69
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,120
security programs and

70
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,480
cross-functional projects between

71
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,040
technical compliance teams

72
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,760
from my experience of working with the

73
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,599
different teams there is always this

74
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,599
dichotomy between the engineering teams

75
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,599
and the compliance teams and they don't

76
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,080
speak the same language so my goal today

77
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
is to give you some guidance and bullets

78
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,959
which will help you

79
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,560
speak the same language and be on the

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,680
same page

81
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,319
for your high test assessment

82
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,400
and lastly i would like to give you some

83
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,200
guidance on tools that we used at ginger

84
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,280
and headspace health that will help you

85
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,959
alleviate some of the budget pain that

86
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,239
you will face in your height journey

87
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,800
with those goals a couple of assumptions

88
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,159
as well

89
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,159
now i'm assuming that you have some

90
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,840
familiarity with high trust but don't

91
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,360
know where to start

92
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
and what i mean by that is you know how

93
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,840
to do this scoping you know how to

94
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,360
reach out to the external assessor you

95
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,760
already finalized an extra assessor but

96
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
you don't know where to start to keep

97
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,360
the budget down and start the the

98
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,920
process of high trust

99
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,519
the other assumption that i have is you

100
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,280
have limited resource in terms of

101
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,760
operational cost and time and like i

102
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,360
mentioned earlier as well one of the

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
goals of today's talk is to keep the

104
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
budget within hundred thousand dollars

105
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,200
and the run time to be less than a year

106
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,959
which brings to my third assumption that

107
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,200
you have at least a year between now and

108
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,680
your high-test external audit

109
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,519
if you don't have an year between now

110
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,360
and your external high-test audit which

111
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,440
is going to be with your assessor

112
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,599
it's going to be hard to replicate all

113
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,400
the learnings from the from the slides

114
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,480
if you have a few quarters between now

115
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
and your high test assessment you may

116
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
leverage some of the learnings from this

117
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,319
but the ideal scenario would be you are

118
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,159
planning your high-terrest external

119
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,080
validated assessment sometime this year

120
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
in 2023

121
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,439
and lastly ginger headspace health we

122
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,840
are always a sas first company and all

123
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,439
the learnings that we had were on the

124
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,000
same lines so i'm hoping that you also

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,519
had a similar learnings or you have a

126
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,279
similar infrastructure where your

127
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,000
infrastructure is heavily relied on sas

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,479
we at ginger headspace health never

129
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,960
almost never go for on-prem services we

130
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,880
look for services which are sas based

131
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,320
and they can do all the security stuff

132
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,320
for us and we can do their due diligence

133
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,280
now why high trust why not to speak

134
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,680
about stock 2 or why not speak about iso

135
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,880
27001 which are in this similar space

136
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
and when we were deliberating which

137
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
assessment we should be doing we came up

138
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,280
with these these three uh pillars for

139
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,800
hydras that i think are extremely

140
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,080
important to learn and understand

141
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,639
in high trust what you can do is you can

142
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,280
have multiple authoritative sources so

143
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,440
for example if you are a healthcare

144
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,680
company like us you can have hipaa in

145
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,120
your scope

146
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,360
if you are a company based in california

147
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,680
you can have ccp in your scope

148
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
if you are based in the uk as well or

149
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,919
you are you need to comply with gdpr you

150
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,560
can have gdpr uniscope and similarly if

151
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,680
you have a pci if your payment processor

152
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,479
you can have pci in your scope

153
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,000
so rather than having all these

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,440
different certifications that i have

155
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,400
seen many companies do what

156
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,720
one hydra certification and when you'll

157
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,800
be doing your scoping you can have all

158
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,960
of these in your regulatory factors

159
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,520
and what hytrus does it does all the

160
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
hard work for you

161
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,320
and gives you

162
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,639
the controls list of controls that you

163
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,960
need to comply with to comply with all

164
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,560
these different authoritative sources

165
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,479
the second reason that we chose high

166
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,199
trust and not iso or soc2 is it goes

167
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,360
beyond the ci triad

168
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,720
from my fair share of experience

169
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,880
is that it's very catered towards the

170
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,520
security logical hr controls and it

171
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,280
doesn't necessarily speak about the

172
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
privacy about the regulations about the

173
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,440
compliance in different industries so

174
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
for example

175
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,319
unless until you are going for stock 2

176
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,720
plus hipa there is no way you need to

177
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,120
have you you can get certified for hipaa

178
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
as well

179
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,520
so if

180
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,880
you want to comply with privacy

181
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,240
standards as well then you have to go

182
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,960
for iso 27017 which is

183
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,039
a different standard altogether

184
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,800
so this was the second reason we chose

185
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,440
high trust and not the the other

186
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,759
standards that are in the industry

187
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,479
and last but not the least is scope is

188
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,319
paramount in high terrest

189
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,360
i have seen some companies who just

190
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,199
don't feel the need to have the critical

191
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,560
systems in a scope

192
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,199
and when you speak

193
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,280
so you can say this is outside our of

194
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,520
our soa or we are not storing any

195
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,440
confidential information there and

196
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
you'll be all good you don't need to

197
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,160
worry about having those critical

198
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,479
systems in a scope

199
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,800
but in high trust the first thing that

200
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,960
you will do with your excel assessor is

201
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,360
to finalize this scope if your external

202
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,520
assessor is good they are going to ask

203
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,800
you a bunch of questions they are going

204
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,919
to help her held workshops with you

205
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,440
they are going to ask you how many

206
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,960
transitions are you processing what are

207
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
the number of interfaces that you have

208
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,880
how many systems do you have in a scope

209
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,160
where are you storing confidential

210
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
information do you have any offices in

211
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,400
the other regions where we want to get

212
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,680
compliance with

213
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,160
and all of these adds up to the cost and

214
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,680
number of controls in your high test

215
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,520
assessment so this is extremely

216
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,120
important to discuss with your external

217
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,840
assessor that what's the exact scope of

218
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,560
your high terrest

219
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,520
a bit about ginger's high test journey

220
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,160
so i joined ginger in january of 2020

221
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,440
and i took a couple of months to

222
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
understand the systems and the processes

223
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,960
and policies that we had

224
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,599
and then from may to april uh we did our

225
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,280
gap assessment

226
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
we took over that quarter to perform the

227
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,199
gap assessment ginger and then from may

228
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,280
to august we did the gap remediation

229
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,879
which is equally important piece of high

230
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,240
test

231
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,879
in september to december of 2020 we did

232
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,039
the audit interviews we asked our

233
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,120
external assistant to come and speak to

234
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,639
our different teams

235
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,199
we submitted all the evidences and in

236
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,240
february of 2021 we were able to receive

237
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
our final validated certification from

238
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,720
high test

239
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,599
and a bit about high test metrics as

240
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,680
well so like i mentioned earlier high

241
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,080
trust is extremely prescriptive and it

242
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,280
requires a lot and lot of evidences

243
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,799
so when we submitted our height

244
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,760
assessment and we did this analysis we

245
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,000
realized that we submitted more than

246
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,760
1200 pieces of evidences to high trust

247
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,800
we created modified reviewed more than

248
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,839
400 pages of policies and procedures

249
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,279
that in turn

250
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,519
led to 42 different policies procedures

251
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
and documentation for for

252
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,600
and lastly uh talk about zoom fatigue we

253
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,440
held

254
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,600
186 meetings between internalistic and

255
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,560
external stakeholders

256
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,399
142 of those meetings were with internal

257
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,920
stakeholders and when i say internal

258
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
stakeholders those are the teams in

259
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,800
engineering sales legal compliance

260
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,000
privacy

261
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,640
and 42 were with external stakeholders

262
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,160
so just like

263
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,240
you have internal stakeholders you will

264
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,640
have to reach out to aws who is your is

265
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
provider or something similar

266
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,480
you will have to have meetings with your

267
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
external assessor who will be doing the

268
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,200
audits

269
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,519
you will need to have some meetings with

270
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,600
the hires themselves to get the

271
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,120
subscription and make sure that you are

272
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,560
having the right subscription and number

273
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,880
of users for your myself portal

274
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,160
and so on so forth so we held 186

275
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,519
meetings uh

276
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,120
at the peak of zoom fatigue

277
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,560
a few more metrics so

278
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,080
when we started this journey of high

279
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,160
trust we were at 180 89 190 people

280
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,200
across ginger head special

281
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
across ginger not head special

282
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,640
and

283
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
33 of those team members actively

284
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
participated in certification in some

285
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
way or the other

286
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,279
so effectively one sixth of the entire

287
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,880
company was participating in high

288
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,120
terrest in some way or the other

289
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,200
we implemented seven tools to fill the

290
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,279
gaps that we realized in our

291
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,839
implementation domain and then we

292
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,920
started 10 security projects for our

293
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,880
high risk assessment

294
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,920
okay enough of the back story

295
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,519
jumping before jumping into the talk

296
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,200
just wanted to give you this breakdown

297
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,800
of police processes tools and

298
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,240
documentation

299
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,040
so

300
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,959
the next 10 points i tried to break

301
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,720
those between processes tools and

302
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,040
documentation so that you can delegate

303
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,880
accordingly who are responsible for

304
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,120
these species if somebody is responsible

305
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,880
for processes you can reach out to them

306
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,839
and so on so forth

307
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,800
so the first bullet that i learned from

308
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,200
my conversations and my experiences is

309
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,279
you need to perform the gap assessment

310
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,399
intimidation yourself

311
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,800
when you outsource the gap assessment

312
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,959
and remediation you are not only

313
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,360
outsourcing this piece of the audit you

314
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,120
are also outsourcing the relationships

315
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,480
you are going to build with different

316
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,920
teams when you will do this exercise

317
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,120
with them

318
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
you're also going to outsource learning

319
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
all the processes and the tools that

320
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,440
they have implemented in their systems

321
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,320
and

322
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,000
last but not the least you are going to

323
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,760
pay a lot of money to external assessors

324
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,519
gap assessment ideally what the

325
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,519
companies do or the external assessor do

326
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,200
they charge you by the number of main

327
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,519
days which is equivalent to the number

328
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,800
of controls that you'll have in your

329
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,279
scope and if you have a large scope like

330
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,600
we had it's going to charge upwards of

331
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
fifty thousand or sixty thousand dollars

332
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,279
for the gap assessment remediation

333
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
itself

334
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,720
so this is my first uh

335
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,839
idea to get the the budget in in uh

336
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,360
within hundred thousand dollars and keep

337
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
it timely

338
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,720
and how to do that so

339
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,639
you can leverage my csf for doing your

340
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,200
gap assessment intimidation yourself

341
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,920
so if you have a subscription of my csf

342
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
what you can do is once you have the

343
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,519
scoping done

344
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,600
you can download all the controls from

345
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,880
my csf

346
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,440
and you can have those controls in the

347
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,680
google sheet or something similar and

348
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
what you can do is you can plan your gap

349
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,880
assessment remediation accordingly

350
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,200
once you do that you can have the google

351
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,440
sheet with responsible team efforts

352
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,560
number of

353
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,399
controls that you have and then have the

354
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,760
timelines as well

355
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
which will become extremely helpful for

356
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,440
you when you do your remediation

357
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,480
now this is just a quick snapshot of how

358
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,399
we conducted the gap assessment at

359
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,600
ginger

360
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,440
so as you can see in the first column we

361
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,600
have all the domains listed and in the

362
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,839
subsequent tabs i have all the controls

363
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,920
that we needed and for each of the

364
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,600
domains i have the start date and the

365
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,279
end date with the timeline and the

366
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,880
status for all the domains

367
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
once you do this you will start speaking

368
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,880
to your different teams and ask about

369
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,320
the illustrative procedures that you

370
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,160
have implemented or that you need to

371
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,360
implement

372
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
and after you are done with the entire

373
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,519
size of gap assessment

374
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,680
you can have this sheet which will give

375
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,000
you what do you need to do so after you

376
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,839
did the gap assessment you can have the

377
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,079
gap remediation done here also we

378
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,760
followed this similar process we had

379
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,160
column with all the domains and then for

380
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,959
policies procedures implemented measured

381
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,480
and managed

382
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,040
how many gaps did we identify

383
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
once we identified those gaps we had the

384
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,880
start date and the end date and then the

385
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,880
timelines and the status and this

386
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,040
becomes extremely useful when you have

387
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
to submit your evidences as well

388
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,639
because what you're going to do is to

389
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,120
download all the controls from my csf

390
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,360
with their illustrator procedures and

391
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,880
you are going to compare each of those

392
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
illustrative procedures with the

393
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,560
controls that you have implemented if

394
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,480
you don't have any of those you can

395
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,240
track those in this spreadsheet and that

396
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,680
should serve as a good remediation

397
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,079
exercise for you

398
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,000
if you can take one thing from the

399
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,079
entire presentation this should be it

400
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,920
you you need to do the gap assessment

401
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,360
remediation yourself

402
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,120
to to build those relationships and keep

403
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,760
the cost down

404
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,560
the second guidance that i have is to

405
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,480
make sure that you have high trust part

406
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,040
of your information security program

407
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
now high trust is extremely prescriptive

408
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,639
and every single thing that you're doing

409
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,639
in your company right now or you want to

410
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,320
do in your company right now can be tied

411
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,639
back to the high test project

412
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,480
if you're implementing any tools please

413
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,240
make sure that you are having that tied

414
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,480
back to the csf domain if you're

415
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,800
starting a new project for your ssd or

416
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,279
dsd or stlc whatever it may be make sure

417
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,480
that it's tied back to the

418
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,040
give you a couple of examples for annual

419
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
risk assessment which i believe every

420
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,320
company does

421
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,720
there's this entire domain domain number

422
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,680
17 in my csf that you can download

423
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,320
or you can download

424
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,000
along with the prescriptions that what

425
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,360
even if you're doing the annual risk

426
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,440
assessment what you need to do is just

427
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,920
to extend that a bit so that you have

428
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,720
the prescriptions from my csf and then

429
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
you are doing your annual assessment in

430
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,760
accordance with the prescriptive

431
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,399
guidance from

432
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,720
similarly for vendor management i'm

433
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,199
pretty sure all companies do this but if

434
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,360
you identify that you have some gaps in

435
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,279
your vendor management make sure that

436
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,880
you're using the vendor uh the

437
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,800
prescription from domain number 14 which

438
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
is the third party assurance

439
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,720
for penetration test uh if you're

440
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
conducting penetration test or one

441
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,079
liberty assessments make sure that

442
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,759
you're having the prescriptive guidance

443
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,959
from

444
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,440
my csf which is domain number seven

445
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,519
vulnerability management and just to

446
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,079
give you an example uh when we did the

447
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,160
pen test or when we started this project

448
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,800
titus project we did not have a proper

449
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,480
liberty management program

450
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,880
so we took the guidance from my csf and

451
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,120
we started that entire program for us

452
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
which helped a lot in our

453
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,079
submitting the evidences and so on

454
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,639
and lastly for deletion requests

455
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,399
if you are processing customer or member

456
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,160
deletion requests please make sure that

457
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,519
you are taking the guidance from domain

458
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,240
number 19 which is data privacy and you

459
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,800
are uh having all the the guidance from

460
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,959
from my csf on how to process the

461
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,959
deletion request how to track the

462
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,199
timelines and everything that can be

463
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,079
uh done to cater to such requests

464
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,399
all of that is available from high trust

465
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,120
now

466
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,880
these are just a few examples and i

467
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,240
would highly recommend you check the

468
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,959
other domains as well i'm pretty sure

469
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,399
you are doing all of these things in

470
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,519
your company but you are

471
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,279
the third bullet that i have is initiate

472
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,040
an organization-wide security awareness

473
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
program now

474
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,240
we all know

475
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,000
the security awareness trainings that we

476
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,720
do

477
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,639
within 30 days of onboarding and then

478
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,399
annually thereafter

479
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,120
but

480
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,079
to have the hydra certification

481
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:02,880
done

482
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
you have to have a security awareness

483
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,799
program and not a training there's

484
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,039
there's a major difference between both

485
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,119
and if you're a fan fan of isaka just

486
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,400
like me

487
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,880
this in all their books that executive

488
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,959
sponsorship is the most important thing

489
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,880
to have the

490
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,000
height certification done

491
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,760
i'm done

492
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
but i believe

493
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,480
for high trust the individual buy-in and

494
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,559
support is more important than the

495
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,840
executive sponsorship

496
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,799
pieces of evidences from this different

497
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,760
teams so it becomes a lot on their

498
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
if you have their buy-in

499
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,080
so at ginger what we did was we started

500
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,919
this program called security insider

501
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:00,799
program

502
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,440
with volunteers from each team

503
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,080
so rather than we

504
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,760
somebody forcing somebody to give us the

505
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,799
evidences we wanted them to be a part of

506
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,520
the hydras project and we have that um

507
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,120
done by is starting this program

508
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,360
security insider program and they were

509
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
an extension of the security team and

510
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,960
not a different team who were working on

511
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,919
their own

512
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,600
we trained them on different security

513
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,679
controls we trained them on tracking the

514
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,600
shadow i.t apps we train them on

515
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,520
becoming application admins for

516
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,000
applications which are not managed by it

517
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,559
or security

518
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,320
which is a satisfication and they don't

519
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,840
support sso

520
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,000
your team can just go and

521
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,080
start

522
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,480
you will have no visibility into that

523
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,799
and that's extremely important to know

524
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,480
when you're having this this highly

525
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,640
relied infrastructure in sas

526
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,160
we trained them on role based access

527
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
control so they were responsible for

528
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,240
tracking the role-based uh controls or

529
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,760
role-based access for their their

530
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,760
so i know we all hate shared passwords

531
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,840
but there are some uh

532
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,120
websites that

533
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,600
you can't just help having shared

534
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,360
passwords

535
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,600
you

536
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,720
facebook if you have a marketing page

537
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,799
they don't have a separate account for

538
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,240
your admin and then non-admin

539
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,840
but how do you manage those passwords

540
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
when you have a team of three working on

541
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
this huge project along with all the

542
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,640
different things

543
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,799
uh you ask your security insiders you

544
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,559
train them you track those in google

545
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,640
sheets and similar to make sure that

546
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,799
those are all tracked and rotated when

547
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,280
required

548
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,760
this is something that i learned after

549
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,160
we achieved our certification

550
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,440
and this is a certification that is uh

551
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,000
provided by hypers themselves so i would

552
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,960
highly highly recommend get at least one

553
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,320
team member hydra ccp certified

554
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,679
csf is extremely rich functionality

555
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,120
complex to navigate

556
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,280
it seems that they are using some some

557
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,320
software from the from

558
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,280
but there's a lot of functionality and

559
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
you need to use all this functionality

560
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,960
for your sas services or for your

561
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,039
hydrist

562
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,280
so if you have infrastructure that is in

563
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,400
aws

564
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
azure or gcp

565
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,320
what you can do is you can inherit the

566
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,400
controls from them rather than having

567
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
all those controls implemented by

568
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,280
yourself

569
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,640
if you have a platform as a service

570
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,039
provider such as datica or similar you

571
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,559
can implement some of the controls from

572
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,400
them rather than implementing all those

573
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
controls by yourself

574
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,159
and what you need to do is to use the

575
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,480
inheritance functionality in high trust

576
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,120
to or my csf to inherit all those

577
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
controls

578
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
the second function is diary

579
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,039
so rather than having a lot of email

580
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,039
communication with your external

581
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,960
assessors on the guidance that they need

582
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,960
or the evidence that they need

583
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,880
what you can do is you can use this

584
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,280
diary function within mycsf and this

585
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,320
will allow you to have these

586
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,919
conversations directly with your

587
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,600
external assessors on that particular

588
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,520
control so rather than having those

589
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,080
email exchanges between the between your

590
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,760
teams and my csf uh folks and and the

591
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
external assessors you can have this

592
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,679
diary function which will be extremely

593
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,600
helpful to reduce that communication and

594
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,320
things get things done faster

595
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,480
and lastly delegation

596
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
if you know you have a different privacy

597
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,480
team altogether you can delegate the

598
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
entire domain to them if you have a

599
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,080
different vendor management domain you

600
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,039
can delegate the entire domain to them

601
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,720
and similarly there are a bunch of other

602
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,240
domains which are related to wireless

603
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,000
security which you can do into uh

604
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,880
dedicated to your itc id teams

605
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
removable media domains and so on so

606
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,240
forth which you can delegate to to

607
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,400
different teams so this is extremely

608
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,080
important to learn and understand that

609
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,159
how how do you make the most of your

610
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,720
your my csf tool

611
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,200
and lastly you need to understand the

612
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,559
scoring rubric

613
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,400
there is no way that you will be able to

614
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
pass the certification if you don't have

615
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,760
a good understanding and a good external

616
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
assessor with this scoring rubric

617
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,440
understanding

618
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,520
high trust recently changed their

619
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,360
scoring rubric they

620
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,520
in 2019 2020

621
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,039
they changed the scoring rubric of

622
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,360
policies procedures and implemented and

623
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,799
if you understand the scoring rubric

624
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,200
correctly what you can do is to focus on

625
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,840
things that are most important to you

626
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,480
rather than having a lot of efforts done

627
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,240
in the managed or measured you can

628
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
choose to have more efforts on the

629
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,720
policy side or more efforts in maturing

630
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,799
your procedures or more efforts in just

631
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,240
implementing these scores which is the

632
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
most important domain in high terrest

633
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,000
and all of that will be extremely

634
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,720
helpful if you understand the the

635
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,960
rubric and prisma methodology that high

636
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
test uses to to

637
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,799
mark the control requirements

638
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,360
lastly identify the inheritance controls

639
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,840
so this is something that we did at

640
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,440
ginger

641
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,679
for our aws which is ice provider as

642
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,760
well as datica which is our voice over

643
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,280
ps providers

644
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,760
and what you can do is you can leverage

645
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,840
the shared responsibility metrics from

646
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,600
high trust themselves

647
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,840
so you don't need to figure out what are

648
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,320
the controls that i can leverage for my

649
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,960
my csf for my my domains

650
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,679
hi trust has this extensive guidance

651
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,400
with the domain id the control id with

652
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,640
the percentage that you can inherit and

653
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,880
it's extremely helpful to have all of

654
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,280
this done and sorted before even before

655
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,480
you start your external assessment

656
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,039
for that what we did was we reached out

657
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,240
to aws and we had a soft approval even

658
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,720
before we started our high test journey

659
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,200
and we took the guidance from the shared

660
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,600
responsibility metrics we asked our

661
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,679
account manager aws account manager to

662
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:52,720
connect us with someone in the

663
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,080
compliance team

664
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,360
they connected us with somebody in the

665
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,799
compliance team we developed this

666
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,520
relationship and it so happened that

667
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,360
when we submitted the controls for their

668
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,720
soft approval

669
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,880
via email and google sheet they came

670
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
back saying that these are not the right

671
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,840
controls and you need to do some more

672
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,640
work

673
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,400
but since we had the relationship we

674
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,320
were able to get that done quickly we

675
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,840
were able to get them on the phone and

676
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,640
then

677
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,559
speak about how we can leverage the the

678
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,840
mycsf shared responsibility metrics and

679
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,400
all of that helped us a lot in

680
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,159
expediting that request

681
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,000
now please keep in mind that when you're

682
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
submitting this inheritance request to

683
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,600
to my csf uh in the in the portal

684
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,279
there are hundreds of different

685
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,440
companies who are submitting requests at

686
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,200
the same time they all want to get their

687
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,720
inheritance requests submitted and

688
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,320
approved as soon as possible from the

689
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,760
ies providers

690
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,520
but if you don't have that relationship

691
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
it may not get prioritized and this

692
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,480
might delay your your certification so

693
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,240
you want to make sure that you have all

694
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,640
those tools identified beforehand you

695
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,880
have controls identified beforehand and

696
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,640
then you have the soft approvals for

697
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,960
each of those

698
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,520
this is extremely important as well that

699
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,120
you need to include the technical

700
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,919
controls in sdlc

701
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,240
hi-trust has this policy procedure and

702
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
implemented and what they do

703
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,960
is they have different scores for each

704
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,120
and for some reason high trust pays a

705
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,960
lot more attention on the implemented

706
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,240
part

707
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,000
as i mentioned earlier as well there is

708
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
always this

709
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,520
dichotomy between the the engineering

710
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,039
team and the compliance teams and they

711
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,480
don't speak the same language and

712
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,919
sometimes you may not have some of the

713
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,440
tools implemented

714
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,880
so you need to make sure that you are

715
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,360
having all those tools in your stlc from

716
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,039
the very start or as soon as you can

717
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,120
there are some tools we don't use all

718
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,559
these tools at ginger these are just

719
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,720
examples that you can use open source

720
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
tools like defect dojo for your liberty

721
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,240
management if you don't have a project

722
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,720
management tool you can use osec which

723
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,880
is an open source tool for your hids and

724
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,120
extremely important control for for the

725
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,279
for the my csf

726
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,320
domain

727
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,720
you can use osap for your dst and you

728
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,159
can use github dependable for your

729
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,400
dependency issues so

730
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,320
just a sample of tools i have seen

731
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
companies using prometheus and grafana

732
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,080
for their log management and they were

733
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,120
able to use that as a source for their

734
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,360
high-test evidence i have seen companies

735
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,840
using vasu or snap it

736
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,360
for their asset management and log

737
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,120
management and they were able to pass

738
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,640
the hydra certification from that

739
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,679
evidence so tools regardless of what

740
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,240
tools you do plan to implement you need

741
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,320
to make sure that you are implementing

742
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,000
some of the tools

743
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,120
now having tools is one thing but please

744
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,440
make sure that you are having all those

745
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
guidance all these tickets in a project

746
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,880
management tool

747
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,640
high trust is

748
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,559
extremely

749
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,480
stringent in the in the evidence that

750
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,159
they require and if you have this

751
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,760
tickets and fixes in a project

752
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,679
management tool it will be extremely

753
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,080
easy for you to show these tools or show

754
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
these tickets to your external assessor

755
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,039
and then move from there

756
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,400
this one is pretty unique to our

757
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,000
infrastructure but i wanted to lay this

758
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,360
out as well

759
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,520
you have to implement a sas management

760
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,480
tool

761
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,520
if you are a sas based company like us

762
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,840
and you don't have a sas management tool

763
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,320
it becomes extremely difficult to cater

764
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,000
to those services

765
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,600
at one point

766
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,320
across all ginger we had 300 plus

767
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,799
applications across the environment of

768
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,559
course some of those were marketing

769
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,279
applications some of those were

770
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,919
just applications for brainstorming when

771
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,520
everybody had covered

772
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,880
but

773
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,720
there will be some applications where

774
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,600
you'll be storing your pii and phi and

775
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,080
if you don't have a proper understanding

776
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,399
of your sas environment it will be

777
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,720
extremely difficult to to keep track of

778
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,480
all these services

779
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,240
the second benefit of having a tool like

780
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,880
this is you can do your due diligence a

781
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
lot more efficiently

782
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,399
you can have your stock to reports

783
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,480
within the sas management tool you can

784
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,720
have the baas in the dpas within that

785
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,600
tool you can have business owners uh in

786
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,520
the in the sas management tool for each

787
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
of the applications you can have the

788
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,880
annual reviews for each of those

789
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,720
applications and who are the owners and

790
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,200
who are the users and so on so forth so

791
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,440
if you have a good sas management tool

792
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,000
it will alleviate a lot of your pain for

793
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,600
achieving high trust and not just

794
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,120
fighters but to maintain your i.t

795
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,720
of course the sas management tool is

796
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,559
useful in annual compliance review

797
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,159
monitoring tracking any corrective

798
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,520
action plans

799
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,760
data deletion and contact termination so

800
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,360
if you are terminating a contract with

801
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,200
one of the vendors you want to make sure

802
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
that you are receiving this alert from

803
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,640
from the service itself that you

804
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
terminated the contract you want them to

805
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,240
delete all your data that they hold for

806
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,880
you

807
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,159
this one again may some sound a bit

808
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,080
ubiquitous that everybody does that why

809
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,279
do we need to have electronically

810
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,279
approved documentation

811
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,399
but i have seen companies you lose their

812
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,480
marks because they did not have the

813
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,200
electronically approved documentation

814
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,120
now there are two things when you are

815
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,880
talking about approval or document or

816
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,799
policy procedure approval

817
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,960
one could be just an approval where you

818
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,520
have your change table or change history

819
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,480
table and you say yup this is the owner

820
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,080
this is the reviewer this is the

821
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,799
approver and we are all good and that

822
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,320
should be sufficient for your stock to

823
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
or iso

824
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,480
but for high trust they have something

825
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,120
called a bake period so if you don't

826
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,880
have a proper date on your high test

827
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,480
documentation in your policies and

828
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,600
procedures

829
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,960
they may not consider is a a as a proper

830
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,360
policy and procedure

831
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,279
for high trust currently the requirement

832
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,039
is you have to have your policies and

833
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,080
procedures approved electronically

834
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,919
before six days of your external

835
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,360
validated audit

836
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,919
you have to have the implementation done

837
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,080
before 90 days of your external

838
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,520
validated audit

839
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,520
and if you don't have this you might

840
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,600
lose some marks in your scoring rubric

841
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,320
that you really want to avoid

842
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
you can use services like docusign hello

843
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,880
sign adobe sign and all of that could be

844
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
could do the job of approval and seal

845
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,440
the document before the bake period of

846
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,320
60-90 days

847
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,159
if

848
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,000
you take the second slide from this

849
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,240
presentation this should be it

850
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,360
start with the relevant scope

851
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,880
i have seen companies expand their scope

852
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,360
so much that they had 100 and

853
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,440
8 800 plus controls in their high test

854
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,919
audit and it's extremely difficult to

855
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,240
have all those controls done within the

856
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,360
first iteration so ask your assessor if

857
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,320
your assessor is good they will ask you

858
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,039
to to tone down your scope to the

859
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,120
most important buildings and

860
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,880
infrastructure

861
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,480
a couple of examples

862
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,880
if you have office in san francisco you

863
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,559
have office in new york and your office

864
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,000
in london

865
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,159
but you your offices in london and new

866
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,120
york they don't have anyone doing any id

867
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,519
work they are just marketing people

868
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,679
doing their marketing jobs in the london

869
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,200
office they are just recording some

870
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,399
sound

871
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,399
do you really really want to have this

872
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,159
in the in the in the scope of your high

873
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,279
trust

874
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,919
ask your assessor would they be able to

875
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,240
have this removed from your scope for

876
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,000
the for the time being and you can try

877
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,399
to have them in the next iteration

878
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,320
but for your first

879
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,440
assessment

880
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,360
ask your assessor as many questions as

881
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,720
you can on turning down the scope

882
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,960
the second example is do you need all

883
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,559
the applications and business functions

884
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,600
in the scope

885
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,519
and again like i mentioned earlier at

886
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,919
one point we were using more than 300

887
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,399
plus applications at ginger

888
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,240
but we didn't

889
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,559
need all those applications to

890
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,240
provide services to our customers we are

891
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,720
not restoring any pii phi or any

892
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,919
confidential information in those

893
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,120
services

894
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,440
so ask your your assessor can you tone

895
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,679
down all those applications and only

896
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,240
focus on the the stuff that is most

897
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,519
important to you

898
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,519
and your customers and members

899
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,440
this this should be your first priority

900
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,840
after you decide on the scope

901
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,960
and lastly ask yourself can you obtain

902
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,799
the passing score without testing for

903
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,720
measured and managed

904
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,440
now high test has this this flexibility

905
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,080
that you can choose not to have measured

906
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
and managed in your scope

907
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,720
and what it does um

908
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,320
of the hundred passing points or the

909
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,000
hundred total points you can choose

910
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,480
policy procedure and implemented

911
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,240
and if you feel that you're confident

912
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,760
enough in all those three

913
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,519
you don't need to have measured and

914
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,519
managed in your scope you can just go

915
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,159
without them and send then get scored

916
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,159
out of those remaining

917
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,600
20 20 and 40 40 uh

918
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,440
i don't remember the exact percentage

919
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,279
but you can again test it from policy

920
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,880
processor implemented and not the

921
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,320
measured and managed

922
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,480
so ask your assessor but more

923
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,120
importantly ask yourself do you feel

924
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,960
confident enough to pass the

925
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,480
certification without having the

926
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,760
measured and managed in a scope

927
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,679
and lastly again this might sound

928
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,960
exactly like we do this all the time

929
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,799
but again i'll read it here that

930
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,200
document every single thing that you've

931
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,559
been doing

932
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,799
role changes termination requests

933
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,039
contractor onboarding and trainings

934
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,120
if you don't have an lms make sure that

935
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,399
your contractor trainings you are

936
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,919
tracking in a google sheet you are

937
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,679
asking for these screenshots when they

938
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,360
are completing the trainings

939
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
if you don't have an id system

940
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,600
make sure that you are asking for

941
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,000
emails when the owners send out the the

942
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,080
emails to terminate employees to the it

943
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,039
team

944
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,440
if you don't have a proper tool to track

945
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,519
the role changes make sure that you are

946
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,399
asking for email from from the

947
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,519
managers whom who is the the manager

948
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,120
right now and the lead manager who will

949
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,720
be doing who is going to be the next

950
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,279
manager to ask for this role changes

951
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,120
emails and notifications and all of

952
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,399
these will be extremely important when

953
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,840
you will do your your high trust

954
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,399
if you are doing any updates to policies

955
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,399
if you are evaluating any tools make

956
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,240
sure that you have a business case you

957
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,239
have a comparison you have the business

958
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,320
case approved from somebody in the in

959
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,119
the team like a senior manager you have

960
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,918
the budget approved for for the tool

961
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,079
if you're disposing or wiping any assets

962
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,760
make sure that you are at least

963
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,839
maintaining a google sheet extremely

964
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,480
important to to have this done as well

965
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,560
if you are processing deletion requests

966
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,679
for

967
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,359
ccp and gdpr make sure that you are

968
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,280
tracking all of those as well

969
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,199
if you are conducting penetration test

970
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,040
vulnerability management make sure that

971
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,960
you have all those limitations

972
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,719
documented as well

973
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,599
all of these will play a huge huge role

974
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,280
in your high test evidence collection

975
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,040
when you will be in that phase

976
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,879
a couple of things like i mentioned

977
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,000
maybe if you're attending this

978
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,280
conference

979
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,119
document this if somebody is acting a

980
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,440
new certification document that that

981
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,960
will be a part of your workforce

982
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,040
development plan control which is like a

983
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,079
50 or 20 odd controls in domain burn so

984
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,599
document all of these as well that you

985
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,440
attended this talk or you did the the

986
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,440
rsa conference or you have this budget

987
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,560
for for employees to do these

988
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,839
certifications

989
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,680
all of that will come extremely handy

990
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,839
and even for your internal training so

991
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,640
if you have a training for the incident

992
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,680
response

993
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
make sure that you have the

994
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
video recordings for that make sure that

995
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,079
you have the the email notifications out

996
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,079
for that and the calendar invites and

997
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,040
then

998
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,560
all of that stuff will be extremely

999
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720
handy for different domains and and you

1000
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,240
need to track each of those

1001
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,680
okay so so to to summarize uh be

1002
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,359
proactive in your communication with

1003
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,720
internal and external stakeholders again

1004
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,640
when i say internal stakeholders these

1005
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,960
are your legal teams your compliance

1006
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,599
teams your privacy teams engineering

1007
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,119
marketing hr people ops

1008
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,079
talent

1009
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,599
because they will be

1010
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,240
doing the the jd uh for security folks

1011
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,680
so make sure that you are proactive in

1012
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,960
your communication and what's the

1013
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,359
requirement for for this uh

1014
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,119
uh hydra certification

1015
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,599
and then be equally proactive with the

1016
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,200
external stakeholder expectations as

1017
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,520
well be extremely proactive in

1018
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,079
communicating with aws if you are using

1019
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,520
aws

1020
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,280
be proactive in communicating with high

1021
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,839
trust or your external assessor and all

1022
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,240
of those will pay in leaps and bounds

1023
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,599
when you'll be in your external audit

1024
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,440
phase

1025
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,760
the second summary that i have is agree

1026
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,839
on the minimum required scope with your

1027
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,599
external assessor

1028
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,920
this is extremely important to keep the

1029
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,720
cost down and more importantly keep the

1030
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,640
budget end time down

1031
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,800
all of those will pay a part in your

1032
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,480
external assessment when you do the the

1033
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,240
audits so make sure that you agree on

1034
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,480
the minimum required scope at least for

1035
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,040
your first iteration

1036
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,720
and lastly make use of fighters

1037
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,000
illustrative procedures for your

1038
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,400
information security program hytrust has

1039
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,000
this

1040
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,359
very very prescriptive procedures of for

1041
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,599
each of the controls on what they need

1042
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,079
so make sure that you are using them to

1043
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,560
the most of your abilities and you are

1044
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,720
tracking those all the way for each of

1045
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,880
the each of the bullets and domains

1046
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,119
this will be helpful for you when you

1047
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,320
will do the gap assessment and

1048
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,440
deterioration and move forward from

1049
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,680
there

1050
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,079
and this is the third most important

1051
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,400
slide from my presentation

1052
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,040
high trust is not a sprint

1053
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,359
definitely not a marathon but a 5000

1054
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,359
meter relay and i would like to explain

1055
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,599
that a bit as well why why i chose that

1056
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,359
statement

1057
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,359
if you are doing an assessment like

1058
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,320
stock tour iso you can get it done once

1059
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,400
and then you don't need to to work on

1060
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,640
that again and again stock2 is valid for

1061
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,800
two years and you don't need to have the

1062
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,599
the

1063
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,040
or benefit for one year but you don't

1064
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,119
need to to do a lot of stuff in that

1065
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,520
if you think of high-test as a marathon

1066
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,599
but marathon is a one-player game and

1067
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,200
you cannot win high-test with a

1068
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,119
one-player game even if you're willing

1069
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,240
to run 42 kilometers alone it will not

1070
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,640
serve the purpose of high trust you have

1071
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,720
to have the buy-in from different teams

1072
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,640
because ultimately they will be the ones

1073
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,160
supporting you at the end of the

1074
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,960
document at the end of the audit and

1075
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,200
providing all the evidences and helping

1076
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,880
you with with the with the uh

1077
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,720
volunteering for the security team and

1078
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,200
so on so forth so it's definitely not a

1079
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,359
marathon you have to have the support

1080
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,119
from different teams

1081
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,359
and the last piece is it's a 5000 meter

1082
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,960
relay so

1083
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,800
it's not a thousand meter relay you have

1084
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,200
to put in some efforts it's a 5 000

1085
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,880
meter relay where you will have to have

1086
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,960
a bunch of players supporting you to win

1087
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,720
the race

1088
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,280
you as a team will be working with

1089
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,599
different teams internally those are

1090
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,440
some of the participants in your relay

1091
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,839
you will be working with aws or your ism

1092
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,160
ps providers they are one participant in

1093
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,480
your relay you will be speaking to your

1094
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,079
external assessors who are a whole

1095
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,240
different entity and they will be

1096
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,320
they'll be helping you out a lot in the

1097
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,240
in the journey and then lastly the

1098
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,839
hikers themselves so if you have a good

1099
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,599
relationship with high trust they can

1100
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,680
get you with on the phone and they will

1101
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,200
solve a lot of your issues like

1102
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,480
uploading the

1103
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,160
evidences towards the end or doing the

1104
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,680
offline upload and

1105
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,960
you will get to all of that when you

1106
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,839
will submit your mycsf final assessment

1107
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,079
but again i just want to reiterate that

1108
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,520
this statement that

1109
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,000
high trust is not a sprint uh definitely

1110
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,400
not a marathon but a 5000 meter relay so

1111
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,200
be be prepared for that

1112
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,760
uh that's all i have my again my contact

1113
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,160
details are here the grc musics.com i

1114
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,400
like to write a lot about my work and

1115
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,240
philosophy and whatever it may be my

1116
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,400
running adventures and so on so forth uh

1117
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,839
you can always reach out to me at show

1118
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,400
with ginger at i o and i can i can share

1119
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,280
the

1120
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,680
the excel sheets with you from

1121
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,760
after update updating so approval and

1122
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,160
then my linkedin is show with mata and

1123
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,680
the slides are available here so bit.ly

1124
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,839
and the code next to it is case

1125
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,720
sensitive so the second s

1126
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,040
is uh a capital s and and you need to

1127
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,880
make sure that you are putting the right

1128
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,280
uh code in there

1129
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,839
that's all i have i'll i'll open it for

1130
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,400
any questions comments

1131
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,480
sure so the question is did we

1132
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,560
strategically strategically choose not

1133
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,599
to have policies procedures implemented

1134
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,680
as well not to have those

1135
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,920
because of the time or effort constraint

1136
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,599
and the answer is no

1137
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,440
for our first iteration we did not have

1138
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
measured and managed so we were heavily

1139
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,520
relying on those three domains policies

1140
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,160
procedures and implemented and since we

1141
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,839
did not use any external assessors for

1142
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,079
our gap assessment and remediation we

1143
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,760
wanted to make sure that we make the

1144
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,480
most of what we are going for

1145
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,040
and for that if we strategically choose

1146
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,200
not to have something from policy

1147
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,680
procedure or implemented it may come

1148
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,240
adversely on us towards the end that we

1149
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,319
did not have this and now we are failing

1150
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,079
because you did not have that in the

1151
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,040
beginning

1152
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,839
so even though we had to put in a lot of

1153
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,760
effort and implement a lot of tools we

1154
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,200
did all of that

1155
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,599
at least for those three domains and

1156
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,680
like i mentioned we we developed a lot

1157
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,319
of procedure documentation 42 of those

1158
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,920
including policies so we we did do a

1159
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,839
very thorough job on those three domains

1160
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,720
they

1161
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,400
so the official guidance is they changed

1162
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,280
it changed at least every year

1163
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,800
that's the official guidance that they

1164
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,640
have so they are recently coming up with

1165
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,040
or they recently came up with 9.6 which

1166
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,119
is a minor iteration and they are

1167
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,040
planning to release uh

1168
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,280
version 10 sometime in the in the near

1169
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,599
future but for the official guidance

1170
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,079
they do want to have this updated at

1171
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,040
least on an annual basis uh and they may

1172
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,800
not necessarily change all the controls

1173
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,560
themselves they might add some

1174
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,520
authoritative sources so even if you're

1175
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,480
on version 9.3 you don't necessarily

1176
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,520
need to go to version 9.6

1177
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,359
if you're not going for those external

1178
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,119
authenticative sources you can just

1179
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,760
relay on 9.3 and that should serve the

1180
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,119
purpose of your hydrostatic

1181
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,240
yeah i have two examples that i want to

1182
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,400
speak about the first one that we use at

1183
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
ginger so of course of course a

1184
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,520
disclaimer no no

1185
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,040
sponsorship or nothing like that but we

1186
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,839
use blissfully at ginger which is

1187
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,359
extremely helpful to manage all the

1188
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,640
services

1189
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,599
the best part about using blissfully is

1190
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,920
it scans all the domains or all the

1191
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,319
emails and then it gives you

1192
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,400
all like an overview of how many

1193
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,319
applications do you have

1194
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,160
and who are the users using those

1195
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,160
applications how often are you having

1196
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,839
those applications used

1197
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,359
who are the users

1198
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,119
do you need to do any vendor approvals

1199
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,119
and so on so forth so there are there

1200
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,560
are a bunch of functionalities and they

1201
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,319
recently merged with another company

1202
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,800
called vendor v e and dr so if you have

1203
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,560
a type of vendor you can get blissfully

1204
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,680
for free which is again a good thing

1205
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,119
the other application that i want to

1206
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,000
speak about is app omni uh they are

1207
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,640
pretty good but the only issue that i

1208
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,160
have with them is they don't do the

1209
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,599
discovery part so like i mentioned

1210
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,480
blissfully scans all the gmail emails

1211
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,599
and then it will give you like a

1212
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,000
an overview of all the applications but

1213
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
app only cannot do that you have to

1214
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,920
input the applications manually and once

1215
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,680
you input the applications then it will

1216
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,839
cascade to different

1217
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,160
sectors at what for example slack what

1218
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,839
bots do you have on slack

1219
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,359
for

1220
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,520
gmail what plugins do you have on gmail

1221
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,359
but it will not discover the

1222
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,119
applications itself which i think is

1223
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,720
extremely important for a sas management

1224
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,640
tool

1225
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,200
exactly yep

1226
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,359
yeah yeah great question we had a few

1227
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,119
creative action plans we had around 10

1228
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,119
on our procedures so i think that's

1229
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,040
something that we needed to work on like

1230
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,119
i mentioned we did not use any external

1231
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,640
assessor for their guidance or

1232
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,359
consultancy and that's why we we lacked

1233
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,359
in in the procedures bit

1234
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,480
we did not

1235
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,160
have enough procedures for our disposal

1236
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,560
of ide and and some of the things that

1237
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,480
that are pretty common we were doing all

1238
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,319
of that but we did have some corrective

1239
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,760
action plans so we had to work on those

1240
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,839
for our interim assessment so i'm not

1241
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,359
sure if you're familiar but if you're

1242
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,880
doing your interim assessment then you

1243
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,680
have to have all those caps remediated

1244
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,480
along with one domain one control from

1245
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,880
each domain so we had that all of that

1246
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,960
done in interim and we were able to get

1247
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,920
the interim letter as well

1248
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,920
yeah good

1249
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,520
assumptions um uh heavily

1250
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,440
doing fast applications um

1251
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,960
yeah so the question is do i have any

1252
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,640
recommendations for

1253
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,400
folks who have a lot of on-prem

1254
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,680
infrastructure they don't have a lot of

1255
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,800
sas

1256
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,960
i i believe all the the bullets that i

1257
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,920
hit will help you in in that scenario as

1258
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,079
well the only thing is you will need to

1259
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,440
manage your enthalpy structure

1260
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,760
infrastructure

1261
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,880
yourself

1262
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,560
and if you are willing to do that and

1263
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,800
you have the capacity to do that i think

1264
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,240
all of these will be applicable for that

1265
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,119
as well

1266
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,640
we when we started this journey of

1267
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,319
high-tested ginger we were only three

1268
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,040
folks we might see so and and our one

1269
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,119
more id person and of course our data

1270
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,280
privacy officer so we had

1271
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,520
very limited understanding and we had

1272
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,480
very limited time for for with us to to

1273
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,240
conduct all of that

1274
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,040
so we did the best we could and uh

1275
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,359
we were heavily led on sas so we

1276
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,800
implemented a sas management tool and

1277
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,599
that served us really well

1278
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,720
yep

1279
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,480
is

1280
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,839
yeah

1281
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,079
yeah so the question is uh some of the

1282
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,559
language in hyderabad csf is pretty big

1283
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,079
and is there a

1284
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,839
way we can try to figure out the exact

1285
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,839
control requirement behind that vague

1286
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:37,040
language

1287
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,920
and i would say if you have such

1288
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,839
issues the first source would be to go

1289
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,000
with your external assessor and then ask

1290
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,559
them what do they need to get the

1291
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,920
requirement done

1292
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,680
the second thing that you can do is to

1293
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,760
see the source itself so if you go to

1294
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,319
high test website you can download mycsf

1295
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,119
and you will be able to see each of the

1296
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,440
frameworks as well so for this uh

1297
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,200
control where you say we have network

1298
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,720
activity session to be closed or after

1299
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,920
period of time

1300
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,240
hiters will give you the exact framework

1301
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,400
from where they picked the language and

1302
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,559
you can search for this specific control

1303
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,720
in that framework itself and see what's

1304
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,079
the requirement do you really need to

1305
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,760
have those session closed or this is

1306
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,040
something that you can work around with

1307
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,880
your external assessor saying this is

1308
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,920
not even applicable to us so i i would i

1309
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,680
would say the first source would be your

1310
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,359
external assessor and if you're not

1311
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,880
satisfied with their answer then would

1312
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,400
you rather want to go to the source

1313
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,200
itself that which is the which is the

1314
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,480
uh source for this control within my csf

1315
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,880
because my csv is nothing but like a

1316
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,960
combination of all these these different

1317
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,839
authoritative sources

1318
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,960
yeah yeah that's a great question so the

1319
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,480
question is there on the high test

1320
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,760
itself they have different level of

1321
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,079
controls 11th world level 2 and level 3.

1322
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,680
and sometimes they they ask you to

1323
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,359
implement level 3 sometimes they're okay

1324
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,520
with level 2. and of course i would say

1325
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,680
speak with your external assessor they

1326
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,760
should be the ones guiding you on which

1327
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,119
level of controls that you would need

1328
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,359
sometimes

1329
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,240
i can speak for ginger we were

1330
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,000
extremely good on implemented so even

1331
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,599
though for controls which only required

1332
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,599
level two we went for level three

1333
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,520
implementation and because we did not

1334
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,400
want to lose any of those marks and we

1335
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,319
did not even know about that only i did

1336
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,200
the uh the myself or ccsf certification

1337
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,960
myself so

1338
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,240
for ginger it did not matter to us a lot

1339
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,400
which level of control it was because we

1340
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,640
