19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
resetting things we want to return to

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,040
the basics

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,559
you know so specifically security b

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,800
sites core tenants are community

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,960
collaboration and education so we really

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,320
want to focus on those kind of key

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,879
things um as we close out

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,039
the last day of the event

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,199
this event is and will always be

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,840
centered on community so just super

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
excited that we can

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
once again bring this community back

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
together in person

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,280

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,799

some things are not working as as great

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000
as they are um we are a 100 volunteer

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,320
organized team and the last two years

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,520
have been very brutal to all of us um so

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,840
we really appreciate uh all the leeway

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,920
there but yeah we we do this because

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,280
it's it's the event is put on by and for

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,960
the community

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,040
there's about 25 staffers that work

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
about year round to put this on

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,159
we have an amazing um

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,560
call for a call for papers committee

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,079
team that also reviews all the

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,320
submissions and our capture the flag

48
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,920
team spends a lot of time rebuilding the

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,759
uh all the challenges every year so

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,560
they're fresh every single year

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,360
plus a large number of volunteers

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,799
that we would not be able to make this

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,759

145
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
very trying

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,520

team

149
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,520
we've had several of our staff that

150
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
actually just moved outside the sf bay

151
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,560
area

152
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,880
in fact two of our staffers are actually

153
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,639
flew in that they moved away during the

154
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,720
event and then flew back just to help us

155
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,000

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,320
area

158
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,479

00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,039
registered

172
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,960
it's that show respect and tolerance for

173
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
each other's uniqueness be kind and

174
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,360
practice the golden rule

175
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,720
simply put

176
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,199
do not be an ass or kick your ass out

177
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,280
so again absolutely zero tolerance for

178
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
physical verbal

179
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,319
or sexual harassment intimidation or

180
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,560
marginalization of any human

181
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,280
or robot i guess as well

182
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,520
but if you have an issue or witness uh

183
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
any of behavior that's not consistent

184
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,360
with this policy uh let any of the

185
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,639
radioed staff

186
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,800
know about it or any of our safety ops

187
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,720
volunteers and we'll get it addressed

188
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
promptly

189
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,600
for the full code of conduct you can

190
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
check your program or online

191
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,880
uh so obviously covet's been on our

192
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,479
minds um so uh you know as you've seen

193
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,720
we are requiring vaccinations and masks

194
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,120
we just asked that like hey i know masks

195
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,440
are really annoying believe me i i get

196
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,680
it but we do ask that you wear them at

197
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,599
all times unless you are actively eating

198
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,520
or drinking or you're actually

199
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
presenting um and then again this is

200
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,319
inside inside does include the tint just

201
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,360
to be uh specific on that

202
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,240
so outside hopefully the weather is okay

203
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
but outside as long as you're on the

204
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,599
patio outside the tent you can take your

205
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,120
mask off

206
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,880
again if you start to feel sick at any

207
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,360
point please just go home you know

208
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,599
we we record all the talks they will be

209
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,400
on youtube in a couple of weeks so

210
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,560
you're not going to miss anything there

211
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
so again if you start to feel sick sick

212
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,000
go home

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,160
we have tons of hand sanitizations all

214
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,560
around the venue please avail yourself

215
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,479
but most importantly wash your hands

216
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,840
with soap please thank you

217
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,280
there's

218
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,240
so we have a video and photo policy this

219
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,520
is unique to

220
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,800
you know our conference and a couple

221
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,479
other conferences as well

222
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,840
and the policy is pretty simple it's

223
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
just that you need permission of all the

224
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
people in the

225
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,759
frame that you're taking um before you

226
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,479
take any kind of photo or video or any

227
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,440
kind of other media form

228
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
so uh if for some reason you actually

229
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,919
you mistakenly take one or something and

230
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,919
somebody asks you to remove themselves

231
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,400
just please do that um we want to make

232
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,800
sure that we are respecting everybody's

233
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,479
personal preferences

234
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,240
so thank you for that we do have one

235
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
exception for this we have a official

236
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,360
photographer yep there she is um so she

237
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
is helping to capture the magic that is

238
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,240
b-sides

239
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,840
hopefully get some of these photos on

240
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,280
the website we've already been posting

241
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,520
some stuff on twitter as well

242
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,039
but if for some reason you don't want to

243
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,400
if she if she's taking a photo and you

244
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,440
don't want to be in it just let her know

245
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,199
