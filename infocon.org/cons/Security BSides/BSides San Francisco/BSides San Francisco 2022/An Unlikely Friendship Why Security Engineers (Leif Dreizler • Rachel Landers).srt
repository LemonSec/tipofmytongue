today they will be telling us about an

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,920
unlikely friendship why security

19
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,680
engineers and product managers should be

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,399
working together

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,840
thank you thanks everyone

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,399
great uh thanks for the intro uh i'm

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,199
leaf this is rachel and we're here at

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,559
b-sides and we're stoked to be here and

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,320
we're stoked that all of you are here

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,920
and we're gonna tell you about uh some

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,320
of the stuff that we've been working on

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,680
so just a high level of what we're going

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,520
to cover today first we're going to talk

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
about some of the common pain points

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,680
felt by enterprise product managers and

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
security engineers then we're going to

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
talk about our unlikely friendship

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,479
between product and security we're going

36
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,000
to talk about a few of some of our

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,520
earlier projects that we worked on and

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,640
then we're going to actually walk you

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,080
through building

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
one of the enterprise security features

41
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,280
that we tackled together

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,720
then we'll wrap it up

43
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,799
and leave some time for questions

44
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,720
if there's anything in this uh that you

45
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
think you want to reference later i

46
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,320
uploaded the slides this morning to the

47
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,799
sketch link so if you just go to our uh

48
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,280
like b-sides page the pdf of the slides

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
is there so

50
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,520
yeah that's easy to find

51
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,759
i think context is important so a little

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,479
bit about segment we're a b2b software

53
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,320
company and we build a customer data

54
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,280
platform

55
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,000
this cdp is used by folks in marketing

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
product engineering to create a single

57
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,399
view of their customers which we call

58
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,520
end users

59
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,079
and we process over a trillion events

60
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,159
for months so this is a very data-heavy

61
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,280
company

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
we have a very modern tech stack which

63
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,200
is great primarily built using

64
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,799
typescript and go and it's all in the

65
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,679
cloud as of about a year and a half ago

66
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,319
we were acquired by twilio so if uh

67
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,760
seems like stuff you might want to work

68
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,680
on we're hiring for a bunch of different

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,120
things inside security outside security

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,400
you might be thinking what does a single

71
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,800
view of customers actually mean i think

72
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
in the security industry the single pane

73
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,640
of glass gets a lot of so

74
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,160
this is not quite that this is just

75
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
something custom that you build

76
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,080
you can create tracking events for

77
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,760
anything that you want and then you can

78
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
send that data through segment to things

79
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,519
like salesforce google analytics you

80
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,760
know whatever your your company uses

81
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,599
we'll send it there

82
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,040
it's worth noting that this is only

83
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,959
first party data so we don't share any

84
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,879
data between our customers

85
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,160
our customers have to build their

86
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,640
profile about the end users individually

87
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,959
now you have context on segment as a

88
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,720
business and a product and now we're

89
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,640
going to introduce ourselves and talk a

90
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,840
little bit about some of the the

91
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,200
problems that we were facing in our

92
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,840
roles at segment um so part one the woe

93
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,879
of the enterprise pm aka me

94
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,480
uh my name is rachel landers i'm

95
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,080
actually currently doing a product

96
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
strategy at a company called patch i've

97
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,400
been in the it's a climate tech company

98
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
that builds apis to fight climate change

99
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,519
i've been in the climate space for about

100
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,640
two months

101
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,599
and if you are contemplating joining the

102
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,200
climate tech space now is the time to do

103
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,040
it it's really cool it's really awesome

104
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,599
um couldn't recommend it more before

105
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,360
patch i was a product lead at segment

106
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,120
where i was focusing on everything betw

107
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,280
from ranging from pricing and packaging

108
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
self-service and enterprise cx which is

109
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,519
basically like the customer experience

110
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,680
of the largest and most complicated

111
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,799
customers i'm going to be mostly

112
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,640
focusing on that particular role as we

113
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,840
talk about

114
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,159
the project that leif and i worked at uh

115
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,440
before a segment i worked a company

116
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,040
called microstrategy which if you're

117
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,720
tuned into the cryptocurrency world you

118
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
might have heard of it michael saylor is

119
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,319
big in the the bitcoin game that all

120
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,760
kind of happened after i left but now

121
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,000
it's a funny logo to have on my resume

122
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,480
um this is my first besides i actually

123
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
texted leaf yesterday asking what i

124
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,000
should wear and if i wore a blazer would

125
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,040
i look like an arc uh so

126
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,519
i hope you appreciate my product manager

127
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,640
presence in my my blazer uh anyways

128
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,680
um so

129
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,759
i was an enterprise pm for the the bulk

130
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,600
of my time at segment and i kind of want

131
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,680
to talk through some of the the woes

132
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,040
that i experienced and i think it's

133
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,479
actually going to be a lot of things

134
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,080
that you've heard before if you build

135
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
software or work adjacent to people who

136
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,600
are building software for enterprise

137
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
customers

138
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,639
enterprise customers are notoriously

139
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,320
noisy and demanding they have really

140
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,759
really high bars really really high

141
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
expectations they also spend a lot of

142
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,520
money on software and so oftentimes you

143
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,040
have to meet those

144
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,840
demands they also have disparate table

145
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,759
stakes that they expect because they're

146
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,080
so large and complex and um we'll get

147
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
into a little bit but spoiler alert uh a

148
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,759
lot of those table stakes are actually

149
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,919
product security features um and last

150
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,000
but not least they're incredibly complex

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
you'll have more users in an enterprise

152
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,880
instance of a sas application than maybe

153
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,479
a startup because there's more people to

154
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
use it and so they'll often find edge

155
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
cases that other customers might not

156
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,719
find

157
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
and now the woes of the security

158
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,840
engineer

159
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,240
uh these will prob oh uh intro first i

160
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,720
guess uh yeah i'm leaf uh i'm the engine

161
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,400
manager for the securities features team

162
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
at segment twilio

163
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,320
i'm also a conference organizer for

164
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,479
locomocosec which is happening later

165
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,880
this month so if anyone wants to go to a

166
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,039
really fun and really great conference

167
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,560
in hawaii there are still tickets we're

168
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,400
also looking for sponsors

169
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,520
and before this i was a sales engineer

170
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
at bug crowd

171
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,360
before that i was a security consultant

172
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,440
at redspin uh

173
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,639
probably one of the few people that

174
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,080
knows what that company is right here

175
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
jason haddocks

176
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,080
and i've also been pretty involved in

177
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,720
the security community as a chapter

178
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,120
leader for the bay area owasp and a

179
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,560
conference organizer for the apps at

180
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
california conference

181
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
fun fact b-side san francisco is

182
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,039
actually the first conference i spoke at

183
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,919
in 2015 so and this is my first time

184
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,759
being back as a speaker so very happy to

185
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,080
be here

186
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
so the woes of the security engineer i

187
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,600
think these are ones that a lot of

188
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
people in this room have probably

189
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,720
experienced firsthand

190
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
the first one is like maybe you're

191
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,319
seeing features in other software that

192
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,800
you think your customers should have

193
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,479
you know maybe your company doesn't

194
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,400
offer sso or maybe you don't offer mfa

195
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
or maybe there's something else that you

196
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,360
think is relevant to your business that

197
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,960
they don't have

198
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,720
the next one is you feel like you're

199
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,880
disconnected from the customer and from

200
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,800
other teams at the company and maybe at

201
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,479
a worst case they actually don't want to

202
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,319
work with you not only disconnected it's

203
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,960
like intentionally disconnected because

204
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,800
they perceive you as somebody that's

205
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
going to slow them down or block them

206
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
from doing things

207
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,520
i really do think like that sentiment is

208
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,560
changing

209
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,479
i think netflix and github should get a

210
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,720
lot of credit for promoting the idea of

211
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
security being a business enabler which

212
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,400
we'll talk a little bit more

213
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,919
later

214
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,120
i think another thing that i hear a lot

215
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,560
of security teams struggling with is

216
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,400
creating meaningful metrics

217
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,240
and this is really important because

218
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,000
this is a way that you can speak to

219
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
other parts of your business in a way

220
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,639
that they're already used to

221
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,039
understanding i think it's easy to talk

222
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,960
to somebody else on a security team from

223
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,800
another company and be like hey i did x

224
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,080
y and z and they're like oh yeah that's

225
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,599
really valuable that makes a lot of

226
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,360
sense but to another part of your

227
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,039
business that has no idea what any of

228
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,840
that stuff is it's a lot harder for them

229
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,560
to see the value

230
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,440
security engineering should be a team

231
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,960
that the rest of the company wants to

232
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,800
work with this is going to make your

233
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,639
life easier as a security engineer it's

234
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,000
going to make it

235
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,520
a more secure experience for your

236
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,280
customers which is going to benefit your

237
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,240
company

238
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,599
and i think one way to do this is

239
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,360
learning more about the teams that

240
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
you're supposed to be working closely

241
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,879
with and this goes for anything it's

242
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,319
like if you're in grc maybe that's

243
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,680
working with legal if that's in if

244
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,199
you're in sales maybe that's working

245
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
with the marketing team uh the more you

246
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,039
know about the teams near you the easier

247
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,479
it's gonna be for you to collaborate on

248
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,400
things

249
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,919
and this is really important for

250
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,280
security and engineering to have a good

251
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
relationship because security should

252
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,400
just be a component of building good

253
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,840
software the same way that you're

254
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,919
thinking about reliability or being able

255
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,919
to scale efficiently

256
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,840
your software should be secure

257
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,319
so let's talk a little bit about how we

258
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,160
can actually bring security engineering

259
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,840
closer to the rest of the organization

260
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,280
in a way that empowers the business

261
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,120
i think security as a business enabler

262
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,479
is something that's been pretty popular

263
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,879
over the last like five-ish years and i

264
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,840
think it's something that a lot of

265
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
people kind of just you know think is a

266
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,159
good idea at this point um but similar

267
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,839
to shifting left a few years ago i think

268
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,599
there's still maybe some ambiguity about

269
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,760
like how you actually do this and i

270
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,679
think the most important thing is being

271
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,760
aligned with your company's goals and

272
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,480
helping other teams execute

273
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,000
on things with the appropriate level of

274
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,640
risk not every company needs to have the

275
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
same security posture and so it's about

276
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,240
figuring out what level of security

277
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,480
posture is acceptable for the you know

278
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,399
business that you're in your customers

279
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,240
et cetera and helping your teams move

280
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,399
quickly if your competitors are moving

281
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,399
faster than you because you know you're

282
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,080
blocking them from doing you're blocking

283
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
your team from doing things that's going

284
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,959
to hurt your business and if your

285
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,720
business isn't making money

286
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,000
you're not going to be making money

287
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
either because this business probably

288
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,720
won't exist anymore

289
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
i think the next thing is ideally you're

290
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,279
helping make things faster easier and

291
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,279
more secure that's not always possible

292
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,959
but i think netflix should get a ton of

293
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,959
credit for promoting the paved path idea

294
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,040
which is like let's build a road let's

295
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,200
make that road easy to use and let's

296
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,120
just sneak some security in there maybe

297
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,399
people don't even realize that that's

298
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,760
the best honestly it's like if people

299
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,440
don't even know they're being secure

300
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
that's perfect

301
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,279
um and then i think the rest is just use

302
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,000
every

303
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,640
opportunity you can to meet people and

304
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,240
educate them so that they can just do

305
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,480
security on their own because engineers

306
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,920
are going to have a much bigger impact

307
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,440
on the security

308
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,680
of your product than the security team

309
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,360
there are so many more engineers that

310
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
are doing stuff it's like if those

311
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,080
people are all

312
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,800
advocates of security you don't need to

313
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,519
worry nearly as much

314
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,440
and then this is a great oh it's like

315
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,519
totally cut off that's so weird

316
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,279
um well if you download the slides

317
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,959
there's a

318
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,600
oh there we go perfect thanks i was like

319
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,880
why do i see on my screen that's so

320
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,360
weird um here this is a great talk from

321
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,800
absolute california from a couple of

322
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,279
years ago um that i think is is really

323
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,839
inspirational

324
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,079
yes pause for photos

325
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,200
um

326
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,600
so let's recall the org chart briefly uh

327
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,200
this is you know where security

328
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
engineering is we're going to zoom in on

329
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,200
security a little bit obviously there's

330
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,279
many other parts of security other than

331
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,760
just seconds and grc but we'll get into

332
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,480
that in a second

333
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
unfortunately a lot of the parts of your

334
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,000
security program are something that

335
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,519
customers won't see

336
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,120
probably the majority of your security

337
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,480
program are things that your customer

338
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,560
won't see this is things like enterprise

339
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,040
security physical security app set cloud

340
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,320
sec a lot of these are just things that

341
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,920
your customers don't directly interact

342
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
with they benefit greatly from them but

343
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,040
they don't really like see how they work

344
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
unfortunately probably the most

345
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,120
important part of

346
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,240
what a customer thinks about your

347
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
security is public comps during a

348
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
security incident hopefully you don't

349
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,839
have any of those but i think that those

350
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,959
can really

351
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,360
like shape in either way

352
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,880
what people perceive your security

353
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,040
program is like under the hood

354
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,399
i think the next one is actually

355
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,079
security features and so this is things

356
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,320
like single sign-on role-based access

357
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,959
control security events auditing that

358
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,560
kind of thing

359
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,839
and i think this is actually a

360
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,120
reasonable metric because i find it very

361
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,480
hard to believe that a company would

362
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,560
invest a lot in security features when

363
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,399
they're under investing in security as a

364
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,279
whole

365
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,120
i think if you have a strong security

366
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,120
program this is just a component of that

367
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,560
and it's a reasonable reflection that's

368
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,320
like hey this company is probably doing

369
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,920
a pretty good job in all these areas

370
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,160
that i can't see

371
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,360
there's also security certifications and

372
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,519
security questionnaires

373
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,000
i put these slightly below the security

374
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,680
features just because there's so many

375
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,360
fewer people at your customers that

376
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,279
actually review these maybe that's just

377
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,880
people on their grc team and the third

378
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,399
party risk team

379
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,880
but most of the uh you know people using

380
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,399
your platform probably aren't actually

381
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,040
looking at these

382
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
all right so to recap

383
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
uh security is a big ass iceberg there's

384
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,200
a lot going on under the surface

385
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
that a lot of people can't see and is

386
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,760
often really siloed away from teams so

387
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
now it's time for us to maybe tell a

388
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,200
little story about how leaf and i came

389
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,680
together and broke that silo down such

390
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,079
that we could work together and build

391
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,720
together towards a common goal

392
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,800
so if you recall our woes when we were

393
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,639
reading them out loud they maybe seemed

394
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,160
kind of related as you were listening to

395
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,519
them but if you take a closer look

396
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,760
they're actually um pretty complementary

397
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,920
towards each other um there's a lot of

398
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,000
overlap so i said that enterprise

399
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
customers are really noisy and demanding

400
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
uh leif mentioned that he didn't really

401
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
the security team didn't really

402
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,959
understand what customers wanted or

403
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,320
needed so that's an opportunity to share

404
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
the the wealth of the demands of

405
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,360
customers and actually help

406
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,440
synthesize those requests to other teams

407
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,639
so that you can have a diversity of

408
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,079
opinion on how you can actually solve

409
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,639
them or start to tackle them um i also

410
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,399
mentioned that enterprise customers had

411
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,959
pretty disparate and sometimes weird to

412
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,399
me the product manager that doesn't know

413
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,079
anything about security table stakes

414
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,399
that's an opportunity to bring those

415
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,000
requests and those table stakes features

416
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,160
that you see in rfps from enterprise

417
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
customers to the security teams and

418
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,600
start talking about how you can actually

419
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,040
solve for them

420
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,480
and then last is

421
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,399
security mentioned that they wanted to

422
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,839
be able to move metrics a little bit

423
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,440
more meaningfully that's the product

424
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,880
manager's job so if you can start

425
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
building features together then it's a

426
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,800
way to get everybody bought into the the

427
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,160
business metrics and so everybody can

428
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,440
start moving the needle a little bit

429
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,600
more

430
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,040
uh we wanted to take a picture of us

431
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
shaking hands but due to covid we

432
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,880
couldn't really get together so we asked

433
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,839
an artist to to animate something for us

434
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,680
um i think it's pretty lifelike

435
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,639
um but before we kind of talk about the

436
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,360
the big project that we we put together

437
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,959
together and built this presentation

438
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,720
around there's a couple low-hanging

439
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,800
fruit projects that the security team

440
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
actually tackled um sometimes with

441
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
product help sometimes without but we

442
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,000
really just wanted to demonstrate that

443
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
there is low-hanging fruit all around no

444
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,680
matter what company you work at i mean

445
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,360
you just have to like look around and

446
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,959
start to pick it um and leaf's going to

447
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,920
walk us through some of those features

448
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
cool yeah so the first one that we

449
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,320
worked on was a password strength meter

450
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,920
this was a great place to get started

451
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,839
because it was mostly front end changes

452
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,920
uh it was something that was easy for

453
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,600
customers to understand

454
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,920
it has a simple like four panel ranking

455
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,440
system we give them feedback if their

456
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,519
passwords been part of a an unrelated

457
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,880
breach

458
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,639
and really this was pretty easy to do

459
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,279
because we were able to use the dropbox

460
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,160
zxcvbn password strength library as well

461
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,480
as troy hunt's have i been pwned api

462
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,079
that allows you to meet the nist

463
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,639
password guidelines and everything other

464
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,959
than that is just like using

465
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,839
your company's front-end framework uh in

466
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,959
the case of segment it's something

467
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,480
called evergreen which is open source

468
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,880
and it's really easy to use and really

469
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,959
great documentation even

470
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,800
a bad front end engineer like me was

471
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,240
able to get something working pretty

472
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,639
easily

473
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,160
the next project which was slightly

474
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,279
bigger was

475
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,880
bringing multi-factor authentication to

476
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,240
our customers

477
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
this was an early attempt at a security

478
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
and engineering partnership and we

479
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,320
actually learned a lot about

480
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,639
how to make this more successful in the

481
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,920
future

482
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,680
the project was very successful in the

483
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,440
sense that it shipped on time there

484
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,920
haven't been any major problems with it

485
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,120
you know a lot of the code is still the

486
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,360
same as it was when we when we built it

487
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,040
um but i think we learned a lot about

488
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,519
kind of the the partnership process and

489
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,600
i was in no way excluded from the team

490
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,440
that uh we were working with but it

491
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,079
really was more like a relay race where

492
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,759
i built the back end and then somebody

493
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,360
else kind of just took it from there and

494
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
and did the rest of it in the future we

495
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,279
made a much more intentional effort to

496
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,680
actually make the person joining another

497
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,880
team feel part of that team and so uh

498
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,639
we would have one-on-ones with their

499
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,399
managers we'd attend the like weekly

500
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,959
team meetings uh we'd even attend like

501
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,120
fun social events i got invited to a

502
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,199
go-kart thing and actually won first

503
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,560
place and haven't been invited to

504
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,320
another one since but

505
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
uh

506
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,199
yeah it does work

507
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,199
um if you want to hear a little bit more

508
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,560
about some of this stuff

509
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,480
these are some things that i've blogged

510
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,560
and spoken about in the past the youtube

511
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,880
link is to a presentation from last con

512
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,360
last year

513
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,440
all right it's time to talk about the

514
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,959
the big security feature that we talked

515
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,399
to that we built together that we've

516
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,480
been talking about uh for the past 20

517
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,759
minutes

518
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,440
um like i said earlier i've said it a

519
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
couple times enterprise customers are

520
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,959
pretty needy and complex especially in

521
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,759
the way that they manage users in sas

522
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,639
applications um at segment and i'll talk

523
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,160
about a little bit what this looked like

524
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,920
but some of our largest customers had

525
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,600
over a thousand users that they were

526
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,079
managing like disparate

527
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,920
role-based access control across

528
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,079
manually in the ui it wasn't scalable it

529
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
wasn't sustainable and it

530
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,679
created a bunch of security gaps and

531
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,760
holes that we didn't love our customers

532
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,599
didn't love and we needed to fix

533
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,520
i saw this as a problem that i had no

534
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,000
idea how to fix but buzz lightyear aka

535
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
leaf came in and introduced me to

536
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,919
something called scim which is what we

537
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,199
ultimately built together spoiler alert

538
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,520
so as i mentioned managing users in the

539
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,080
segment app was really confusing you had

540
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,400
two options the first was to as i said

541
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,520
go in the the segment app ui and toggle

542
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,919
on or off different uh

543
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,840
roles for different users and there were

544
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,640
like

545
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,320
hundreds if not thousands of

546
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,919
permutations of roles that any

547
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,919
individual user could have and segment

548
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,320
as leif mentioned was processing user

549
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,559
data so there was also a pii component

550
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,880
to who had access to what and so it was

551
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,400
ultra important that our customers could

552
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,559
get this right and provide the principle

553
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,559
of least privilege with our application

554
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,080
the second option was like kind of a

555
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,880
non-option we had an api that allowed uh

556
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,559
customers to build tooling to manage

557
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,679
users but the api was kind of janky and

558
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,039
not didn't really work very well it's no

559
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,400
longer janky we fixed it we built a

560
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,840
completely new api but it was this

561
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,360
option that we provided for customers

562
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
that was programmatic and scalable but

563
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,120
actually didn't work very well and so it

564
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,960
just forced everybody back into that ui

565
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,720
which is almost worse than only having

566
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,320
the ui in the first place

567
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,480
but again we fixed it

568
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,160
hindsight 2020

569
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,880
always learn from your mistakes

570
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,960
so we've said skim a bunch of times and

571
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,799
you might be asking what is skim

572
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,039
uh it is the system for cross domain

573
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,520
identity management which i am the first

574
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,200
person i've ever heard actually say the

575
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,919
full name of everyone just calls it skim

576
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,840
but skim is amazing because it allows

577
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,760
your identity provider like octa or

578
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,240
azure active directory or whatever

579
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,120
to

580
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
create users put those users in a group

581
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,880
you know maybe move them to another

582
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,760
group

583
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,120
and then at some point when they leave

584
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,480
the company or they switch roles or

585
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
whatever you can de-provision them

586
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,880
this is amazing for customers that use

587
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,720
identity providers because these

588
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,160
customers are typically managing

589
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,120
hundreds of sas apps each one is its own

590
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,679
provisioning nightmare

591
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,000
and segment enterprise customers have as

592
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,080
rach mentioned hundreds or thousands of

593
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
users so multiply like you know

594
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,160
thousands of users by hundreds or maybe

595
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
even thousands of apps and that this is

596
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,720
a very very tough problem

597
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,559
this is a great tool because it's both

598
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,799
secure and easier for enterprise

599
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,640
customers to manage where people go

600
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,480
within your app

601
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,720
skim is really cool if you're a if you

602
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
work at a b2b app that doesn't offer

603
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,039
skim you should definitely look into it

604
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,520
um it would make the job of

605
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,600
enterprise security and i t people so

606
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,160
much easier if everything supported skim

607
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,840
it would still be a very tough job but

608
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
just like not dealing with like

609
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,360
did this person get removed from this

610
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,520
thing when they quit two weeks ago

611
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,480
that is a huge problem

612
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,000
so i'm the product manager at the

613
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,280
security conference and i'm about to

614
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,160
talk about process

615
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,320
most product management teams have a

616
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,919
product development life cycle and it's

617
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,120
basically like

618
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,200
the the

619
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,559
flow of the river like it's the way that

620
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,400
we have to go it's it's there's nothing

621
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,240
else if it doesn't follow the pltc then

622
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
it's not going to happen and so i think

623
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,919
something that leif and i have learned

624
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,640
and reflected on as we were building

625
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
this presentation talking about um how

626
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,400
we came to work together is it's really

627
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,000
important to meet somebody that's in a

628
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,840
different part of the organization where

629
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,520
they're at and so if you're working with

630
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,799
a product manager if you want to work

631
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,480
with a product manager to get a security

632
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,559
feature prioritized in a product roadmap

633
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,640
it's really important to understand what

634
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,360
the

635
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,679
the process is for a product team or a

636
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,360
product organization at the company that

637
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
you work at so i'm just going to do a

638
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,919
quick overview of the pdlc

639
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,440
throughout the presentation but the

640
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,480
first step of any sort of prioritization

641
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,799
framework or process is actually need

642
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,960
finding or identifying a business use

643
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,559
case and so there's a couple different

644
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,080
aspects to this that are important to

645
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,159
note um we need to build something that

646
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,320
is meaningful for customers meaningful

647
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,159
for customers right now like why is

648
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,799
right now the time to build something

649
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,240
and how is it going to achieve some

650
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
broader goal that we as a team or an

651
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,919
organization want to achieve

652
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,520
and as you're building a business case

653
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,720
you are often product managers or even

654
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,159
anybody in any org that wants to get

655
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,520
something prioritized will write some

656
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,200
sort of product requirements document or

657
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,960
prt this is kind of the grounding

658
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,120
document that everybody could can rally

659
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,440
around to understand what we want to

660
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
build why we want to build it and why is

661
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,720
it important right now

662
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
and it also becomes this artifact that

663
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,320
is passed through the rest of the

664
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,000
process all the way through to the build

665
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,240
phase where engineers designers

666
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,120
leadership marketing sales can all go

667
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,559
back to this document and understand

668
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,280
exactly like what we're doing and why

669
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,039
and so in this presentation we're going

670
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,480
to use the prd framework to talk about

671
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,360
why

672
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
and what we build for the skim solution

673
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,679
at segment

674
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,840
i think i mentioned this before but

675
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,559
why something is the right time to build

676
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,919
at that time is one of the most

677
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,080
important facets of prioritizing a

678
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,120
feature

679
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,960
so just to talk through why it was the

680
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,039
right time to build skim for us at the

681
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,480
time that we built it

682
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
we were basically just jumping on a

683
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,679
moving train um

684
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,840
we were rebuilding our apis as i

685
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,280
mentioned the old apis were a little

686
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,039
janky we needed to fix it

687
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,400
and so since we were already rebuilding

688
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,559
the apis we identified that as an

689
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,200
opportunity to build skim on top of the

690
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,760
unreleased api endpoints for user

691
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,039
management

692
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,400
and get something out the door to

693
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,679
customers before we were ready to

694
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,240
release the entirely new api and so it

695
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,520
was just kind of a right time right

696
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,799
place and it's really important to kind

697
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,520
of

698
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,799
look around look at what trains are

699
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,480
moving and and hop on the moving train

700
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,520
that's going in the direction that you

701
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,840
want to go

702
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,520
so the first section of a prd that i

703
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,880
write and i think most product managers

704
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,559
write is the vision and with the vision

705
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,240
you're really trying to paint a picture

706
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,760
of the world that you want to build with

707
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,919
whatever feature that you're building um

708
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,400
what's the tldr also since this is at

709
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,840
the beginning of the document this is

710
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
going to be the section that all of the

711
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,120
leadership team reads and nothing else

712
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,039
and so this is the time to really nail

713
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,880
in what you want to build why it's

714
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,320
important so that you can get there by

715
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,400
and not waste too much time

716
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,919
so in the case of skim the vision that

717
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,520
we wanted to paint was that customers

718
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,720
could leverage

719
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,799
their identity provider for a seamless

720
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,000
and scalable solution for

721
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,480
programmatically managing users and the

722
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,559
the end goal for the user here was to

723
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,320
reduce friction and managing users and

724
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,200
so that

725
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,000
there was no friction point such that no

726
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,919
additional users could be added to an

727
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,360
enterprise application because we were

728
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,799
actually finding and i'll get into the

729
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,720
problem statements a little bit later

730
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,480
but we were finding that it was so

731
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,559
difficult to manage users for these

732
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,000
enterprise it teams that they just

733
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,919
weren't letting people onboard onto our

734
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,520
product which completely stunted any

735
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,120
sort of growth

736
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,679
or expansion of the the product use case

737
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,039
which is

738
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,559
not good i feel like i don't have to

739
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,039
tell you all that

740
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,440
this next section that you really want

741
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,919
to focus on is painting the problems um

742
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,279
why does this particular part of the

743
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,840
process suck what is the experience like

744
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,360
for the customer and just really nail

745
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,679
down the different issues that exist

746
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,960
that you want to software so that you

747
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,799
can have the full scope of the problem

748
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,720
identified so when it's time to actually

749
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,480
spec out the solution you have full

750
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,760
coverage of all the problems that you

751
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,679
wanted to solve versus like a 50

752
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,600
coverage or something like that

753
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,559
um so at segment the user and group

754
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,840
management was really challenging at

755
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,640
scale the the companies weren't granted

756
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
access to the right things there's a

757
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
little screenshot at the bottom

758
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,480
we provided just in time provisioning

759
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,799
for users that had single sign-on or for

760
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,400
organizations that had single sign-on

761
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,880
enabled um but when they were

762
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,480
provisioned they had access to nothing

763
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,240
so we had users onboarding to our

764
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,159
platform and then just dumped into this

765
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,760
abyss if you don't have access to

766
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,720
anything

767
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
because there was no scalable way to

768
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,600
grant them access to something when they

769
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,840
were provisioned and so it was not only

770
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,520
a security issue if people wanted to

771
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,360
just like give access to everybody for

772
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,679
everything it also was a user experience

773
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,200
issue because they didn't have access to

774
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,720
anything and so they would come into a

775
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
tool with a particular goal and they had

776
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,559
no idea how to to solve for it because

777
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,240
they would just hit a brick wall a

778
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,480
proverbial brick wall

779
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,720
um and then last but not least segment

780
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,360
is a customer of segment and so we were

781
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,760
actually uh everybody at the company was

782
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
originally provisioned into the segment

783
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,039
workspace so that we could use it for

784
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,039
our own uh product releases but it

785
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,120
became so hard to manage that everybody

786
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,799
got kicked out and so then only like a

787
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,799
select few had access to the segment

788
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,640
platform and we had to go through them

789
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,960
to to get events tracked for for our

790
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,799
product releases and so we ourselves

791
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,799
were definitely feeling this pain and

792
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,480
could empathize with the customers that

793
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,200
we're feeling it too

794
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,760
so you probably bought in to skim

795
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,279
already because rachel's done a great

796
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,760
job of selling it um but the goal of

797
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,679
this isn't to convince you to build skim

798
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,679
this is really to show you some insight

799
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,000
into the process uh so that you can

800
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,240
maybe replicate this where you work and

801
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,000
part of it should be like why is the

802
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,400
technology that you're backing the right

803
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,480
one and maybe at the point of the prd

804
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,240
you're undecided that's totally fine you

805
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,520
might have a couple different options

806
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,880
where you're like maybe we should go

807
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,400
with this vendor maybe we should build

808
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,720
this thing ourselves you know maybe we

809
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,720
should build this other thing and that's

810
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,159
totally fine if you're outlining the

811
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,320
pros and cons that's great

812
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,159
but for us skim was the obvious choice

813
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,760
because this is already something that's

814
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,080
leveraged by it teams at enterprise

815
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,840
companies there's a standard that

816
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,080
defines it there's multiple rfcs that

817
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,919
tell you what you need to build

818
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,480
how you need to build it and as rachel

819
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,000
mentioned earlier we were already in the

820
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,600
process of building our user and group

821
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,159
management api and so we had the

822
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,919
underlying functionality we just needed

823
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,039
to

824
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,720
translate it in a way that skim could

825
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,200
understand

826
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,200
so

827
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,039
as mentioned earlier

828
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,120
we actually benefit a ton from skim

829
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
ourselves we have this internal tool

830
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,440
called access service um somebody on my

831
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,760
team andy lee wrote a blog about it um

832
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,159
you can read a ton about access service

833
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,919
but basically what access service does

834
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,000
is it's an internal app you go to access

835
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,520
service you say hey i need access to

836
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,679
this thing somebody who is an approver

837
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,200
for that thing gives you access for a

838
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,360
set period of time

839
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,080
this works with octa apps and groups

840
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,679
and octa groups are really amazing

841
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,159
because you can map a group in octa to a

842
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,960
group using skim into a service provider

843
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,120
like segment and so you go to access

844
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,360
service you get approved the api puts

845
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,039
you into a group in octa and then octa

846
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,559
puts you into the corresponding group

847
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,039
within segment and so now you have the

848
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,520
exact uh you know group access that you

849
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,000
need to do your job

850
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,399
okay so we decided to build skim we

851
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,799
pitched it we got buy-in but now we need

852
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,320
to actually narrow down

853
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,799
what specifically we need to build so we

854
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,960
got the y and the when

855
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,200
good to go but what was a little bit

856
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,840
unsure so we looked into the data um and

857
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,679
just a note to anybody who doesn't know

858
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,320
are that stands for annual uh

859
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,159
i don't actually know what it stands for

860
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,840
annual recurring revenue

861
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,480
oh man saturday sorry all

862
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,640
right and i'm recurring revenue um and

863
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,880
so we actually used two different like

864
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,200
slices of data to understand which

865
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,559
particular um idp to build for so the

866
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,240
number of customers is important just to

867
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
see kind of like the scale of usage

868
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,360
across an idp but also the our share was

869
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,600
really important to us because uh those

870
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,880
were the customers that we wanted to

871
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,799
keep happy because it's recurring

872
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,640
revenue and so if we keep them happy

873
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,480
then perhaps the recurring revenue will

874
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,720
stay the same or even increase

875
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,520
you may see the also the emojis mean the

876
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,120
juice was worth the squeeze i thought it

877
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,320
was kind of cute but it's probably a

878
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,000
little bit convoluted so just wanted to

879
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,679
call that out but you may be wondering

880
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,559
why we decided to go with the azure

881
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,320
active directory which is the third line

882
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,840
here but if it's only representing two

883
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,200
percent of ar and 12 customers this is a

884
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,640
really important lesson that i learned

885
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,919
at this time and also have kind of

886
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,600
continued on with other projects i've

887
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,000
worked on is the importance of marrying

888
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,320
qualitative data and quantitative data

889
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,640
so the quantitative data the first two

890
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,279
home run need to build them this third

891
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,039
one though we actually had a couple

892
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,399
customers that were using active

893
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,000
directory that demanded skim like they

894
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,600
needed it or they were going to walk

895
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,440
they they used it for all of the other

896
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,520
sas apps that they were using segment

897
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,840
was the only exception and they needed

898
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,760
it and so in working with our customer

899
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,360
success team that was

900
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,960
on the ground with the customers hearing

901
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,720
them understanding what they actually

902
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,399
needed we were able to understand that

903
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,240
we could actually save that two percent

904
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,080
of error which two percent is a low

905
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,760
number but that's still a fair amount of

906
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,919
money um and also try to get a little

907
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,440
bit more buy-in from other customers

908
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
that could be using it as well so always

909
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
really important to marry the

910
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,640
quantitative and the qualitative data

911
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,180
together

912
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,360
[Music]

913
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,279
another aspect of the prd just to kind

914
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,159
of walk through the the product manager

915
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,240
process is to build user stories which

916
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,840
user stories i think are really

917
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,919
important and helpful and are used by

918
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,600
many product managers because it helps

919
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,480
us to build empathy towards the end user

920
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,960
by putting yourself in their shoes in

921
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,360
the statements that you make about what

922
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,880
they need what they want and some of the

923
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,720
problems that they're facing so as an

924
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,880
example for scim

925
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,440
as an i.t manager i want to connect my

926
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,279
company's idp to segment so that i can

927
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,200
automatically provision users based on

928
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,760
their team and trust i think trust is a

929
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,200
really really important aspect of

930
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,039
building any sort of security feature

931
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,799
and trust that the right folks have

932
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,720
access to the right data and nothing

933
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,960
more

934
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,679
so now we're going to move to the next

935
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,120
phase in the process which is writing

936
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,159
the sdd this is the software design dock

937
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,600
and this should be really heavily

938
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,679
inspired by your prd and you should

939
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,080
definitely steal a lot of content

940
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,440
the goal of this doc is really to

941
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,880
convince people that you're building

942
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,799
something in a sensible way and invite

943
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,320
them to make suggestions about how

944
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,720
things could be improved the std should

945
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,880
be very complementary to the prd in the

946
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,320
sense that the pr that all the

947
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,320
requirements listed in the prd are

948
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,000
things that should be

949
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,159
part of the proposed scope for the sdd

950
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,000
a great place to start with your sdd is

951
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,159
just links to other documentation

952
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,840
whether that's something that's internal

953
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,440
or external

954
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,080
defining terms things like that

955
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,600
you really do want to meet people where

956
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,000
they're at currently when you're writing

957
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
the std you've probably thought about

958
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,600
this problem more than almost anybody

959
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,159
else at your company and you need to

960
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,559
make it so they're not lost when and

961
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,640
like looking up every other thing

962
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,960
linking to other internal docs is really

963
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
helpful too because people might be like

964
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,320
oh yeah i was actually part of that

965
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,000
project like now i understand how this

966
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,760
thing that you're building is connected

967
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,200
to this other thing that like i actually

968
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
already know a lot about those are great

969
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,039
people to invite to review your sdd

970
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,799
because they probably know stuff about

971
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,480
these systems that you don't know and

972
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,919
they're going to bring up really good

973
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,399
pieces of feedback

974
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,799
here's an example of some of that

975
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,760
feedback from our co-worker drew

976
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,440
i don't know if this you know is

977
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,960
something that like maybe that i knew at

978
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,559
the time but it's a great call out by

979
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,799
drew and you should definitely consider

980
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,679
feedback from your co-workers as a gift

981
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,880
the next section that you're going to

982
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,120
work on is the context and background

983
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,480
section

984
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,440
similar to rach's comment during the prd

985
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,880
like there's probably a lot of people

986
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,559
that are just going to read this context

987
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,440
and background section and that's it

988
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,200
and so you my

989
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,440
guidance for this section is write this

990
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,880
for a level of understanding that's

991
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,799
somewhere in between like your manager

992
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,559
and your manager's manager people that

993
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,320
are familiar with like what you're doing

994
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,240
on a day-to-day but not actually

995
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,440
involved

996
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,600
like too heavily in that process you

997
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,360
don't need to define every single thing

998
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,039
like just kind of assume that people

999
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,640
generally know like what is happening at

1000
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,919
your company

1001
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,240
but write it at a level of depth that

1002
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
you know they don't like have to be

1003
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
working on that thing

1004
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,640
and as part of this like never pass up

1005
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,240
an opportunity to do a little bit of

1006
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,640
selling uh always include a little bit

1007
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,000
of a pitch for like why this is

1008
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,519
important maybe you throw in some

1009
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,399
high-level customer stats

1010
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,159
people should generally be on board from

1011
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,640
the prd section but

1012
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,880
it doesn't hurt to convince people again

1013
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,039
that this is a good idea

1014
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,120
always be selling

1015
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,440
okay you may or may not be thinking why

1016
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,480
the hell are y'all writing so many

1017
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,679
documents like when are we going to

1018
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,279
actually build this thing i think it's

1019
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,640
really important to maybe delineate the

1020
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,000
the engineering

1021
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,559
technical process with the the product

1022
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,760
discovery

1023
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,399
business need finding etc process and i

1024
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,559
had a mentor one time that broke it down

1025
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,000
in a really clear and concise way which

1026
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,120
is how i broke it down here where

1027
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,440
product owns what are we building and

1028
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,200
why and then engineering owns uh

1029
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,120
how are we going to build it like what

1030
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,960
system should we use what technology

1031
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,880
should we use and when not necessarily

1032
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,240
when is the right time to build it but

1033
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,919
how long is it going to take and when

1034
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,679
can product managers go back to the

1035
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,360
customer facing teams and say this is

1036
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,440
when it's going to be ready and i think

1037
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,600
there's obviously a lot of different

1038
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,360
pieces and parts of handoff throughout

1039
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,200
the entire process but there's a very

1040
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,679
clear handoff point between the prd and

1041
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,880
the std that is important to share the

1042
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,720
sense of ownership of the feature and

1043
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,559
kind of pass that ownership over when

1044
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,080
it's time to start some of the technical

1045
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,799
implementation

1046
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,159
i actually love writing sdds because i

1047
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,639
love the phrase weeks of programming can

1048
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,800
save you days of planning or something

1049
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,280
along those lines and i find that

1050
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,960
if you actually write a lot of this

1051
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,639
stuff out you're going to come up with a

1052
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,079
plan that's a lot better and it's just

1053
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,599
going to save you time like nobody likes

1054
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,960
building something halfway and then

1055
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,560
realizing you

1056
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,079
totally botched

1057
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,480
the design

1058
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,000
so now that we've talked about

1059
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,839
determining business need you've written

1060
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,679
your prd you've written the sdd

1061
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,839
everyone's like super excited about

1062
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,000
whatever you're trying to build um let's

1063
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,440
actually talk about building skim a

1064
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,199
little bit

1065
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,879
so as a quick refresher at the end of

1066
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,280
the day skim is really just user and

1067
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,119
group crud

1068
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,960
it's provisioning users de-provisioning

1069
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,280
users creating groups you know deleting

1070
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,720
groups updating things like that

1071
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,560
and going back to our original business

1072
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
use case kind of from a more technical

1073
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,880
slant the goal was to create parity with

1074
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,520
the segment ui so on the far right we

1075
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,760
have our control plane service which is

1076
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,240
our modern monolith that powers much of

1077
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,119
segments web app and api

1078
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,040
the back end of segments app is the app

1079
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,440
gateway section and then on the far left

1080
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,040
you have segments web app

1081
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,720
what we are trying to do is create

1082
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
parity for identity providers to call

1083
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,359
the api endpoints to be able to do that

1084
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,960
same user and group provisioning that

1085
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,800
you could do with hundreds of clicks in

1086
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,520
the application

1087
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,560
so zooming in slightly

1088
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,160
as rachel mentioned earlier we are

1089
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,880
really just jumping on the moving train

1090
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,160
at the end of the day the user

1091
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,480
management endpoints that are called by

1092
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,119
both our public api and the skim

1093
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,040
endpoints are the same those are part of

1094
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,720
control plane service

1095
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,960
skim actually lives inside of our public

1096
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,079
api

1097
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,359
which has

1098
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,200
non-skim user management endpoints like

1099
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,280
if a customer wanted to do this

1100
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,800
you know using their own system for some

1101
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,040
reason they could they could write this

1102
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,200
but identity providers are calling the

1103
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,000
skim endpoints

1104
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,240
so this part's going to feel a little

1105
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,320
bit like drawing the owl because uh you

1106
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,680
know we're not going to actually fill in

1107
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,079
the whole owl um

1108
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,599
this is going to be very specific to

1109
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,680
your business like i can't build skim

1110
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,359
for you like i built it at segment

1111
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,880
because i knew what segment does but i

1112
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,359
don't know what your company does

1113
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,720
but i will give you a couple of tricks

1114
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,800
if you're like hey you know leaf

1115
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
skim's going to change my company's life

1116
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,400
i got to build this thing

1117
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,720
definitely start with the rfcs

1118
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,440
the rfcs are pretty dry but they are

1119
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,280
very helpful and they

1120
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,000
really define like what you need to do

1121
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,839
i'd highly recommend using a library for

1122
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,839
the query filtering

1123
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,320
skim supports a bunch of like queries

1124
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,560
that you don't want to parse yourself

1125
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
and then really for a minimum viable

1126
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,400
skim implementation you just need to

1127
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,599
support get delete post and patch for

1128
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,280
users and groups

1129
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,560
there's tons of other stuff that the

1130
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,400
skim spec supports it's actually very

1131
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,119
massive but in practice the identity

1132
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,400
providers don't really care about a lot

1133
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,240
of it

1134
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,000
and then some tricks

1135
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,400
really read the onboarding docs and

1136
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,680
understand

1137
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,440
the onboarding process for the different

1138
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,880
identity providers that you're planning

1139
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,000
to support

1140
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,079
here's a couple of my faves and how we

1141
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,599
avoided them first octa requires that

1142
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,920
you support marking a user as

1143
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,680
inactive

1144
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,200
segment doesn't actually have a concept

1145
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,800
of an inactive user you're either in a

1146
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,720
workspace or you're not in a workspace

1147
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,880
so that's what we do when octa wants to

1148
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
mark somebody as inactive we just kick

1149
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,920
them out of the workspace when they want

1150
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,760
to make them active again we just invite

1151
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,520
them back

1152
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,760
the next one is azure

1153
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,599
really wants you to be able to retr

1154
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,599
return a group without its members they

1155
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,160
just want to know the metadata sometimes

1156
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,680
and they won't let you onboard your app

1157
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,520
unless you support this filtering

1158
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,280
so we just put in an if statement that's

1159
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,720
like hey if you want to filter this one

1160
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,640
thing we don't return it we don't

1161
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,400
support any other filtering because none

1162
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,000
of the other identity providers cared

1163
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,320
about filtering anything and then the

1164
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,800
last one one login really wants to do a

1165
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,520
put during user provisioning to align

1166
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,680
the properties of the user within one

1167
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,400
login to your app

1168
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,720
we actually support very few group or

1169
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,400
user attributes it's just email and

1170
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,079
display name we don't let identity

1171
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,839
providers update those so we just

1172
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,079
respond to their put with a get and we

1173
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,079
just return the user

1174
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,560
so this is like you know pretty specific

1175
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,320
to skim but this is just to illustrate

1176
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,480
like it's worth it to read the identity

1177
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,800
provider docs so you can avoid some of

1178
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,320
these like weird little quirks

1179
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,680
we've talked a lot about identity

1180
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,920
providers if you build skim please take

1181
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,760
the time to build the integrations with

1182
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
the identity providers same thing goes

1183
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,320
with sso this is going to cut down on a

1184
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,079
ton of support requests it's going to

1185
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,839
make customers way more likely to use it

1186
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,079
because it's easy the worst thing you

1187
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,680
can do is build sso and then like

1188
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,520
require your customer success team to

1189
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,280
like do a bunch of stuff to like get

1190
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,359
somebody on board that is nobody likes

1191
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,839
doing that

1192
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,680
but if you've promised a customer that

1193
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,200
this is going to be done by a certain

1194
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,960
time make sure you build this into your

1195
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,800
timelines because the identity providers

1196
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,720
are not very fast

1197
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
i actually give octa a lot of props they

1198
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,480
were able to get our app onboarded in

1199
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
like three to four weeks which was

1200
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,599
pretty good considering some of that was

1201
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,000
like waiting for me to do things uh

1202
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,079
azure active directory was like three to

1203
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,920
four months and a decent amount of back

1204
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,960
and forth

1205
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,200
and unfortunately one login took almost

1206
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,160
a year

1207
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,760
to onboard so

1208
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,440
if you have a noisy customer that is a

1209
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,359
shared customer with one of those have

1210
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,720
them be annoying to the identity

1211
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,839
provider because i think you could

1212
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,599
probably jump the queue but

1213
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,720
yeah if you don't have that like

1214
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,839
definitely build in a lot of time

1215
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,680
so now you've built it everything's

1216
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,599
great your customers love it there were

1217
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,040
probably some things that went great

1218
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,480
during the process there are probably

1219
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,240
some things that you learned

1220
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,119
i think doing a retro at like a project

1221
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,720
level is really common in engineering

1222
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,920
land

1223
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,760
may be slightly less common in security

1224
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,359
land but i would highly recommend that

1225
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,319
you do this because it's a great way to

1226
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,560
reflect it's also a great way for other

1227
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,839
people on your team that weren't even

1228
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,599
involved in the project to learn a

1229
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,079
little bit about what you're up to and

1230
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,280
they can maybe avoid some of the

1231
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,160
mistakes that you made

1232
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,960
and in the spirit of reflection we would

1233
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,640
love to share some of the lessons that

1234
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
we learned and takeaways of working on

1235
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,079
this project working together

1236
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,480
collaborating etc

1237
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,319
so recall the woes

1238
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,200
um

1239
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,880
customers will always be noisy and

1240
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,560
demanding specifically enterprise

1241
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,319
customers but we talked about a number

1242
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,319
of ways to kind of leverage the power of

1243
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,680
the demands and build something really

1244
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,720
really cool

1245
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,839
um i think the all of these was actually

1246
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,079
really manifested as opportunities to

1247
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,480
work with leaf and the product security

1248
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,280
team

1249
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,960
but specifically around the table stakes

1250
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,800
which i wasn't really that big of a

1251
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,079
surprise in the way that it was probably

1252
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,920
framed at the beginning but

1253
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,400
some key takeaways enterprise software

1254
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
is secure software and they can't exist

1255
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,079
without one another like enterprise

1256
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,359
customers just aren't going to use your

1257
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,040
software if it's not secure and so if

1258
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,560
you're not building product security or

1259
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,160
weaving product security into your road

1260
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,319
map uh you're going to fall behind

1261
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,640
security is your friend not your foe i

1262
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,079
think there's probably like a meme in

1263
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,240
the product community of like security

1264
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,680
being kind of noisy with all of the

1265
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,359
vulnerabilities and all the extra stuff

1266
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,800
to do but like

1267
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,960
it's all going to make a better stronger

1268
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,640
more secure product which again if you

1269
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,839
want to have better price customers

1270
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,480
which pay the most money uh you want to

1271
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,640
have a secure product um rachel wasn't

1272
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,560
paid to say that i promise

1273
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,040
i'm here at my own free will

1274
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,359
um and also many of these enterprise

1275
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,200
problems these table stake problems have

1276
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,960
already been solved um so you don't need

1277
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,480
to boil the ocean and you should

1278
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,240
definitely work uh smarter and not

1279
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,920
harder and work with your security team

1280
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,960
because they probably know a thing or

1281
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,560
two about existing security features

1282
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,560
that you can build into your product

1283
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,319
and every pm knows this but i think it's

1284
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:52,240
really important to kind of drive home

1285
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,480
in every facet of an organization is

1286
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,839
that you should use the data that you

1287
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,520
have access to and that you should track

1288
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,839
metrics and build everything that you

1289
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:01,520
you are doing at work towards the

1290
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,440
metrics that you're trying to move

1291
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,280
and so just always grounding on a north

1292
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,000
star or a particular goal is paramount

1293
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,440
to a successful workplace

1294
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,599
and then tying things back to the woes

1295
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,760
of the security engineer i think one of

1296
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,680
the biggest benefits of building stuff

1297
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,240
collaboratively with engineering is you

1298
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,760
learn a ton about your company's

1299
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,000
architecture the people on my team all

1300
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,760
have a very good understanding of the

1301
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
like parts of segment that we interact

1302
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
with regularly and this makes it a lot

1303
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,480
easier for them to propose new designs

1304
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,680
for things if they want to build

1305
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,520
something like they actually know

1306
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,920
you know roughly how to do that

1307
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,520
it's also great for if you encounter

1308
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,280
vulnerability you can probably figure

1309
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,040
out like literally the specific line and

1310
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,359
like maybe even a recommended fix and

1311
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,640
when you can do that it's just way

1312
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,240
easier for engineering teams to actually

1313
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,960
like go in and fix stuff

1314
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,000
you're going to feel a lot more

1315
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,200
connected with these teams because

1316
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,720
you're literally like working directly

1317
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,720
with them and when these teams are

1318
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,920
customer facing that's going to bring

1319
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,520
you a step closer to your customers

1320
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,119
with metrics

1321
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,440
we learned a lot from working with

1322
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,240
rachel and our our product team and

1323
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,000
metrics are now every are part of

1324
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
everything that my team builds even our

1325
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,440
most simple services should have at

1326
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,599
least one product metric as well as

1327
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,520
health metrics this makes things like

1328
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,000
on-call lot easier because things break

1329
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,560
less often they break more predictably

1330
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,400
and it's easier to fix them

1331
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,760
and

1332
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,880
the

1333
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,400
presentation wouldn't be complete

1334
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,240
without talking about some metrics

1335
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,400
related to skim

1336
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,640
so roughly a third of our customers that

1337
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,880
use sso which i i consider to be a

1338
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,480
prerequisite to using skim use skim

1339
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,319
which is pretty cool because sso is

1340
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,000
actually built like three or four years

1341
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,680
earlier than skim and so there's

1342
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,359
probably a lot of customers that just

1343
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,680
like haven't really revisited their

1344
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,599
sso config and so

1345
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,520
the fact that a lot of them are using it

1346
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,960
is pretty cool

1347
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,119
it's also associated with just over

1348
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,200
one-fifth of segments arr which is

1349
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,119
pretty cool for something that was only

1350
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,240
built a couple of years ago

1351
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,680
and uh part of

1352
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,440
uh you know doing this work in

1353
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,280
collaboration with another team is you

1354
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,359
should be able to do this independently

1355
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,520
uh moving forward just like we expect

1356
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,680
engineers to be able to do security

1357
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,800
tasks autonomously we can do a lot of

1358
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,160
this stuff that we were previously

1359
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,480
reliant on other parts of our business

1360
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,640
part of shifting left is about learning

1361
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,640
from engineering product and design

1362
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,720
so the most important part of

1363
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,480
building this in is actually just making

1364
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,599
time for it part of our sdd or our prd

1365
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,599
is actually defining the metrics that we

1366
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,920
want to collect and maybe you'll decide

1367
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,119
later that some of those are too

1368
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,960
difficult or you know you won't be able

1369
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,400
to do them but like it at least gets you

1370
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,560
thinking about what you should be doing

1371
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,720
and it's also part of our work breakdown

1372
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,480
structure if you don't make time for

1373
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,240
this at the end of the project you're

1374
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,760
inevitably going to get pulled to like

1375
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,160
whatever is next and you shouldn't

1376
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,480
consider the project done until you have

1377
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,720
at least done part of this

1378
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,400
this makes it a lot easier to quantify

1379
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,400
the success this goes back to one of the

1380
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,240
things i said way earlier in the

1381
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,160
presentation about being able to define

1382
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,680
things in a way that other parts of the

1383
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,280
business can understand

1384
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,280
and it's easy you know for a security

1385
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,040
person to say hey you know i built this

1386
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,680
thing um but a sales person they're like

1387
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,960
i don't know what skim is but when you

1388
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,280
tell them like hey this is used by 21 of

1389
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,520
our ar they're like oh that's cool

1390
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,520
um it's also a great thing to put in

1391
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,200
people's performance reviews if somebody

1392
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,640
on your team works on something that's

1393
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,800
really awesome being able to tie that

1394
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,359
directly to um you know metrics is

1395
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,119
really helpful to like get them promoted

1396
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,319
or get them a better score during

1397
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,400
performance time

1398
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,160
it also makes it a lot easier to plan

1399
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,160
future work because people

1400
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,359
are bought into your previous work

1401
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,040
they're like oh that team is good they

1402
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,040
built cool stuff they have metrics like

1403
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,640
we trust them to keep making good

1404
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,920
decisions

1405
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,599
which makes it easier to get future

1406
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,960
projects funded especially if it's

1407
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,240
something maintenance related because

1408
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,079
you can say hey this thing's slow or

1409
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,599
this thing's expensive or this thing is

1410
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,319
used by a lot of people

1411
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,160
so i want to do one final example that's

1412
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,720
not related to skim just to prove that

1413
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,319
we're able to do this stuff on our own

1414
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,400
without the help of rachel

1415
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,480
this is actually a project that our

1416
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,480
intern did last summer

1417
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,800
the goal was to create a new part of our

1418
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
web app that encouraged workspace owners

1419
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,960
to turn on mfa at the workspace level

1420
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,560
this is really important because once

1421
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,560
it's turned on at the workspace level

1422
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,040
everybody in the workspace has to use it

1423
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,880
this is a great summer intern project

1424
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,280
because it's a combination of greenfield

1425
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,079
development as well as

1426
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,720
you know based on existing work and they

1427
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,000
were able to create a nice little

1428
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,920
dashboard uh to show off as part of

1429
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,040
their summer intern demos

1430
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,960
so you'll see here when the workspace

1431
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,920
dashboard or the nudge was introduced uh

1432
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,079
it was just under 10 of active

1433
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,760
workspaces we're using mfa

1434
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,160
we turned the modal on and

1435
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,800
by default and we saw a huge spike in

1436
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,640
the number of workspaces that were using

1437
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,480
mfa which is great

1438
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,560
you'll notice that the number

1439
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,920
goes down which i'll talk about on the

1440
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,119
next slide

1441
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,040
but that kind of this shows the

1442
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,319
importance of defaults which any product

1443
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,240
person can tell you defaults matter a

1444
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,520
ton

1445
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,280
and you might be think asking like why

1446
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,920
did we turn the default from on to off

1447
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,680
when it was so successful

1448
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,680
well we realized it was actually

1449
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,240
annoying users because they would click

1450
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,000
continue they weren't paying attention

1451
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,200
they were just like get me into the

1452
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,599
workspace and then they had to turn on

1453
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,000
mfa themselves which they didn't want to

1454
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,160
do but they had to to get into their

1455
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,640
workspace to turn off mfa and then turn

1456
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,960
it off for their account and so we made

1457
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,200
this change to only turn on mfa for the

1458
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,160
workspace as a default on this modal if

1459
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,319
the user already had mfa turned on for

1460
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,920
themselves because if they have it on

1461
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,280
for themselves then they can still get

1462
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,119
right into the workspace

1463
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,160
which you know isn't annoying for them

1464
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,359
so

1465
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,200
if you want to hear more about what

1466
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,880
twilio's up to

1467
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,480
my manager eric is speaking at 1 30 and

1468
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,480
jeevan who's in the audience right here

1469
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,040
is at 3 30 so they have some really

1470
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,040
great uh talks that you should

1471
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,040
definitely attend and

1472
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,079
that is it for us we are on twitter if

1473
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,599
you think we'd be cool people to work

1474
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,640
with we have uh job postings

1475
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,800
and again the slides are part of the

1476
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,400
b-side schedule so if there's anything

1477
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,160
you want to revisit later

1478
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,480
it is all up there

1479
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,640
thank you

1480
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,000
i think it's lunchtime so if you guys

1481
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,839
have any questions we're here but if

1482
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,240
you're hungry then go get some food

1483
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,558
thank you
