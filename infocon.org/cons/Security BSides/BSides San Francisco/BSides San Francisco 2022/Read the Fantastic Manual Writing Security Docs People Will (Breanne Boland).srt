land and infrastructure

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,360
before that for a bunch of years i was a

35
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,799
professional editor which is why i have

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,240
many opinions about many things you're

37
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,560
about to learn about and you're also

38
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
going to see my ux background poke out

39
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,920
here and there it informs a lot of this

40
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,200
stuff

41
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,119
i'm also doing a signing of a book i

42
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,720
contributed to called reinventing cyber

43
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,960
security at 3 pm up at the b-sides table

44
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,479

45
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,560
excellent colleague carla so we have

meeting lots of different kinds of

50
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,159
learning styles where they are there is

51
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,159
a blog post version of this talk

uh so what are we gonna talk about for

59
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,320
the next

60
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,119
23 or so minutes um

61
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,640
we are going to talk about figuring out

62
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,560
what kind of documents to write how to

63
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,759
write it where to put it once you've

64
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,840
written it how to socialize it how to

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,799
evaluate it and then what to do next

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,360
and give you a little context for

67
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,800
the kind of documentation i'm talking

68
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
about here i'd say it applies for small

69
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
companies up to companies of maybe 5 000

70
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,440
people basically just shy of where a

71
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
company can pay for

72
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,440
a comms team and a content strategist

73
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,800
and the stuff i'm going to talk about is

74
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,280
it's important there but it's less often

75
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,800
that engineers are pressed into writing

76
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,400
documents there so it comes up a little

77
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
bit less

78
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,440
but let's dive in

79
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,800
first we need to figure out what we need

80
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,120
to write

81
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,959
and for that we need to spy on our

82
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,720
colleagues

83
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,160
we're going to start by eavesdropping if

84
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,440
it's safe for you to go back into an

85
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
office that's amazing i used to love

86
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,480
sitting in the middle of the office and

87
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
just figuring out what people didn't

88
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,239
know yet by listening to them talk

89
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,400
for us a little more right now uh it is

90
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,360
slack

91
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
ideally you have a channel that's

92
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,800
something like ask security that says

93
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,239
hey people with security questions why

94
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,000
don't you pop in and people are you know

95
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
operators are standing by waiting to

96
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
answer your questions and the great

97
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
thing about this is it also gives you a

98
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,000
place to collect those questions so you

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
know what's going on

100
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,319
we also need to check views on existing

101
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,760
docs

102
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,440
confluence and google drive both do this

103
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,800
in different ways

104
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
a warning this can be gutting especially

105
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,640
if you're the person who wrote some of

106
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,239
the existing documentation to look at

107
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,239
something that you remember spending two

108
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,280
weeks on and 17 people have looked at it

109
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,799
but the thing is we need to know or else

110
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,200
we're not going to do this right

111
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
we also need to talk to people who

112
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,799
depend on this work who will be honest

113
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,760
with us

114
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
ask them are the docs out there are they

115
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
written the right way are they covering

116
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
the right material where are the gaps

117
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,360
people can tell you where you need to

118
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,680
start

119
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,040
we also need to learn from the past and

120
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,239
incidentally this is what i think of

121
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,519
whenever i hear the phrase pick your

122
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,560
brain

123
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
i think it is very gross but i like this

124
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
picture a lot

125
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,879
so

126
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,239
learning from the past

127
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,760
if we can

128
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,920
talk to the person who's responsible for

129
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,519
all the existing docs before which might

130
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,560
be you

131
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,159
but if it's not you want to go and just

132
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,480
get a sense of what has transpired

133
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,640
and if that person's no longer there

134
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,080
try to figure out why that is because

135
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,680
that might also be very instructional

136
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,959
we also want to figure out what docs

137
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,319
have people traditionally shared and

138
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,959
also just as important what docs have

139
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,720
people not shared what do people not

140
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,399
know exist and why do they not know it

141
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,320
exists when it's out there in a way that

142
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,639
someone thought it was accessible and

143
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,240
able to be found

144
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,479
basically we want to get a sense of the

145
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,759
efforts of old

146
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,080
and what's been done because uh

147
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,160
one thing that humans and engineers have

148
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,360
in common is if we don't learn from the

149
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,120
past we will repeat it to death and keep

150
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
screwing up

151
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,639
and while we're at the planning phase

152
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,240
remember to pace yourself this is not a

153
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,759
task where we're either trying to drink

154
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
the ocean nor boil it

155
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,280
and the great news is that when we start

156
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
putting some concentrated specific

157
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,479
effort into this people will notice a

158
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,240
little effort goes a long way

159
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,600
if you put some love into something that

160
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,759
has been a problem for a while

161
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,040
people will recognize it and be pretty

162
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
psyched

163
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,080
the other good news

164
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,160
we are not aiming for perfection

165
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
uh documentation is by its nature a

166
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,320
fairly subjective uh thing that we're

167
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,680
undertaking so there's no way to get 100

168
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,240
this is fantastic

169
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,759
the other thing i recommend just to not

170
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,600
burn yourself out

171
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
i like pursuing two questions at a time

172
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,600
this way you're not trying to answer

173
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,120
literally everything with every bit of

174
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,720
research you do

175
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,880
and also it lets you find interesting

176
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,800
connections between things

177
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
um

178
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
way more than if you were going very

179
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,199
single-mindedly and being like today is

180
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,479
only for this question and everything

181
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,359
else must be ignored

182
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,160
so to recap how do we know what to write

183
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,840
listen to conversations

184
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
read the chat ruthlessly exploit our

185
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,600
colleagues good natured communication

186
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
for our own devices

187
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
uh check stats on existing documents

188
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,639
just so you know what is actually being

189
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,400
used and how

190
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,919
ask around to see what's actually

191
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,360
working and what isn't

192
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,520
and as you go through stuff just work to

193
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,600
answer two questions at a time

194
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
once you answer one you replace it and

195
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,080
you keep on

196
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,160
so now that we have a sense of what to

197
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,520
write let's talk for a minute about what

198
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,960
it means for a document to be good

199
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,479
i promised you x

200
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,240
so it's a good document what enables

201
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,759
people to carry out the behavior that we

202
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,360
want from them

203
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,880
it's not uncommon for docs to be like

204
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,680
this

205
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,479
super cute very well intended definitely

206
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,919
the cats are going to work this way kind

207
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,840
of food dish design

208
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,280
where you think it's doing one thing but

209
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,880
actually something else comes out the

210
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,960
other end but it's okay we can get past

211
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
this

212
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
we can get past this by building a

213
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,400
better document

214
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,479
and one of my favorite ways to do this

215
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,880
is by including everything that you can

216
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,240
i've just read way too many tech

217
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
documents where just you know this

218
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
command or this detail gets left out

219
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,800
because there are assumptions made about

220
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,199
the reader that fundamentally don't work

221
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,800
so if you know something just put it in

222
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,720
there there's no reason to withhold its

223
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
commands it's file locations steps all

224
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,479
sorts of stuff just put it in there

225
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,599
because if someone's trying to figure

226
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,800
out what you're already trying to figure

227
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,319
out they need to know the same stuff

228
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,560
that you do

229
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,080
we also want the dock to be a complete

230
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,160
resource

231
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,520
imagine

232
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,840
there was an ill-fated off-site and

233
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,160
everyone succumbed to food poisoning

234
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,479
or kovid you know we're writing for the

235
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,080
survivor we want to get sigourney weaver

236
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
to safety and alien with our doc we want

237
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,440
to tell her everything she needs to get

238
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,479
this done and make things okay

239
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,400
and related to that because it's not

240
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
rare for a security doc to be talking to

241
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,880
someone on a pretty rough day of work

242
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,039
docs need to be friendly by which i mean

243
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,440
not adversarial it is important that the

244
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,960
person reading the doc feels like the

245
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
doc author

246
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,319
is rooting for them we have to be the

247
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,960
people's cheerleaders

248
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,879
and to bolster that

249
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,720
docs should not use a vocabulary that's

250
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,960
different than the user we need to speak

251
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,479
the user's language and if we introduce

252
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,560
new things we need to explain them

253
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,319
either by expanding in a parenthetical

254
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,759
linking to something

255
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,199
we just need to get them to where we are

256
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,400
to that end

257
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,080
we need to be really targeted

258
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,840
so for every document i write i have

259
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,199
this at least in mind if not written

260
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,319
down

261
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,080
i am just writing this doc for this

262
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,400
audience to describe this information

263
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,639
for this purpose

264
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,160
so for example

265
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,599
i'm writing this doc for our front-end

266
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,360
engineers to describe our preferred form

267
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,080
libraries to avoid cross-site scripting

268
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,280
it tells you what's in there you get a

269
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
pretty good idea of how it's written and

270
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,319
you have an idea of maybe what is out of

271
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,039
bounds and not so relevant

272
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,759
or a little more ambitiously i'm writing

273
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,440
the stock for everyone

274
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,200
to describe common fishing techniques

275
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,719
for thwarting recent spear phishing

276
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,958
attacks that's a different vocabulary a

277
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,360
little hard for right

278
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,599
or i'm writing this doc for that

279
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,719
executive

280
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,159
and if you've had that executive i think

281
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,760
you're picturing them right now

282
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,880
you know

283
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,800
to describe why we need this tool for

284
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
upcoming budget planning

285
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,320
so who are you talking to

286
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,160
what are you trying to accomplish it's

287
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
great to write this at the top of the

288
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,560
draft when you get started just so that

289
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,199
you don't drift

290
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
then you write it and you ask that

291
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,839
person that you decided to aim for if

292
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,120
this actually enables them to do what

293
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
they need and if not it's time to

294
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,839
iterate

295
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,040
so to sum up how do we know a good

296
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
document when we see it it includes

297
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
everything a person might need to know

298
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,519
about the subject or process to get

299
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,040
their job done

300
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,480
it's friendly speaks the user's language

301
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,080
and it has an intended audience

302
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
information to be conveyed and a stated

303
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,519
purpose for existing and this is how we

304
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,640
know if we've hit our mark or not

305
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,320
so we know what to write we know who

306
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,760
we're writing to

307
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,640
how should we write it

308
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
for that i have the perpetual security

309
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,480
answer i'm afraid

310
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,480
it depends it always always depends

311
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,440
there's so many possible kinds of docs

312
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,560
your purpose will determine what you

313
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,040
need to write

314
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,519
so for example docs to solidify process

315
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,720
you know playbooks you had a thing

316
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,959
happen here's what to do maybe you got

317
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,959
pii in the logs common stuff here's what

318
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,560
you do here you list out steps here's

319
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,920
who you talk to here's what you need to

320
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
change here's what to do to make sure

321
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,519
this doesn't happen in the future

322
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,880
with these especially expect to refine

323
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,560
it a few things a few times especially

324
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,519
if you're writing for people who aren't

325
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,560
familiar with this stuff but are

326
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,120
suddenly immersed in it

327
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
process docs describing what a team does

328
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,560
describing something that people need to

329
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,640
do from start to finish

330
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,480
and these can be either rarely used but

331
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
really still important or frequently

332
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,760
used and you'll get a lot of information

333
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,079
about it from people

334
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,920
and this kind of dock includes process

335
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,519
flow charts which

336
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,440
i will confess i have a bias i kind of

337
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,640
hate them

338
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,160
because they often seem like the first

339
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
last and only resort of attempting to

340
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,839
convey information from teams that don't

341
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,959
actually want to help you and mostly

342
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,200
they kind of wish you'd go away

343
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,800
so if it's the first thing a team throws

344
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
at people i get kind of leery

345
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,600
they i just don't find them as

346
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,040
accessible as people think especially if

347
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,480
it's a rat's nest of overlapping swim

348
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,399
lands

349
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,160
kind of like this nightmare this is what

350
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,519
i found on google when i

351
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,680
searched terrible flowchart

352
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,800
so

353
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,640
just imagine you have a task in front of

354
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
you and a team just said oh yeah just

355
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600
check out our flowchart you'll be fine

356
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,279
and then they hand you this

357
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,720
they hate you and this is what we're

358
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,399
trying to avoid

359
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,600
and if you must use one of these and

360
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,959
there are legitimate reasons sometimes

361
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,519
visual things are very useful

362
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,680
ask someone off your team who will

363
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
depend on this flow chart

364
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,120
if it works before you release it

365
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
because otherwise they're going to be

366
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,720
big opaque parts that will read as very

367
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,160
adversarial and that is what we don't

368
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,640
want to happen

369
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,839
okay

370
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,600
this is the word you slide i usually

371
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
avoid this

372
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,440
but it's this nice grab bag of how to

373
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,800
write tips so i just wanted to bundle it

374
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
together for easy pictures if one is

375
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,760
inclined

376
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,800
so

377
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
keep it friendly like we discussed

378
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,959
aim for informal language it's best just

379
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,040
because a lot of people i don't know if

380
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,800
you know this have bumped into really

381
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
unfriendly security people

382
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,640
and sometimes our job is to work to undo

383
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,120
that and this is one way

384
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,639
like we said explain all abbreviations

385
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,279
and acronyms on first use sometimes more

386
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,920
than once if the document's kind of long

387
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,279
and while you're doing it

388
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,360
link generously both internally to other

389
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,920
documents also externally we like to

390
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,760
reward the people who learn really deep

391
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,959
and you already looked at it so why not

392
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,399
just link it because you know which the

393
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,639
good resources

394
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,800
we want to make it clear who is behind a

395
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
dock this helps just so that it

396
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
deanonymizes things tells people who to

397
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,320
reach out to

398
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,279
if something's not going so well

399
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,560
we also want to chunk information with

400
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,440
headers because some people like to skim

401
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,800
some people command f their way through

402
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,880
life i do sometimes totally valid and we

403
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,079
want to support that there are lots of

404
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,279
different kinds of readers and lots of

405
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
situations

406
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,440
related to that we don't ever want to

407
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
assume someone's going to read the whole

408
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
doc

409
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,519
yeah i know we we make them lovingly we

410
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,120
pour all of our word smithery into it

411
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,959
sometimes or you know some of us nerds

412
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:43,760
do

413
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,959
but you can't assume that everyone's

414
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,399
going to take in your entire beautiful

415
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,040
efforts and that's all right

416
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,279
um and related to that a doc has to work

417
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,680
separately of any supporting material

418
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,880
sometimes it doesn't make sense to make

419
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,440
a beautiful interwoven

420
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,279
suite of documentation

421
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,440
to get people to a higher goal but most

422
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,399
likely they're just going to look at the

423
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,079
part of it they need to get their ticket

424
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,200
done that afternoon and that's the end

425
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,480
of it totally okay

426
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
if you're worried about attention spans

427
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,680
and it is something that people need to

428
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,279
read from start to finish

429
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,959
do not underestimate the power of animal

430
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,720
pictures and gifts

431
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
it gives people a pause it's a relief

432
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,079
sometimes in the middle of a bunch of

433
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,440
technical language

434
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
hello have you seen an axolotl lately

435
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,279
maybe your soul needs it that's

436
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,160
something that we can give

437
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,079
and finally include how to give feedback

438
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,160
in every document this can be comments a

439
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,639
link to chat a survey something like

440
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,480
that we just we want it to make we want

441
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
to feel like it's going two ways people

442
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,760
are not reading this in isolation they

443
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,199
can tell us if stuff's working or not

444
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,160
and it's really important

445
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,959
and worthy is slide

446
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
so how do we write a document

447
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,000
first you have to know what doc you're

448
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,279
writing based on the purpose you figured

449
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,240
out

450
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,839
remember that your job is to explain but

451
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,320
also to be approachable in words

452
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,079
act like each doc has to exist in

453
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,440
isolation because at least sometimes it

454
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,800
will have to

455
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,240
and make it skim friendly for people in

456
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,639
a hurry

457
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
so now we've written it

458
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,320
where do docs live

459
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,839
we are trying to avoid the digital

460
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,360
version of this

461
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,800
which i suspect most of us have seen

462
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,839
some version of

463
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,680
it has been my experience that there are

464
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,639
always

465
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,639
at least two doc repositories google

466
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,920
drive is often one just because so many

467
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,760
people use g suite it's just there and

468
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,560
people are accustomed to it

469
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,760
sometimes it makes sense to put things

470
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,320
in both places probably not though

471
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,839
so we just have to figure out which one

472
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,839
makes sense is the go-to resource for

473
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,360
people in need and then aim our stuff

474
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,040
there

475
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
we also keep chat in mind chat is not

476
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,279
documentation but it is a very live

477
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,040
information repository

478
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,399
so just keep in mind how things get

479
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,360
shared

480
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,639
it's sometimes going to be your job to

481
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,360
share it in there to get the job done

482
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,399
and we have to keep in mind that

483
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,720
governance works differently depending

484
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,639
on where you end up putting your docs

485
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,399
how do we indicate a draft versus a

486
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,399
final version for instance

487
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,680
it all depends on where you decide

488
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,920
things need to live

489
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,880
so we can learn the stuff through

490
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,959
observation and asking

491
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,800
or we can learn by trying something

492
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,639
getting it wrong and being corrected and

493
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,079
most likely this is going to happen but

494
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,920
that is great that is information and is

495
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,399
what we need

496
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,480
we also have to get a sense of a sense

497
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
of how people look for information like

498
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,040
are they reliant on docs uh that are

499
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,800
linked at the top of channels do they

500
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,720
usually go searching and this is

501
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,000
something you really need to figure out

502
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,440
at this point because it's going to play

503
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,959
into the next step

504
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,240
so are they searching in google drive

505
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,000
are they searching in confluence

506
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,759
do you know does the title of the doc

507
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,759
match the vocabulary

508
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,839
so going back to something i said

509
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,000
earlier the stellar thing i promise

510
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,040
you're not going to find a perfect

511
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,800
solution here and if you find yourself

512
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,880
ready to suggest the perfect document

513
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,399
repository that you used your previous

514
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,560
job if we can just buy it and bring it

515
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,600
in it's going to solve all of our

516
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,639
problems

517
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,000
uh stop don't do that um i want you to

518
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
remember the joke about now we have 24

519
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,320
javascript frameworks it applies here

520
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,360
too

521
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,040
throwing more places to put information

522
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,839
in

523
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,320
is not supporting our users

524
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,560
instead you're looking for like a 75

525
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
solution this is a very seize gets

526
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,560
degrees kind of situation

527
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,800
in our case the c is consistency just

528
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,000
whatever you do

529
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,680
just pick it and stay with it and it'll

530
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
be really tempting to like oh if only no

531
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
no just stay with it and then you want

532
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,800
to get actual information from the

533
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,880
people depending on it before you change

534
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,759
course

535
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,600
when you do communicate it and solicit

536
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,000
feedback

537
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,240
so yeah putting docs in the right place

538
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,440
we want to figure out all the places

539
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,800
docs can live

540
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,320
figure out how and where people tend to

541
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,279
search

542
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,959
figure out how they search

543
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,800
um match it when you can especially at

544
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,639
first and then stay the course until you

545
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,320
have reason to shift

546
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
so yeah now we're at the socialization

547
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,199
part let's get your work out there

548
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,120
which means you have to talk to people

549
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,320
i'm afraid

550
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,839
sometimes people end up in the putting

551
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,839
words in a doc work because they're not

552
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,440
thrilling you know thrilled to this but

553
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,320
sorry it's what we have to do

554
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,360
back to chat surveillance and

555
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,480
participation

556
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,160
this can be automated stuff it can also

557
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
be just kind of haunting everywhere

558
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,400
engineering team channels security

559
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,760
channels sometimes off-topic ones too

560
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,280
we're looking to see questions come out

561
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,559
even if they're not actually phrased as

562
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,839
a question we just want to be ready to

563
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,199
give the answer that's needed when the

564
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,679
question arises

565
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,760
then there are meetings which i know we

566
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,439
have lots of those and i'm telling you

567
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,720
to have some more

568
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,400
sorry

569
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,240
it's very effective though i like going

570
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,080
into team meetings and coming in with a

571
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,600
document that lets me answer questions

572
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
that have been asked before

573
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,200
it's very useful to be able to see when

574
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,720
people light up when you actually got

575
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,080
the details right in the thing you

576
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,480
decided to make

577
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,840
and even more efficient is if you can

578
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,600
get in those all hands

579
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,440
all engineering all companies stuff like

580
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,360
that if you just snag a few minutes

581
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,280
and you can promote what you did so that

582
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,360
everyone has that first knowledge and

583
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,799
first touch of what you've been putting

584
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,360
your time into

585
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,919
and if all that fails we're going to

586
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,520
bribe people

587
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,080
this is all cux it is okay to bribe

588
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,360
people toward the behavior you want

589
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,720
especially when it comes to security

590
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,960
because this is really important

591
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,880
one of my favorites because it is cheap

592
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,679
and delightful is stickers

593
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,120
and to that end

594
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,799
we're going to do an experiment

595
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,640
if you find me during the conference and

596
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,160
i'll be here all day tomorrow and tell

597
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,679
me one thing that you learned or liked

598
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,960
from this talk

599
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
i will give you a security 8 ball

600
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,559
sticker and i will not pass this out

601
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,600
outside of b-sides so this is for us

602
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,679
and for you when you go like hey i think

603
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,360
i see that pink and purple lady haired

604
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,280
lady and you come over

605
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,720
you too know that your behavior can be

606
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,679
swayed

607
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,400
so

608
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,799
i'll see you later

609
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,880
[Applause]

610
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,679
yeah

611
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,320
also good um badges people like flair

612
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,120
give them flair rewarding ambassadors by

613
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,960
talking them up is really good give

614
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,120
people public kudos have a way to give

615
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,559
public kudos that's a really good idea

616
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,919
to talk people up to their managers

617
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,840
stuff like that

618
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,760
coffee even though coffee is free in

619
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,600
offices and in the bay area is often

620
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,120
quite lovely actually

621
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,280
something about being enabled to go and

622
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,080
get a treat is really effective because

623
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,360
the thing is it's not about the monetary

624
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,960
value of this like giving bonuses is

625
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,559
above our pay grade we don't get to do

626
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,280
that

627
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
what it is is making a compliment and

628
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,679
appreciation more tangible and memorable

629
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,039
and this stuff is really good for that

630
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
because it's going to take some time and

631
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,480
i'll just read this to you

632
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,240
unfortunately the dry principle which is

633
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,600
don't repeat yourself often a good

634
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,880
principle in code

635
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,559
does not apply to humans

636
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,840
people need repetition as well as the

637
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,760
same content applied in different ways

638
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,200
people don't learn math from only an

639
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,120
explanation or only a textbook or only

640
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,400
examples

641
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,880
it's everything combined

642
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,400
and that's what we're working with here

643
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,880
you're gonna have to repeat yourself

644
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,799
and it's completely okay

645
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,080
people don't pick up on this stuff

646
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,320
sometimes at first exposure they need to

647
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,280
hear about it when they need it so it's

648
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,120
more like you mention the doc and then

649
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,480
it gets brought up in slack and then

650
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,919
someone says it in a meeting probably

651
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,160
you a link from a colleague

652
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,440
if you feel self-conscious about

653
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,200
repeating yourself which most

654
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,960
non-tedious people do

655
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,039
make a calendar and then you can just do

656
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,960
it on a schedule you know exactly how

657
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
much you've done it you can't imagine it

658
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,080
that it was way more

659
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,120
and then

660
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,720
you have a sense of what you're doing so

661
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,600
it's much easier to iterate

662
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
so getting work out there

663
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,400
promote where the people are chat

664
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,919
meetings all hands

665
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,360
get comfortable with repeating yourself

666
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,799
totally okay

667
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,320
and if nothing else bribe people into

668
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,039
the behavior that you want

669
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,000
so how do we know our efforts are

670
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,880
working

671
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,240
you know do they even like me do they

672
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,320
like our talks

673
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,600
the great thing is

674
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,960
because we are doing this we are all

675
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,080
winners it's great it's low stakes

676
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,360
we did the thing now we get to see what

677
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,799
to do next

678
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,240
so to evaluate

679
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,919
we need to ask people regular check-ins

680
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,080
one-on-ones do surveys you don't want to

681
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,280
overload on these some people have had

682
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,720
bad experiences

683
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,240
just make them regular short to the

684
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,600
point

685
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,120
check your metrics again

686
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,880
and finding a goal person is really good

687
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,320
and this can be a persona but also just

688
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,960
literally like emily on the next team

689
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,159
someone who has a bunch of needs that

690
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,600
are unmet in documentation who you can

691
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,200
check in with regularly

692
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,960
and say you know is this doing it or do

693
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,840
you need something else

694
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,080
we also need to review regularly a

695
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,679
quarter quarterly is good for it if that

696
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,440
makes some dread curl in your stomach it

697
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,799
can be biannually just as long as it

698
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,080
happens in a regular cadence and happens

699
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,360
and that's where that feedback comes in

700
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,720
if people are regularly able to give

701
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,159
like a thumbs up or thumbs down in a

702
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,320
document or add a little comment this

703
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,039
gets way easier

704
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,400
and a little note

705
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
there are cultures that don't have great

706
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,159
psychological safety and that can mean

707
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,520
that when you say hey tell me what you

708
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,440
think about this doc it can feel like a

709
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,320
trap

710
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,919
and that is unfortunate

711
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,000
uh changing that culture wide probably

712
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
also above our pay grade but we can make

713
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,919
a little bubble of psychological safety

714
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,000
by asking repeatedly

715
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,280
making it clear we want an opinion on

716
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,600
the document not our value as a security

717
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,000
engineer not my team's value just the

718
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
document and whether it meets the thing

719
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,360
it's trying to do

720
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,799
and if you keep doing that and you

721
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,480
people see that you take their feedback

722
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,159
and actually act on it

723
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,440
they will become gradually more

724
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,720
forthcoming

725
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,559
it's tough but we can't do this work

726
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,919
unless people actually tell us this

727
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,320
information

728
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,520
after that

729
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,679
ask around again determine your needs

730
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,600
and map your future

731
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
because we're trying to avoid this

732
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
this was at my bart station recently and

733
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
while i leveled maps and find this

734
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,960
adorable

735
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,880
if i were lost and saw this i would be

736
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,720
terribly upset

737
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,000
so we need to be on top of this stuff

738
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,600
it's measuring success

739
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
do your surveys talk to people get a

740
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,720
sense of what you're doing

741
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,559
review stuff regularly

742
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,080
create at the very least a beautiful

743
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,600
little bubble of psychological safety

744
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,840
around you and your documents

745
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,959
and then start the next cycle

746
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
so here's what to take with you as you

747
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,880
go back out into an actual physical

748
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,400
security conference that we're all at

749
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,080
meet people where they are friendly

750
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,120
language

751
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,400
explain anything that they might not

752
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,080
have bumped into before

753
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,240
um maybe this means sometimes meetings

754
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,600
instead of another confluent stock and

755
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,880
sometimes it can mean gifts instead of

756
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,080
code snippets depending on what your

757
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,159
goal is you have to be creative and try

758
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,799
to meet people with their weird needs

759
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,000
keep different readers and learners in

760
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,880
mind

761
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,520
we are a good beautiful varied group and

762
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,559
we want to talk to everyone

763
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,080
channels

764
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,600
we want to learn cultural norms what

765
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,720
they need so find channels about

766
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,000
communication just get a sense of how

767
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
people speak where they ask questions

768
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
what they need to know

769
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,559
see what people link and read

770
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,360
and then match and then iterate

771
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,600
and finally please do not burn out we

772
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,840
are at especially high risk of that

773
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,120
right now and i don't want that to

774
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,799
happen to any of us

775
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,880
so only answer two questions at a time

776
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,480
know who you're writing to

777
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,919
sometimes cultural norms are great

778
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,600
sometimes we need to change them figure

779
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,039
out which one is which

780
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,880
and recognize your limitations and know

781
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,120
that you can do wonderful amazing things

782
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,279
inside of them

783
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,080
thank you very much

784
00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:03,200
[Applause]

785
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,880
all right thank you brianne for that

786
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,200
talk um we had two questions on slido

787
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,840
but there might not be the time but um

788
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,039
i'll read out the questions and we could

789
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,520
answer it afterwards um sounds good

790
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,640
thoughts on using github as

791
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,320
documentation repository with plain

792
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,720
markdown formatting good strategy or too

793
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,640
limiting

794
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,240
it depends on who you're dealing with

795
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,919
there are some really beautiful ways

796
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,919
that markdown can be displayed and again

797
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,279
it's just consistency if people know to

798
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,039
look there even if they're not people

799
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,320
who will need to be able to like submit

800
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,720
a pr to update stuff yeah i've seen it

801
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,919
done really well there's no reason that

802
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,600
can't work especially if you understand

803
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,720
that different teams have different

804
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,679
comfort with that kind of thing

805
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,240
all right uh thank you brienne for

806
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,159
