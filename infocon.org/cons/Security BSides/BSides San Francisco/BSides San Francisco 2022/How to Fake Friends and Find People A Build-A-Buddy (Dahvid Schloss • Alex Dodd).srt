53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
themselves in these

55
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
situations so

56
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,720

68
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,800
countries that people start helping out

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
in aren't exactly friendly to americans

70
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,560
you know so

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
if they have the resources you don't

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
want to get your

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
your identity blown up by them

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
especially like from people from uh

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,599
the taliban yeah which we'll hit on in a

76
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,400
minute

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
yeah

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,239
so our agenda day

79
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,159
cool so we're going to talk about

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,040
what

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,000
how

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,120
you can maintain a little bit of

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,319
anonymity and safety when you're

84
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,000
performing these kind of operations uh

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
we're gonna talk about sock puppets what

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
are they why do you use them when to use

87
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,080
one

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,840
how to build it the process kind of from

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,920
start to finish on how to create a

90
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,799
believable and usable sock puppet so you

91
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,519
are not doing these operations your fake

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,840
gabe is performing these operations

93
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,799
keeps yourself a little bit more

94
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,799
anonymous

95
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,159
and then yeah differences consequences

96
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,840
and good and bad implementations we'll

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,400
hit those here towards the end

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,360
yeah so we're going to talk a little bit

99
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,640
about what our case study was about

100
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,200
first off right so this is the personal

101
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,640
experiences that we had in our

102
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,879
observations during the execution of

103
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,799
operation digital dunkirk you guys are

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,159
unfamiliar with digital dunkirk that was

105
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,480
an operation that happened last year

106
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,120
with the afghanistan pull out it's not

107
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,560
an officially

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
it's not an official government

109
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,959
operation right it's just something that

110
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,319
a bunch of vets got together and they're

111
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,040
like dude i worked with this guy for

112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,360
six months to a year and he's still not

113
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,280
out of country so um there was a pretty

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
large skill gap that was coming across

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,959
the board right there's people who have

116
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,880
never done cyber stuff in their life and

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,280
they're trying to help out in a huge

118
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,680
cyber operation to push paperwork

119
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
through to the us government they're

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
trying to help individuals get from

121
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,360
point a to point b you know get them out

122
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,040
of country um

123
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
isr the whole nine yards right

124
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,040
uh so there was a wide skill range um

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,720
and a lot of these people that that had

126
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,919
the lower end of the skill range were

127
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,520
actually just civilians of you know they

128
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,680
worked as a contractor and they they got

129
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,199
wind of it from a friend

130
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,160
so

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,479
a lot of like open cells very

132
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,520
unorganized but it was a huge movement

133
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
you know i would i would say close close

134
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,639
to a couple hundred thousand people were

135
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,680
operating inside this

136
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,800
go ahead

137
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
okay so like defeat said what was

138
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,840
operation digital dunkirk um obviously

139
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
named roughly after the evacuation of

140
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,960
dunkirk that i'm not going to do a

141
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,199
world war history lesson um the

142
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,639
collaborative distributed humanitarian

143
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
effort by veteran civilians we had

144
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,080
dental assistants i think at one point

145
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,680
like just random people that were trying

146
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,800
to help

147
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,160
and that's who we want to hit with this

148
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
talk is just people that are trying to

149
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,960
help you might not have a lot of the

150
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,000
experience

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
of how to hide yourself but you still

152
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
want to get involved

153
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,840
this is what we're going to do

154
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,000
lots of distributed cells little tiny

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
groups that got information from other

156
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
slightly larger groups we were working

157
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,039
in a group of about i don't know

158
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,240
eight

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,600
of

160
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,039
thousands of people that were actually

161
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,800
trying to get involved in this so lots

162
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
of little tiny groups all kind of doing

163
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,240
their

164
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,080
cell organizational structure trying to

165
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,280
get stuff done

166
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,960
um we were all trying to basically get

167
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
anybody that was in afghanistan that

168
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
could get out and wanted to get out

169
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,440
we're going to help you get out we're

170
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,400
going to help you

171
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,600
find and avoid checkpoints we're going

172
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
to process your paperwork for you we're

173
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
going to find you

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,039
we're going to find your routes we're

175
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,479
gonna try and get you out

176
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,160
um it includes all these people here

177
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,039
american citizens special interest visas

178
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,800
high profile afghan military targets all

179
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,560
these guys that are like i need out now

180
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,720
i don't have time cool we're gonna try

181
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,520
and help

182
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,440
yeah the basic result of this was close

183
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,800
to like 150 000 afghan nationals that

184
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
had helped the us government were able

185
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,639
to escape out of afghanistan that were

186
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,160
being persecuted by the taliban at this

187
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,800
time uh translators interpreters all of

188
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
our guys that are native there that we

189
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,440
needed to be there for the last 20 years

190
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,560
we told them we were going to get them

191
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,080
out and then we just kind of ripped out

192
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,400
i'm pressing buttons now

193
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
all right so uh the first thing we're

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,440
going to talk about today right is uh

195
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,400
what exactly are sock puppets right um

196
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,840
sock puppets as most of you guys know

197
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
are fake online personas that can help

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,599
you mask who you are when you're doing

199
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,759
things online um

200
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,280
normally associated with the baddies

201
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,759
right red teamers apts maybe

202
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,160
three-fourths of tinder uh also maybe

203
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
half of linkedin right

204
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
there's a lot of people out there that

205
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,199
use sock puppets to to hide their

206
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,960
identity but

207
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,560
on the upside

208
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,919
this can be used for good right

209
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,199
everything that we use for bad can be

210
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,840
used for good

211
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,560
so

212
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,000
why does it matter why does it matter

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,759
during humanitarian efforts

214
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,880
well

215
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,800
as i said the baddies have the internet

216
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,639
right the taliban has the internet

217
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,560
taliban actually controls all of

218
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,840
afghanistan's isp now

219
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,000
and you don't have to pay a whole lot to

220
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,800
get information from people or on people

221
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,199
right 99 cents off a pipl we'll give you

222
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,080
uh

223
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,240
the the last six known residents of an

224
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,759
american citizen

225
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,680
right um

226
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,759
it's stupid cheap stupid easy to find

227
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,639
people

228
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,120
uh also you may see a cowboy hat here

229
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,520
this is something that we had from soft

230
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
it basically means don't cowboy it up

231
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,639
right

232
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,039
don't go out and break the law for

233
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,400
unnecessary reasons if you're going to

234
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,039
break the law do it smart i would say

235
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,240
right especially if it's from another

236
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,560
country

237
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,120
all right so this is the part that i

238
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,720
have to read basically verbatim so these

239
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,160
fake personas use in conjunction with

240
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,479
good tactics techniques and procedures

241
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,160
can be the difference between activists

242
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,840
maintaining their ability to continue

243
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,280
operations

244
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,879
versus becoming a victim to harassment

245
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,639
or worse and we've seen harassment and

246
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,960
worse we'll talk about it later it's

247
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,800
because these ttps were not implemented

248
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,919
they were not used and these people

249
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,280
exposed themselves directly to

250
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
in our case directly to the taliban they

251
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,679
said hi i'm

252
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,799
rebecca

253
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,679
um

254
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,519
not a real name not a real name fake

255
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,958
name we're not we're not doxing anyone

256
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,320
here yeah but they expose themselves

257
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,679
directly to these guys and that cause

258
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,640
problems for them in their personal

259
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,480
lives later so

260
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,320
do it right and you'll be a heck of a

261
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,959
lot more safe

262
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,360
is this one me again yes yeah all right

263
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,160
so

264
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,399
where to start is the most important

265
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,000
thing and this one

266
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,160
kind of kicked me is are you ready for

267
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,320
this not am i technically incapably

268
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,680
ready for this are you ready to take on

269
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,000
the mental and emotional toll of what

270
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
you're about to do

271
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,240
in our operation this is not standard

272
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,320
hacker security conference stuff in our

273
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,240
operation we had people who lost lives

274
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
we had people who got captured by the

275
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
taliban are you ready to deal with that

276
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,399
fact

277
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,040
yeah i kind of wasn't yeah i did it

278
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
anyway and it was not good

279
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,640
it was it's rough to come back from so

280
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,920
first things first are you ready to deal

281
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,399
with what's about to happen

282
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
and then step zero is cash or card right

283
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,399
the age old question so we're going to

284
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,440
talk about going through these steps

285
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,720
we're going to acquire temporary phone

286
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
service we're gonna build your fake

287
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,240
persona that's my favorite part

288
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
uh and then we're gonna build an online

289
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
presence this works best if you do it

290
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,720
over a long period of time and you have

291
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,920
kind of some of these on the shelf

292
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
stacked up ready to use so it's not a

293
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,839
five day old profile obviously that kind

294
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,720
of raises some flags uh step four is

295
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,519
do

296
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,560
stuff

297
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,760
uh step five is not actually profit it's

298
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,000
go run you're up yeah and and i'd just

299
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
like to point out right so we're talking

300
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,959
about afghanistan at this current moment

301
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,640
but this is very relevant to a lot of

302
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,480
people who are operating in the ukraine

303
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,519
space right they you you guys may be

304
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,040
part of some discord channels out there

305
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,560
that are like oh yeah let's go hack

306
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,720
russia right like if you're gonna do it

307
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
do it smart right i'm not gonna tell you

308
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,839
don't do it

309
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,399
obviously

310
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,839
yeah also not telling you to do it um

311
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,760
right and that leads us specifically

312
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
into this how sophisticated is your

313
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,800
hostile entity a low-tech adversary is

314
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,320
gonna be a lot easier to mess with

315
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,160
online and help people get out of

316
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,360
country without repercussion to your

317
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,880
personal health

318
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,839
right

319
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,920
it's very unlikely that the farc which

320
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,040
is a south american terrorist

321
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,880
organization is going to come to the

322
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,519
united states and shoot you in your home

323
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,279
very unlikely right

324
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,399
is it

325
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,240
very unlikely that the taliban will come

326
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,560
here yeah i mean for for the most part i

327
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,480
would say yeah it's pretty unlikely

328
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,920
has it happened

329
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,680
has like al qaeda or the terrorists come

330
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,880
to the united states and kidnapped

331
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,440
people yeah it happened to a seal team a

332
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,800
couple years ago

333
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
you know the threat is real when they

334
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,839
have the money

335
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,720
so

336
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,399
you know you want to look at

337
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,040
these two aspects and figure out who am

338
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,440
i trying to screw with who am i trying

339
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
to help to get out of country and who's

340
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
persecuting these people

341
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
are they

342
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,600
easily to

343
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,360
are they easy to evade you know like a

344
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,959
logical threat that doesn't have like

345
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,320
very good

346
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,640
cyber space

347
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,920
detection or are are they going to be

348
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,680
very ingrained in the telecommunications

349
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,519
space right russia

350
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,200
you go you start hacking stuff in russia

351
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,160
they're going to know you're hacking

352
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,279
stuff in their country they're pretty

353
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,160
good at this iran's the same thing

354
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,480
right even the taliban now

355
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,240
before when they were taking over the

356
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,399
space they didn't have con uh they

357
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,320
didn't have control of the isps

358
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,160
now they have control of the isps they

359
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,800
have smart dudes you know they can they

360
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
pick up their ways they have cyber

361
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
criminals out there so think about it in

362
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,639
that case if you're looking at getting

363
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,560
into this kind of activity which you

364
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,639
know we all we would love for you guys

365
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,079
to come and help as much as you can

366
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,440
because there are plenty of persecuted

367
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,120
people out there

368
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,800
just be smart about it think about who

369
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,959
you're going after if it's gonna be a

370
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,600
very sophisticated threat actor

371
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,360
maybe take some time to build out your

372
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,519
sock puppet

373
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
and bear in mind can you kick back one

374
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,959
yeah

375
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,120
bear in mind this can change midway

376
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,200
through your operation right so for us

377
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,040
the taliban before taking over kabul and

378
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,880
the taliban following the takeover of

379
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,839
kabul

380
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,440
very different creatures

381
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
once that happened the game changed

382
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,720
because now they had control over the

383
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,000
isps they had control over all the

384
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
traffic and out of country so the way

385
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,720
it i guess be aware that it can change

386
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,839
on you once you've been noticed once the

387
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,360
geopolitical situation has changed in

388
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
taliban now owns kabul and all the isps

389
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,680
it changes so maintain some awareness of

390
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,440
what's going on and whether or not you

391
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,600
are currently dealing with not what you

392
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,760
started dealing with

393
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,000
yeah that was always that was a fun time

394
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,920
yeah it was it was weird right because

395
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,040
one minute

396
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,279
they didn't have kabul so you could take

397
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,600
your amsits out of country relatively

398
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,160
easy hey get on the phone be like hey i

399
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,600
need you to move to the airport right

400
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,480
now meet up with this contact go up and

401
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,399
fly out and then when they took over

402
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,560
kabul it was like i need you to take a

403
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,800
right on 7th street and then don't go

404
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
down mission right like something like

405
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,120
that it was very much you have to

406
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,800
navigate around and have so much open

407
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,120
source intelligence to know where you

408
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,320
need to get these people to avoid

409
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,560
so i think this is you or is this me oh

410
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,959
this is me okay so uh the age-old

411
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,320
question cash or card i think this is

412
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,839
the you know the common question left at

413
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,839
def con right now do they accept card

414
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,519
they do so it's kind of weird but um

415
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,120
there there are some pros and cons when

416
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,519
building out your your

417
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,720
uh

418
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,560
sock puppet wow i forgot the name of it

419
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,720
i'm talking about it uh so you know when

420
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,120
bill now your sock puppet to using cash

421
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,639
or some sort of uh really hard traceable

422
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,600
uh

423
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,839
material asset right so in this case the

424
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,440
pros is it's really cool when you have a

425
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,199
lot of cash right like everybody likes

426
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,519
to have that in their wallet uh

427
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,440
and you can spend things in singles but

428
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,320
it is nearly impossible to trace

429
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,079
the problem is is not everywhere is

430
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,680
going to allow you to buy like your cell

431
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,800
phone um or gift cards right visa gift

432
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,959
cards um

433
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,040
sometimes you have to use credit card to

434
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,240
purchase these things especially if you

435
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,320
go to somewhere like target there's no

436
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,240
point are you with the target employee

437
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,600
to buy something with cash because

438
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,800
you're trying to get away with some

439
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,040
illegal stuff later on right let's let's

440
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240

put up some cash in there i know you can

450
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,760
probably pull it off

451
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,680
um you know red team it a little bit be

452

454
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,120
go and do that but you know there is

455
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,880
there is advantages to using cash but

456
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,639
there is also disadvantages when going

457
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,880
out there

458
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,279
all right so

459
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,720
step one is actually going to be get

460
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,000
your temporary phone service this is

461
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,040
where

462
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
your build process is actually going to

463
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,279
start a lot of services require you to

464
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,880
have a cell phone number now has anybody

465

469
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
go get a fake phone get a track phone a

470
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,440

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240

473
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,639
get yourself a phone number um

474
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,720
physical phones are cool you can go to

475
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,320
walgreens cvs whatever buy a burner

476
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,639
phone we ended up using virtual devices

477
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,639
because i am a bum

478
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,040
and i didn't want to get out of my chair

479
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
so i'm not going to target

480
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,839
i use bluestack set up a uh android

481
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,279
virtual machine ran the phone inside

482
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,920
there burner app is an app that gives

483
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,240
you i think seven days of a free phone

484
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,880
number go nuts party on

485
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,480
is there a question

486
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,759
yeah that's gonna have to come off i

487
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,120
can't hear

488
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,440

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,130
i try not to recommend anything sir

490
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,320
[Laughter]

491
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,079
uh yeah so this is step one this is how

492
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,040
you're gonna get your phone number once

493
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,320
you have your phone number you can

494
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000
pretty much move on to step two which is

495
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
telling google this is my recovery

496
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
number give me my email address

497
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,480
yeah so um here comes the fun fake too

498
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,000
this is uh

499
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,800
uh

500
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,240
my favorite phrase when talking about

501
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,519
building out your

502
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,240
your persona online right is is don't be

503
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,320
a tin or catfish don't actually put

504
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
somebody else's

505
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,600
face out there right there are plenty of

506
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,839
tools that are really really cool you

507
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,399
know you get like you get the uh

508
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,320
the version of like iranian seth rogen

509
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,600
right here which i think is really

510
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,079
awesome right um

511
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,920
or even you know a little bit of zac

512
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,240
braff in the bottom right but

513
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,079
i mean ultimately these are all ai

514
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,600
generated these aren't real faces it's

515
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,720
not going to get somebody in trouble if

516
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,400
somebody does a reverse image search

517
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,919
which we've seen

518
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,000
adversaries do

519
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,240
and that's happened to one of our case

520
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,000
studies in here

521
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,119
you know we're not going to get anyone

522
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,959
else in trouble

523
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,799
you know so don't be don't be a tin or

524
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,359
catfish and then when you start building

525
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,839
out this fake persona really build out

526
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,959
their

527
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,319
their character who is this person

528
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,520
what's their first and last name where'd

529
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,679
they grow up what's their email

530
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,360
where they live what's their employment

531
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,440
because all these minor details might

532
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,400
seem really

533
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,880
minuscule and really like

534
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,280
unnecessary but depending on the level

535
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,559
of the adversary that you're going

536
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,600
against

537
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,120
they're going to look at that and if

538
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,559
they see this as immediately a fake

539
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,760
profile they're going to start digging

540
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,039
into that phone number and trying to

541
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,039
figure out exactly who and where you are

542
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,320
at

543
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,200
so um if you need help with that uh this

544
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,720
is the one thing i will recommend is

545
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,799
that fake name generator i use it for my

546
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,039
teams red teams all the time really

547
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,880
really good application will build out

548
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,320
everything right who their parents name

549
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,400
was uh you know

550
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,559
where uh where they live what they're

551
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,080
doing uh

552
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,360
even a credit card number which is

553
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,320
really weird because you're not gonna be

554
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,400
able to use it but you know there's

555
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,919
enough information in there to build the

556
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,160
persona

557
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,600
so let's do it

558
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,200
uh you'll recognize this gentleman from

559
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,559
the previous slide

560
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,960
he's again not real uh there's some some

561
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,320
artifacts in here that you can use to

562
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
kind of figure out that he's not real

563
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,200
his caller's all messed up on the right

564
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,960
side his ears don't match

565
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,799
uh he's a little goofy but once you

566
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,039
compress it and stuff it into a uh

567
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,880
what's the small picture yeah a little

568
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,240
facebook icon picture you're not gonna

569
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
see that stuff anyway um so this is

570
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,919
about the last time where we do

571
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,520
something that's gonna be fun during one

572
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,200
of these ops

573
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,160
[Music]

574
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,080
yeah and i just make fun of this guy the

575
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
fun thing is like you get to enjoy it

576
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,120
right like

577
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,840
if you gave this guy like a completely

578
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,160
stereotypical name i i you know he

579
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,360
definitely looks like the first name

580
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,640
would be john

581
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,919
right

582
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,440
uh he's a kent

583
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
or kent sorry if your name is kent um

584
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,000
you know but like you know you want to

585
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,240
have fun with it because ultimately when

586
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
you start joking around with the

587
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,160
individual that you're looking at it's

588
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,679
because you have some sort of bias of

589
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,520
what this individual looks like and

590
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,440
everyone is going to carry that similar

591
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,640
bias when they're looking at these

592
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,720
profiles it's kind of screwed up to say

593
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,600
but like we're only human right

594
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,440
this individual here i would say as an

595
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,960
occupation definitely looks like he was

596
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,640
in the military maybe like a second

597
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,840
lieutenant at one point in time and

598
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,679
dropped out a little bit afterwards he's

599
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,360
like i can't cut it i'm going back i'm

600
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,120
gonna go be a finance guy

601
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,080
you know

602
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,640
so you can start building out this stuff

603
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,240
definitely the username would look like

604
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,880
uh something sporty you know maybe out

605
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
of pittsburgh like steelers

606
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,000
steelers08 that's when he was born

607
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,200
you know have fun with it enjoy yourself

608
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,559
build out when you build these out

609
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,400
because you are going to build this out

610
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,039
months in advance if not years

611
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,720
so if you can build multiple

612
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
personalities

613
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,679
then

614
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,799
you know you're going to succeed in the

615
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,640
long run

616
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,000
and he's not real so it's really a

617
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,280
pretty victimless crime here

618
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,679
not necessarily so yeah so so make some

619
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,760
stuff up give yourself a backstory and

620
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,520
uh kind of fall into this role for a

621
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,159
minute because uh now we now we move on

622
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,240
to the next stuff which is substantially

623
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,679
less fun

624
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
is it i don't remember is

625
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,919
well the presentation's fun we're goons

626
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,600
but doing this stuff is substantially

627
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,799
less fun

628
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,880
yeah so this is actually the like

629
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,120
hardest part uh if any of you have ever

630
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
tried to set up a true

631
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,440
uh sock puppet in the last two years

632
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,679
you'll know that having a proper email

633
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,320
address and having a good phone number

634
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,720
is going to

635
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,300
be like the bane of all existence

636
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,600
[Music]

637
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,240
some services that provide burner phones

638
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,840
are actually banned

639
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
from gmail right they have like the

640
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,320
whole thing uh their whole phone list

641
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,760
where they're like you can't use this we

642
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
know this is a burner app go

643
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,520
go find something else right so it is a

644
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,919
pain the last time we used burner app it

645
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,840
did work i don't know if that's the case

646
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,679
anymore might not be the case after

647
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,679
today if one of you guys works uh

648
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,520
somewhere at like google so don't ruin

649
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,159
it for all of us leave us alone yeah so

650
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,520
uh the first thing you want is obviously

651
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,120
a privacy based email that's everything

652
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,559
that you're going to

653
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,360
like communicate over right when we were

654
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,080
working with the afghanis um we were

655
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,799
getting passport numbers similar to

656
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,640
their social security numbers everything

657
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,679
that we needed to fill out those

658
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,360
paperwork and we're getting it over to

659
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,520
the proper authorities right to our to

660
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,880
our military buddies that were on the

661
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,960
ground pulling people in right because

662
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,720
they have to identify the individual

663
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
with their name their picture their id

664
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,320
numbers everything so in these efforts

665
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,400
that's typically what you have to get

666
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,240
you have to confirm that the person is

667
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,159
who they are saying they are because we

668
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,480
all know how cheap a fake id is

669
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,200
hopefully it's about 250 for a u.s

670
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,919
american passport if you don't allegedly

671
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,039
allegedly yeah um part two it's getting

672
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,559
something like a common email right this

673
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,520
is where you're gonna sign up with your

674
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,400
facebooks your your linkedins your

675
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,880
whatsapp whatever it may be

676
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,840
um

677
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,679
and then yeah part three that's that's

678
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,919
when you're gonna build all of the uh

679
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,520
the profiles out to communicate because

680
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,600
you always want to have a primary a

681
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,280
secondary and a tertiary communication

682
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,400
when you're running any sort of

683
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,640
humanitarian op

684
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,559
uh

685
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,159
yeah yeah and like we mentioned earlier

686
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,440
it's best to have these kind of on deck

687
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,960
built out

688
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,159
several of them

689
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,159
so they're old they're two years old

690
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,760
they're not four minutes old trying to

691
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,440
start communications with somebody they

692
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
look a little bit more real

693
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,480
and then throw them away when you're

694
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,440
done and make another fresh new one so

695
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,720
age him a little bit fine wine fine wine

696
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,240
all right

697
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,760
so

698
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,880
if you were engaging with a

699
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
sophisticated enough organization which

700
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,080
we talked about earlier right taliban

701
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,520
post kabul

702
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,559
russia

703
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,799
uh

704
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,600
whatever sophisticated organizations

705
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,000
you're going to want to hide who you are

706
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,600
and where you are

707
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,000
so kind of goes without saying use a vpn

708
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,679
use a series of vpns tunnels and tunnels

709
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,240
and tunnels hide yourself

710
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,919
change your origination point

711
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,720
and

712
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,960
my favorite part is if it's a government

713
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,200
use exit vpn nodes that are in countries

714
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,799
that are unlikely to participate in

715
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,559
investigation for instance

716
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,559
literally anywhere in europe

717
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,080
if you're operating in russia again i

718
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
don't recommend that you do that they're

719
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
not going to cooperate if russia says

720
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,280
hey i need these vpn logs europe's going

721
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,840
to go no

722
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,679
um

723
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,440
china and india don't like each other

724
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,000
particularly india and pakistan north

725
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
korea south korea whatever just find a

726
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,120
place that's not going to cooperate with

727
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,480
wherever your operation is because

728
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,360
they're not going to cooperate and

729
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,679
they're not going to help get you burned

730
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,600
um if you find an accident note out of

731
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,840
north korea for a vpn tell us about it

732
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,799
because it would be pretty cool

733
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,360
[Laughter]

734
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,559
yeah so uh you know what now uh you've

735
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,120
had this you've had this uh sock puppet

736
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,919
for for a few months maybe a year or so

737
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,000
what do you do now well

738
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,360
you do the

739
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,400
we'll we'll do a live you go live right

740
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,159
uh things to do when you are working in

741
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,919
a humanitarian effort and this is very

742
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,080
very important and i can't stress enough

743
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,919
i'll grab the mic with two hands

744
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,320
validate who you're talking to

745
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,559
right this is something that we actually

746
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,360
saw

747
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,039
not being adhered to

748
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,360
with more of the untrained individuals

749
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,120
that were helping us out in the in the

750
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,159
larger group right only use uh temporary

751
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,840
devices for communication once you're

752
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,919
done you don't want it anymore trust me

753
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,000
the taliban will call you

754
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
they've done it that russia will call

755
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,960
you they've done it you know iran china

756
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,679
any other place that that has

757
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,000
sort of a uh a background of being kind

758
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,600
of malicious out there and not really

759
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
caring they'll definitely call you on it

760
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,720
they'll figure it out so throw the

761
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,880
device away right

762
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,320
um yeah i put it up there twice because

763
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,240
i can't stress that one enough too and

764
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,559
then when i mentioned this before but

765
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,240
always create a communication plan in

766
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,000
the military we call it pace right

767
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,400
primary uh alternative contingency and

768
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
emergency

769
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,720
it's a good idea just in case you lose

770
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,480
contact with an individual we had one

771
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
individual that we did lose contact over

772
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
a phone because the taliban took her

773
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
phone and smashed it

774
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,120
and how do we get a hold of her facebook

775
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,840
weirdly enough right so there are other

776
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,279
opportunities to communicate with

777
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,200
individuals and you just have to think

778
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,720
what do they have access to create a

779
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,080
paste pan plate uh pace plan

780
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,320
for everything uh and everybody

781
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,760
and then the last thing is create a

782
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,919
dress word this was really important in

783
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,400
afghanistan for when people

784
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,679
thought they were being followed by

785
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,679
taliban because then we could

786
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,840
move our individuals that were in

787
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,960
country

788
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,000
to be

789
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,400
kind of like a buffer zone right so some

790
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,720
sort of duress word that we can go okay

791
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,240
scrap everything we're going to an

792
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,919
emergency communication we know we're

793
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,760
probably going to lose the primary

794
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,520
um

795
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,240
things to not do

796
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,159
i don't remember that i wrote this thing

797
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,919
oh

798
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,720
yeah don't be in active communication

799
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,480
when the person's on the move this was

800
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,159
kind of a weird one this is something

801
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,080
something that we learned post-military

802
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,720
right uh this is because if they're

803
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,559
talking in english in a ca in a country

804
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,320
that speaks arabic

805
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,159
somebody's gonna notice and if somebody

806
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,919
notices that they're gonna take that

807
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,400
phone and then now you've just burned

808
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,880
that primary communication method so

809
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,240
don't talk while they're moving just

810
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,760
send them the instructions and be like

811
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,640
please please follow these instructions

812
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,520
and delete this message yeah uh second

813
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
thing don't group participants or

814
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,640
multiple

815
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,200
peop refugees in the same communication

816
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,559
channel right if one of those

817
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,320
individuals get burned they all get

818
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,279
burned

819
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,520
so you know their phones numbers are

820
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,279
inside that group channel too don't do

821
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,640
it just

822
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,360
don't be lazy copy and paste

823
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
don't promise anything this is more for

824
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,679
your mental health right if you say hey

825
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,640
i'm going to get you out of here it's

826
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,919
the same thing for docs right we're

827
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:08,799
going to do our best we're going to do

828
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,039
our best right and usually they're bot

829
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,679
their best is good it gets them but if

830
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,200
you start promising i'm going to get you

831
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,480
out of here alive and the next thing you

832
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,399
hear is somebody getting shot

833
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,360
it's going to screw you up a little bit

834
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,720
you know i i don't know how many of you

835
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,440
guys have spent time in the military but

836
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,600
it's not like the movies right even if

837
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,919
you're hearing it still screws you up

838
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,200
and then um

839
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,640
last thing you know don't

840
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,919
don't forget to do the things in the

841
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,799
things to do section

842
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,080
oh it's still me no no it's mine so

843
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
again your mental health is important

844
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,799
you cannot help if you

845
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,600
are unable to function right

846
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,799
i watched the talk earlier was it

847
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,799
yesterday about burnout yeah

848
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,320
it's going to happen real fast doing

849
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,760
this kind of stuff you're going to get

850
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,960
burned out

851
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,640
you're going to get hurt

852
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,480
sorry it's going to suck

853
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,360
um so take care of yourself right at the

854
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,480
end of the day

855
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,760
you're still a people

856
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
still be a people take care of yourself

857
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
uh know your limits don't take on more

858
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,960
stuff than you can handle we had people

859
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,440
do this uh actually we again talk about

860
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,760
this guy here in a little bit um

861
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,200
basically our

862
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,760
i don't want to call them leadership our

863
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,240
information channel goons we're saying

864
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,600
hey i've got 10 more numbers i got 50

865
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,799
more numbers i got five more people i

866
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,000
got 10 more people i need to find these

867
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,760
people and this guy i can't remember

868
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,600
what fake name we gave him later he was

869
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,279
taking them all he's like i got it i got

870
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,559
it i got it i got it i got it i'll take

871
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,760
him i'll take him i'll take 10 more i'll

872
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,000
take five more

873
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,880
don't

874
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,919
do that

875
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,600
because you can't handle all of that

876
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,080
you're not superman super person human

877
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,840
whatever you can't do it

878
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,520
you know there's a limit don't push past

879
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,480
your limit

880
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,440
know

881
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,919
your limits

882
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,279
plan a way to brief and debrief from

883
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,240
this

884
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,080
find a way that you can decompress when

885
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,520
this is done because it is going to end

886
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,918
and you need

887
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,919
you need a tactic to decompress from it

888
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,039
tactics not the word i was looking for

889
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,360
people right yeah um and then you have

890
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,039
to very important you have to understand

891
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,320
when your involvement is more of a

892
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,000
detriment than it is help

893
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,440
at a certain point

894
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,600
during digital dunkirk we basically had

895
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,440
to say hey look i'm sorry

896
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,520
you talking to me is now more dangerous

897
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,559
for you

898
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,799
than not talking to me

899
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,399
you're on your own i've done everything

900
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,440
i can

901
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,080
i cannot continue to do this it will get

902
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,520
you hurt

903
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
you have to know where the line is and

904
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,799
you have to understand where your

905
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,880
involvement is more dangerous than the

906
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,440
help that you're providing

907
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,360
yeah and just to kind of jump on that

908
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,520
that mainly comes from your support on

909
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,520
the ground right you don't get into

910
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,200
these operations typically when there's

911
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,440
nobody in country

912
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,240
um

913
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,880
they can happen we've seen them happen

914
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,600
but it's not very common right when

915
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,919
the ukrainian russian situation that's

916
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,320
been going on right there are people in

917
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,240
country actively trying to get some of

918
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,399
these individuals out so it's not like

919
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,840
hey

920
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,279
uh we have no assets there right so uh

921
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,520
just kind of think of it that way how

922
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,399
much how much support do you have

923
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,440
because if you start trying to help

924
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,039
these people and tell them to go places

925
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,840
and you have no eyes on the ground

926
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,440
how are you helping them

927
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,760
you know

928
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,720
oh

929
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,360
whoops next

930
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,840
okay

931
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,520
yeah we really need to find a slide for

932
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,600
that uh so consequences of bad

933
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,440
implementation or ttps when you're doing

934
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,520
or tactics techniques and procedures for

935
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,720
those who don't know what ttp is

936
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,440
hopefully that's everybody um

937
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,480
when when you're doing these kind of

938
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,240
operations and

939
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,799
you mess up right you have the potential

940
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,760
to lose your anonymity which is the most

941
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,200
important thing on the internet

942
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,039
especially when dealing with people who

943
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,480
do not like us

944
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,520
um

945
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
you could have the potential

946
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
of your privileged information being

947
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,440
disclosed or the individual that you're

948
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,679
trying to help is now disclosed to the

949
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,559
to the

950
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,679
public internet um you can compromise

951
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,600
multiple objectives that are in your

952
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,519
operation so this complete be things

953
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,559
like uh

954
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,640
safe houses or

955
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,440
routes that you're trying to move your

956
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,760
individuals in you can get harassment

957
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,679
from the baddies which is pretty common

958
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,640
right they if they're not going to

959
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,000
go after you they're probably just going

960
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,519
to harass you

961
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,159
and there is a true potential of loss of

962
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,159
life here especially when working with

963
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,120
higher

964
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,279
level adversaries that really just don't

965
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,519
care about how far their reach into the

966
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,240
world goes

967
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,840
i think this is still me yeah yeah so

968
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,440
the risk to you right

969
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,960
we've kind of talked about stock puppets

970
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,840
we kind of gave you an idea of how

971
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,720
you're going to build it but what is the

972
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,840
risk to you when you're when you're

973
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,640
operating than this uh it can be very

974
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,039
difficult to disconnect 100 from your

975
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,039
your sock puppet and somebody like the

976
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,919
us government or the russian or chinese

977
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,080
governments they do have the capability

978
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,880
to

979
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,679
go back and and figure out exactly where

980
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,960
you came from

981
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,799
right a sophisticated enough threat

982
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,799
actor or government

983
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,760
um

984
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,440
can still definitely find you network

985
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,200
traffic monitoring financial tracking

986
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,960
it's all out there we're very connected

987
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,480
we're a credit-based

988
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,159
economy now we're not a cash-based

989
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,559
economy right so think about that it's

990
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,559
on you guys to not get doxxed it's on

991
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,559
nobody else right it's not the guy who's

992
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,640
leading the operation to tell you okay

993
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,320
well maybe we shouldn't put our phone

994
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,799
number out on the public internet right

995
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,679
it's on you think about it um and like

996
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,679
we said the last thing what can what can

997
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,600
happen what can go wrong you get online

998
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,399
harassment travel uh restrictions

999
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,440
threats

1000
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,360
uh i'm pretty sure i'm banned from quite

1001
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,120
a few countries and that's probably not

1002
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,159
because of this but for other reasons um

1003
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,000
and then for all you fed boys and girls

1004
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,120
out there

1005
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,799
clearance implications right a lot of

1006
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,480
people that we worked with in this

1007
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,919
engagement

1008
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,080
we're like fbi cid osi military

1009
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,880
government right you name it

1010
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,039
this is technically not allowed

1011
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,159
by any means if you're going to

1012
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,440
communicate with the terrorist threat

1013
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,159
you have to put it on your sf-86

1014
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,919
it's out there right and that can cause

1015
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,679
clearance implications and it did happen

1016
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,600
we had one guy that

1017
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,279
uh he was working with one of his

1018
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,960
contacts his contact goes through a

1019
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,440
checkpoint phone gets picked up

1020
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,840
last number gets dialed old boy picks up

1021
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,240
the phone and now he's talking with

1022
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,480
the taliban the taliban whoever it was

1023
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,320
well now technically have you ever been

1024
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,440
in communication with a terrorist

1025
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,000
organization is uh ah yeah technically

1026
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,519
yeah i got to check that box on my

1027
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,600
security clearance forms try explaining

1028
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,919
that so there are clearance implications

1029
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,039
for anybody that does i'm not going to

1030
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,039
ask you to put your hands up because

1031
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,200
spot the fed's not working today

1032
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,960
uh there are clearance implications it

1033
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,440
can't happen

1034
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,440
this was you

1035
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,840
hey so we talked very briefly about

1036
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,039
rebecca um

1037
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,320
this is just a lady that wanted to get

1038
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,480
involved she had no prior experience

1039
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,519
with any military technical she's not a

1040
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,200
security person she's not a hacker she

1041
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,519
was i think she was a dental assistant

1042
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,399
if i'm

1043
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,760
guessing right if i'm remembering that

1044
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,399
right

1045
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,000
yeah some sort of medical assistant she

1046
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,960
just found out about it through a friend

1047
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,760
through a friend through a friend i want

1048
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
to get involved and she was killing it

1049
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,239
she was helping us she was doing great

1050
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,000
except some of this stuff happened

1051
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,760
the the taliban confiscated her

1052
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,199
contact's phone

1053
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,040
searched her phone number problem here

1054
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,599
is she's using her personal phone number

1055
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,119
this is why we talked earlier about

1056
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,560
don't do that

1057
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,719
so now she's getting calls and texts and

1058
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,719
messages and whatsapp and all kinds of

1059
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,960
stuff directly from

1060
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,560
some taliban goon at a checkpoint

1061
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,159
this is a problem right they found her

1062
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,839
facebook profile they found that where

1063
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,320
she lived how many kids she had they

1064
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,440
found all this information and they're

1065
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,199
harassing her they're threatening her

1066
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,639
and her children

1067
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,000
it's unfortunate it's sad it's

1068
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,639
terrifying this is why

1069
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,719
we wrap it up

1070
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,239
yeah she went through this for like

1071
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,119
weeks

1072
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,079
right um the entire team had to after

1073
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,000
the operation had to like help her

1074
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,680
secure her facebook right lock

1075
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
everything down remove information from

1076
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,760
the internet there's a lot more like

1077
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,240
time implication to to kind of

1078
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,000
disconnect her a little bit more cancel

1079
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,680
her phone number and then go get a new

1080
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,760
one right through through a whole

1081
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,400
different service but ultimately

1082
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,920
at the time the taliban was in a

1083
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,119
position to come over to the united

1084
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,320
states and start whacking people

1085
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,599
thankfully but i don't really think

1086
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,079
they're in a position now to to be

1087
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,920
honest but

1088
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,599
i mean how many of you guys would like

1089
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,520
being called day in and day out by some

1090
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,839
guy in afghanistan threatening to kill

1091
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,359
you your kids

1092
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:35,200
your your husband your wife whoever it

1093
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,880
may be right

1094
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,359
it's not fun it's not enjoyable it's

1095
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,400
probably

1096
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,599
terrifying

1097
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,000
individuals on a less serious well i

1098
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,320
guess less high serious implications

1099
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,920
note it took time away from our

1100
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,000
operation because we had to stop

1101
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,359
communicating with our contacts and

1102
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,640
finding people and tracking people and

1103
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,560
go all right becky sit down here's how

1104
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,160
we're going to lock your stuff up

1105
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,599
and we had to spend a couple of days

1106
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,839
away from our actual operation in order

1107
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,880
to help her get herself locked up better

1108
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,560
so there are implications to her there's

1109
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,079
implications to the entire operation as

1110
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,160
a whole

1111
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,118
this is why we use fake information

1112
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,839
really becky docks herself at the end of

1113
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,040
the day

1114
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,480
it was rough though i mean we make a

1115
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,240
joke about it but it's still it's not a

1116
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,640
fun situation to be in

1117
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,040
so uh the next example here is bobby

1118
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,720
tables um

1119
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,960
not confirmed on his last name though uh

1120
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,800
this guy was a prior government employee

1121
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,640
he he was pretty good technical honors

1122
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,480
it's not to say that like having

1123
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,320
technical knowledge means that you know

1124
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,000
what you're doing we've seen plenty of

1125
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,320
it admins put their normal user account

1126
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,400
in enterprise admins right we've all

1127
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,440
been there maybe um github secret key

1128
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,920
talk guy but you know you have a better

1129
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,760
idea of what you're supposed to do with

1130
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,920
like vpns and disconnection and all that

1131
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,200
jazz uh his big thing though is this is

1132
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,480
a guy who would raise his hand in the

1133
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,079
middle of our ops brief every day and be

1134
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,920
like i want more contacts at the end of

1135
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,720
it he had like 50 55 contacts it was

1136
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,000
insane um but this but this guy

1137
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
took all those contacts wrapped them up

1138
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,920
into one chat and was directing all of

1139
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,880
these 55 individuals to a safe house now

1140
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,720
the safe house that we had just got

1141
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,839
stood up

1142
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:16,880
uh

1143
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,800
we crowdsourced the money to about 15k

1144
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,599
right

1145
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,160
uh and this dude is like hey i need you

1146
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,320
guys all to go over here they're all in

1147
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,520
different regions it's not like they're

1148
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,359
all in the same place not everybody's in

1149
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,280
kabul right so he's like i need to get

1150
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,839
on like highway 101 just drive up north

1151
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,880
um

1152
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,119
so he told where the the save house was

1153
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,520
one of the uh the contacts him and his

1154
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,440
family got captured by the taliban the

1155
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
taliban did ssi which is a military

1156
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,680
thing of just stripping everything off

1157
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,760
of you and doing intelligence figuring

1158
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,800
out who what when this thing uh they

1159
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,960
found the group chat off of whatsapp

1160
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,040
realized where this safe house was and

1161
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,359
then they raided the safe house

1162
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,440
right so

1163
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,359
the rest of those individuals that were

1164
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,200
going there that's 15k out the door

1165
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,440
we're not getting that back i guarantee

1166
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,440
you that uh we didn't get any of that

1167
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,599
money back and now we have to find close

1168
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,160
to 100 individuals a place to stay while

1169
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,000
we figure out exactly how we're gonna

1170
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,960
get them out of country so taking too

1171
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,760
much at once while it may seem like hey

1172
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,960
i can handle this it's just a computer

1173
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,480
it's just a phone number

1174
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,720
it's it's a lot harder than you think

1175
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,960
and the other thing about bobby here is

1176
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
that not only did he blow all of our

1177
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,119
safe house information he blew all of

1178
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,200
the information for every other person

1179
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,640
in that chat

1180
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,000
so if every single one of you is in a

1181
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,160
group chat with me do you trust me

1182
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,920
not to get my phone compromised

1183
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,800
otherwise you're all in trouble

1184
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,839
don't

1185
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,520
it's not a good idea so every single

1186
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,119
person in that group chat then had their

1187
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,760
information available to guys that are

1188
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,920
looking for them so yeah bobby blew our

1189
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,880
safe house but that was probably going

1190
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
to happen anyway the problem is

1191
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,160
bobby blew all these other people that

1192
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,880
are moving around trying to get out

1193
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,040
yeah it's it's fun times you know good

1194
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,320
times with bobby tables he's always

1195
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,119
screwing stuff up

1196
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,040
yeah this slide's real short uh the

1197
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,240
consequences of doing it right are

1198
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,320
really short uh you didn't screw up

1199
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,280
good job

1200
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,119
uh you didn't get doxxed you got your

1201
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,160
mission done

1202
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,520
any sort of problems and hiccups and

1203
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,280
issues you guys have are easy to move

1204
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,400
through and

1205
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,960
fix on the way there's not a lot here do

1206
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,320
it right and there's not a lot on the

1207
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,320
slide

1208
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,480
this one's good so this is again a fake

1209
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,000
name fake face we put the black bar over

1210
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,280
it because it vaguely resembles one of

1211
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,200
our friends from a prior life

1212
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,079
uh

1213
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,760
pedro here is prior military high

1214
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,880
technical knowledge knows how to

1215
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,960
implement opsec which i realize now we

1216
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,480
haven't said out loud yet opsec is

1217
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,720
operational security it's the concept of

1218
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,119
protecting your operation

1219
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,640
without going into a three-hour

1220
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,800
powerpoint slide brief about opsec

1221
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,960
speaking of which yeah all right cool

1222
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,320
um so he had a little bit of prior

1223
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,000
experience i'm not saying that in order

1224
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,839
to do this you have to have prior

1225
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:01,839
military experience i'm saying that he

1226
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,079
happened to have the information because

1227
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,599
of where he came from

1228
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,119
um he helped us establish the

1229
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,960
communication with a bunch of contacts

1230
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,800
again unlike bobby he knew how to do it

1231
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,599
right

1232
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,200
he separated them all he segregated him

1233
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,560
he kept them all away from each other

1234
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,079
they didn't know about each other

1235
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,560
um this guy's done several successful

1236
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,440
ops in this same kind of realm

1237
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,960
um i don't even know what they all are i

1238
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,280
don't know this guy's name i i don't i

1239
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,560
don't know who this actually is i've got

1240
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,240
a couple of handles for him that's it i

1241
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,839
don't even know who this is he knows how

1242
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,440
to secure himself he knows how to build

1243
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,280
sock puppets he might be a sock puppet i

1244
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
don't know

1245
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,920
but this is a good implementation

1246
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,000
yeah i i mean it's hard to kind of

1247
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,160
expand on this right like if if you know

1248
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,520
you know if you don't know you don't

1249
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,119
know and which is ultimately why we're

1250
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,200
trying to tell you guys this today there

1251
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,240
are

1252
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,400
ways of doing this safely by

1253
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,200
implementing basic security hygiene on

1254
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,640
top of what you're doing when you're

1255
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,760
building out a uh a sock puppet

1256
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,720
so you know be like pedro be a homie

1257
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,720
uh he didn't go by gabe unfortunately

1258
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,560
like everybody else in the group

1259
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,839
but um

1260
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,480
he's pretty cool

1261
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,920
this one's fun so when you're done with

1262
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,440
this burn it down right get rid of it

1263
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,280
destroy everything snap your phone sim

1264
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,560
if you have a physical phone delete your

1265
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,319
virtual machines format your hard drives

1266
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,160
close your accounts i am a hillbilly

1267
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,160
from montana anybody else like shooting

1268
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,640
at hard drives

1269
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,680
no cool all right jethro it is yeah pet

1270
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,560
your dog call your therapist man burn it

1271
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,280
down you're done now shut the door get

1272
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,640
rid of everything that can potentially

1273
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,960
tie you back forensically or

1274
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,640
be tempted to pick up this old email

1275
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,839
address and read through the stuff that

1276
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,359
you get rid of it

1277
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,160
burn it all of it be gone

1278
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,440
yeah i mean the only thing we kept from

1279
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,200
this operation is that first photo of

1280
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,359
gabe er you know the fake friends and

1281
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,560
fine people um i

1282
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,920
ultimately this is the thing that most

1283
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,440
people find hardest to give up i don't

1284
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,800
know what it is about tech people but we

1285
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,640
are always so proud of like what we

1286
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,079
built we're like but look at it man

1287
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,079
dump it you don't need it what are you

1288
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,920
gonna do with it it's like those dvi

1289
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,800
cables why do you still have dvi cables

1290
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,280
i know you all have dv vga who still has

1291
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,520
a vga cable in here yeah i see a few

1292
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,200
hands throw them away throw them away

1293
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,160
who uses vga anymore

1294
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,560
yeah for server racks yeah yeah all

1295
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,160
right you get a pass you get you get a

1296
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,359
pad yep

1297
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,160
get the get the rack a little pull out

1298
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,560
you don't need it

1299
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,079
so here's our down and dirty review you

1300
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,760
know the really quick things you should

1301
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,760
know what a sock puppet is you don't

1302
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,000
need to know exactly you know everything

1303
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,079
about it we do highly recommend that you

1304
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,359
go out and read a little bit more of how

1305
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,800
to do this

1306
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,599
in other techniques and tactics

1307
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,119
you have an idea of when to use them

1308
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,040
when you're not being a criminal

1309
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,400
um

1310
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,240
what else we got you know where to start

1311
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,359
cash a card remember always pick that up

1312
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,280
silly techniques how to build one keep

1313
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,359
it fun keep it light enjoy what you're

1314
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,960
doing at the end of the day you're not

1315
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,560
getting into a humanitarian op because

1316
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,560
you're like you have to do it like oh

1317
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,160
man bob told me i have to go do a

1318
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,000
humanitarian up today like you're doing

1319
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,400
it because you want to do it so have fun

1320
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,560
when you get into this process

1321
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,760
know how to use them know what you're

1322
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,960
doing

1323
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,240
you know the differences between good

1324
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,760
and bad implementations and hopefully

1325
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,760
none of you guys make the same mistakes

1326
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,560
as becky or bobby tables

1327
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,920
and you should have somewhat of an

1328
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,280
understanding of inherent risk when it

1329
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,599
comes down to messing with nation state

1330
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,800
actors or

1331
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,720
uh terrorist organizations

1332
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,960
and at that point

1333
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,599
we'll leave it up to any questions

1334
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,240
we got one in the back

1335
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,200
yeah i mean i don't think you

1336
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,880
necessarily have to wait the full two

1337
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,480
year mark but but basically for those

1338
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,960
who couldn't hear um you know it's like

1339
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,800
in order to kind of get into this

1340
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,200
field this realm of activist activity uh

1341
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,520
you want to start building your profiles

1342
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,839
now and over the course of a couple

1343
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,760
months you can have a plethora of

1344
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,720
different faces uh you know a split

1345
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,119
personality in on the internet

1346
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,760
uh to say but yeah i i would say give it

1347
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,079
a good stock puppet six to six months to

1348
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,200
a year is is a solid disconnect and very

1349
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,079
who you're trying to make right so i've

1350
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,520
got one in eastern europe i've got one

1351
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,599
in south korea i've got one in england

1352
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,680
i've got one in mexico

1353
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,880
because you never know what's gonna pop

1354
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,760
up

1355
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
and you're not gonna be able to use

1356
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,760
i think we said gabe used to live in

1357
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,520
kabul and then he moved to

1358
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,520
boston or something something weird like

1359
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,440
that that's not going to help me

1360
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,160
in colombia

1361
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,160
make a bunch of them

1362
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,480
sit them on a shelf have the tools ready

1363
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,640
but yeah to your point make several make

1364
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,160
them over the course of time and have

1365
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,760
them on the shelf and ready very where

1366
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,040
they are

1367
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,560
what they look like what their names are

1368
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,640
where they live what they do

1369
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,240
give yourself some variability to work

1370
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,240
with

1371
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,680
yeah you like one go nuts

1372
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,440
oh that that works out perfectly yeah

1373
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,640
hey um

1374
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,640
so if you have a sock puppets that have

1375
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,640
a lot of friend requests is it good to

1376
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,319
accept those because you want to have a

1377
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,079
lot of friends or is it better to be

1378
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,480
cautious about whom you accept

1379
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,319
i say hit them all right sometimes a

1380
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,839
good a good technique when you're when

1381
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,119
you're building out a sock puppet

1382
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,800
especially on something like facebook or

1383
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,800
linkedin is to have some sort of buffer

1384
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,800
room because nobody's gonna believe that

1385
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,560
that gabe here with two friends is a

1386
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,359
real person right like oh that seems a

1387
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,839
little weird so uh you know you go on

1388
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,599
fiverr spend like three bucks and get

1389
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,920
like three thousand friends it's my

1390
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,400
favorite way of making friends

1391
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,000
um

1392
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
yeah it's my only way of making friends

1393
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,960
uh but no i i t to your question i think

1394
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,960
that it's better to have

1395
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,160
a larger range of of numbers right

1396
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,960
instead of just having one or two z uh

1397
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,720
sock puppets it's gonna make it more

1398
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,319
believable sorry and one more question

1399
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,079
um what are some common

1400
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,040
fingerprinting um location geolocation

1401
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,040
slip ups that you've seen

1402
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,599
uh you mean like with people like active

1403
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,440
in the environment they'll just screw up

1404
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,760
uh the fun one i think is usually your

1405
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,440
phone number right if you're calling

1406
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,079
from a plus one number in a plus four

1407
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,280
one area like afghanistan uh that stands

1408
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,760
out big time when somebody's doing ssi

1409
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,560
on

1410
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,480
the uh on the phones right they're like

1411
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,040
ah plus four one plus four one plus

1412
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,480
plus one

1413
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,560

personality that's been made five years

1445

and spend 17 hours a day on facebook

1459
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,119
maintaining seven personalities

1460
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,040
uh i can't i can't do it i spend zero

1461
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,720
hours on facebook

1462
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,280
i don't i don't do it um

1463
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,040
i build personalities

1464
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,720
occasionally i'll pop in and post a

1465
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,079
photo from wherever i'm supposed to be

1466
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,000
from you don't have to be this very

1467
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,680
super super active

1468
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,520
uh facebook personality in order for a

1469
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,720
lot of this stuff to work we are looking

1470
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,839
for a cursory glance does it pass

1471
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:50,800
so

1472
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,559
if somebody looks at my profile they're

1473
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:53,920
probably not going to spend two hours

1474
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,680
scrolling my entire photo feed and

1475
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,200
looking at all of my birthday photos

1476
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,000
they're not going to do it they're going

1477
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,960
to look they're going to be like yep

1478
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,880
gabe move

1479
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,319
they might look at how old the profile

1480
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,160
is zero friends

1481
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,960
200 friends whatever couple of photos

1482
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,400
how old is it

1483
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,920
where's the phone number from it's a

1484
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,280
cursory glance because at the end of the

1485
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,240
day you're throwing this thing away

1486
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,440
anyway

1487
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,720
um but yeah i i cannot afford to spend

1488
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,040
so much time on facebook maintaining

1489
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,480
eight 10 12 profiles

1490
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,000
something i'll do

1491
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,559
python's really cool right just scrape

1492
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,319
everything from a country and just

1493
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,520
repost it it sounds dumb right they're

1494
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,040
like hey happy birthday to rodrigo and

1495
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,319
you're like you don't even have a friend

1496
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,400
named rodrigo dude and you're like yeah

1497
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,319
whatever

1498
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,400
right it's that cursory glance right if

1499
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,319
the twitter feed is completely empty

1500
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:47,119
who's gonna follow it realistically

1501
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,520
uh other than maybe going on fiverr

1502
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,400
um

1503
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
you know i i think the best way

1504
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,440
typically to mimic behavior is to

1505
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,520
just gather up as much as you can and

1506
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,960
just dump it over time

1507
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,119
i think we have time for five more

1508
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,440
what's up

1509
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:10,800
it's kind of cool that they're running

1510
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,079
around with the mics now we can actually

1511
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,599
hear

1512
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,520
uh i had a quick whoa that's a lot i had

1513
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,160
a question about um your distributed

1514
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,559
kind of resources for this operation i

1515
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,920
would imagine like

1516
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,359
one of them was so good at being a sock

1517
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,680
pocket sock puppet they seem like a sock

1518
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,000
puppet themselves like how are you maybe

1519
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,559
not how but like did you verify like

1520
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:31,920
that they could be

1521
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,720
useful assets for this operation

1522
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,359
and like how difficult was that given

1523
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:38,240
that

1524
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,200
necessarily meeting in a room um also i

1525
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,280
know if you like guys watch work watch

1526
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,720
workaholics but you guys definitely got

1527
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,160
a blake anderson

1528
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,000
and uh design thing going on here and i

1529
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,680
really appreciate it

1530
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,960
yeah i've gotten the blake anderson

1531
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,720
comment quite a few times i think my ceo

1532
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,319
tells me i'm blake anderson almost every

1533
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,359
other day

1534
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,280
um

1535
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,880
so just to make sure i'm i'm

1536
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,160
understanding your question correctly

1537
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,800
it's how do we verify our

1538
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,839
stockpop is going to work in country

1539
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,640
yeah so

1540
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,040
most of the people that we have worked

1541
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:17,839
with

1542
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,920
right uh most of those people come from

1543
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,520
the soft community the one thing that

1544
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,520
you can trust the military

1545
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,000
veterans to do is

1546
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
we don't ever

1547
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,680
leave that lifestyle right when we're

1548
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,800
done we're like oh yeah cool i can make

1549
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,880
real money now

1550
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,200
but i'm not doing anything

1551
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,079
so

1552
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,319
you know like with afghanistan popping

1553
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,839
off like i was asked if i wanted to go

1554
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,760
in country and verify people

1555
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,640
uh

1556
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,559
if i could bring a gun sure but if i

1557
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,440
couldn't nah right and so a lot of the

1558
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,359
contacts that we know

1559
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,880
are just prior contacts that we've

1560
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,440
worked with um sometimes you'll fall

1561
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,960
into an operation especially with like

1562
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,920
ukraine russia situation where

1563
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,079
you have a dude that's vouching for

1564
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,520
another dude

1565
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,760
right uh it's almost uh robert downing

1566
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,280
jr from uh

1567
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,359
what is that movie thunder

1568
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,079
whatever but yeah you get the idea it's

1569
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,319
like a dude playing a dude this guy's

1570
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,839
another dude right like it's just

1571
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,920
verification through trusted channels

1572
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,760
that you're working with to where you

1573
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,000
can go i trust this guy like our safe

1574
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,880
house

1575
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,440
the dude that set up our safe house was

1576
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,000
some guy who bought lumber for us

1577
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,160
for like three years and we're like can

1578
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,400
you just dump a bunch of money into this

1579
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,040
hotel and tell them to not ask questions

1580
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,880
they were like yeah all right cool and

1581
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,800
so that's how we were setting up a lot

1582
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
of resources so it's it's more of like

1583
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,400
trusting who is vouching for the

1584
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,720
individual then you are trusting who the

1585
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,720
individual is

1586
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,240
so especially with verification

1587
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,480
processes it's like hey let's get on

1588
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,200
whatsapp show me your face right you can

1589
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,119
do a video call over the internet uh

1590
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,880
it's not going to cost you a dime

1591
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,880
so do a video call here's your face

1592
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,559
here's your passport i know you are you

1593
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,640
are you distressed no all right throw

1594
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,079
your phone around the room let me make

1595
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,880
sure cool we verified you let's continue

1596
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,119
so it is a little bit of a process but

1597
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,319
if you're working with individuals

1598
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,079
who've done this before they should be

1599
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,119
helping you learn a little bit

1600
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,119
uh another another kind of way that

1601
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,880
you'll see it done is

1602
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,359
we're going to protect us

1603
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,359
so i'm not going to talk to you

1604
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,520
my puppet's going to talk to your puppet

1605
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,520
so i've defended myself and you in that

1606
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,839
way

1607
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,839
okay

1608
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,760
and that helps to keep you safe from the

1609
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,760
other people inside that organization

1610
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,280
now that's not to say that the other

1611
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,559
people in your organization have been

1612
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,079
vetted to be functional and useful and

1613
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,480
ready to go but i have defended myself

1614
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,720
against that by saying

1615
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,720
timmy and gabe are going to talk you

1616
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,160
don't know my name i don't know yours

1617
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,279
that's fine we're going to be gabe

1618
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,839
okay

1619
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:59,040
cool they're running with the mic

1620
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,319
you look gorgeous

1621
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,400
knock it off asking from kind of a

1622
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,280
volunteer management position during

1623
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,640
operation no

1624
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,319
operation digital dunkirk there was a

1625
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,480
lot of misinformation going around from

1626
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,880
taliban twitter accounts or is being

1627
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,960
interpreted by unexpected inexperienced

1628
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,200
volunteers not understanding the slang

1629
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,640
that was involved or just setting things

1630
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,000
through google transit tran translator

1631
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,640
do you have any recommendations for when

1632
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,040
you're leading a group of volunteers

1633
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,400
such as this for helping to manage

1634
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,480
that very reactive

1635
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,240
mode that it's easy to get into when

1636
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,680
working on operations such as this

1637
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,359
you got an answer for that one i got

1638
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:46,000
some bad answers for that one

1639
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,720
so

1640
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,119
the the one thing that i learned in the

1641
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,960
military with like the ic community is

1642
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,400
everything is take everything with a

1643
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,119
grain of salt right what you've heard

1644
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,520
from one source needs to be confirmed

1645
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,760
through several sources you can't just

1646
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,160
have a single source of truth uh it's

1647
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,880
not

1648
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,000
you know it's like if you were to take

1649
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
solarwinds approach on on when they got

1650
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,599
hacked oh we're not hacked like

1651
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:08,720
everybody else is saying you're hacked

1652
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,599
bro um so take everything that you get

1653
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,599
with a grain of salt and understand that

1654
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,559
what you see may not exactly be what is

1655
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,359
happening uh the russia ukraine

1656
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,960
situation is a great example of why

1657
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,559
propaganda works

1658
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,760
right because russia's like we're not

1659
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,880
killing anybody and ukraine's like

1660
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,640
you're killing everybody same thing with

1661
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,160
the taliban taliban's like we're not

1662
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,440
shooting anybody and the next thing you

1663
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,680
see is a video out there of them blowing

1664
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,799
up the uh

1665
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,119
the north end gate of the airport

1666
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,079
so

1667
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,240
um when you're working in these and

1668
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,839
you're brand new the biggest thing

1669
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,440
everything is a grain of salt don't

1670
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,960
trust anything you see until you have

1671
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,200
multiple sources that confirm exactly

1672
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,680
that fact and any other fact that isn't

1673
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,160
confirmed within the statements should

1674
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,599
be just taken as

1675
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,880
probably false

1676
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,440
right error of caution there

1677
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,280
great question though

1678
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,319
we got one right here where's our i

1679
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,160
think we have time for one more or no

1680
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,440
maybe a question okay we got we got time

1681
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,160
for one last

1682
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,760
what is that i'm forgetting what the

1683
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,920
site is

1684
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,319
so i've purchased a cell number is there

1685
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,880
a workaround for like the geo location

1686
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,359
like from the you know ping to the tower

1687
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,359
uh geo locating me somewhere else than

1688
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:28,640
where i want to be

1689
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,760
blue

1690
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,319
okay thanks yeah no i would say going

1691
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,160
through bluehost and changing there it's

1692
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,520
really

1693
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,520
you can root the phone

1694
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,480
and then

1695
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,240
spoof your your position your

1696
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,280
geolocation but it is it is iffy like if

1697
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,000
it's a sophisticated enough threat actor

1698
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,200
they're gonna be like yeah we know

1699
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,400
what's going on

1700
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,079
so same idea with like mac address

1701
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,559
spoofing

1702
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,280
but uh i think that's our time so thank

1703
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,520
you everyone you know party hard don't

1704
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,760
do drugs we're not your dad

1705
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,960
