buying security a client's guide and

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,679
today we're going to be talking about

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,680
how to buy and get value from security

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,520
services vendors specifically around

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,600
security assessments

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,720
um

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,439
hi i'm rami uh i do not work at twilio

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,240
i'm at a series d health tech unicorn

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,880
out in new york city i'm based in boston

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,000
um

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,079
i am what i call a reformed security

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,600
consultant so i have experience both

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,399
buying and selling these assessments uh

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,760
and i just want to give a quick thanks

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,239
to tldrsek and my friend clint who

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,120
worked with me a lot on this content

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
more on that in one second

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,440
so quick heads up you do not have to

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,199
worry about taking notes and photos i

25
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,879
made this super dense there are a lot of

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,920
references there are a lot of call outs

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,440
these slides will be published after the

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,520
talk a link will be available at the end

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,760
and clint and i have put up a long form

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
version of this guide on tl dr sec that

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,600
you can read at your leisure in the

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
future as well and of course the talk is

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
being recorded um so feel free to take

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,880
pictures but don't stress about it

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
so why are we here why do i feel this is

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,799
important you can't buy security right

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,560
it's not something you can purchase but

38
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,880
security services are a really important

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,799
part of security programs especially as

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,560
your company grows you'll need

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,000
capabilities that you don't have

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,759
in-house you'll need to scale your

43
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,680
program in a flexible way

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,360
you'll need a third-party validation of

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,920
the quality of your program and shopping

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,759
for and deriving value is therefore a

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,520
core competency for a lot of security

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,040
engineers

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,600
but organizations struggle it's a really

50
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,360
hard thing to do when you're doing it

51
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,960
maybe once a year maybe you've never

52
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,560
done it before

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,479
there's information asymmetry there's

54
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,399
difficulty assessing performance of a

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,479
vendor or quality of your assessment

56
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,720
there's infrequent or limited awareness

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
of just the breadth of this industry and

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,320
the services on offer

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,240
there's frankly misleading sales tactics

60
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,920
and a lack of standardization or quality

61
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,240
on delivery across the board so it's

62
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,399
really easy to buy a dud

63
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,600
and there are

64
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
a lot more alternatives nowadays that

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,920
make it harder and harder to navigate

66
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,360
this marketplace

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,840
so we're gonna dive into it um hard to

68
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
say better than the survey respondent

69
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
and a little programming note more on

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,120
the survey in a second but when you see

71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,440
this logo on the top left

72
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
that is all sourced from the security

73
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
community who participated in this

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
survey

75
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
it's also just a big industry like

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,640
security services are almost 100 billion

77
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,480
dollars i know in these rooms at these

78
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
conferences we can feel like a small

79
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,239
community and i love that but there's a

80
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,920
lot of money in security services and

81
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,200
that means there are a lot of competing

82
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,599
interests at play

83
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,200
so today we're going to talk about

84
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
buying security assessments as a narrow

85
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
lens to look at the security services

86
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,720
industry as a whole

87
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,640
security assessments just in case you

88
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,239
you know don't have the definition off

89
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,400
hand there's the nist version

90
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,640
it's all about assessing

91
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
architecture implemented controls and

92
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,159
really just making sure your security

93
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,319
program is accomplishing its goals and

94
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,680
meeting your security requirements

95
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
so what do we get over the next you know

96
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,840
40 or so minutes um

97
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
i've synthesized 200 resources on the

98
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
topic from all across the internet

99
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
i surveyed over 100 security

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
professionals in collaboration with

101
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,000
tldrsec and we've put together a

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,239
comprehensive guide on dying and buying

103
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,480
and getting value from these services my

104
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,239
goal is to use this to work together and

105
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,000
like really continue the conversation

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,239
about how we as an industry procure

107
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,599
assessments and then use them to

108
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,360
measurably reduce risk because that's

109
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,080
what it's all about

110
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,959
so numerous sources just wanted to throw

111
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,720
up some logos quickly we stand on the

112
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
shoulders of giants there's been lots of

113
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,879
writing and thinking on this topic from

114
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,959
pen test vendors as content marketing

115
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,319
from standards groups government

116
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,200
organizations conferences academics

117
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,040
a full bibliography and citations will

118
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,439
be up with the guide as well in case you

119
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,599
want to dive more into this

120
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,200
and about the survey

121
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,560
this was circulated throughout the

122
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
security community slack groups networks

123
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,080
tldr sec again we had over 100

124
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,720
respondents 71 of whom were buyers and

125
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,760
68 were sellers with a lot of overlap

126
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,759
and it was basically a 20 question

127
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,680
survey about buying and a 20 question

128
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,759
survey about selling just trying to get

129
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
some frankly quantitative sampling bias

130
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
present data from the community at large

131
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,040
beyond you know what we were reading and

132
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,479
what our personal experiences were

133
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,800
and like here's some of what we were

134
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,080
surveying right

135
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,320
if you look we had representation across

136
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,639
industries obviously professional

137
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,160
services are really well represented

138
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,759
when you're interviewing folks who work

139
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,840
at security consultancies

140
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,479
but also a big representation from

141
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,479
like the information industry financial

142
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,479
industries as well

143
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,800
and companies of all size right about

144
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,320
half folks worked at companies with more

145
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,120
than 500 employees but uh you know a

146
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,320
broad array of folks represented and uh

147
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,400
procuring when you're under 10 folks is

148
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,759
definitely different than when you're

149
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,800
over 500 so sort of a broad swath of the

150
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,440
industry here

151
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,360
and i just wanted to talk about like how

152
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
much coverage do we get we only talk to

153
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,720
100 folks obviously it's limited but

154
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
together and this is a logarithmic scale

155
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,840
we have coverage of over 1 300 purchase

156
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,400
security assessments and over 25 000

157
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,639
sold and that's like especially on the

158
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,080
right hand here you have some folks

159
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,440
selling 5 000 security assessments which

160
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,160
is a bonkers number to me um so i went

161
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,680
and checked into it and i will say these

162
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
are folks who have like 10 to 20 years

163
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,000
running a consultancy or sales for one

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,080
um and they just have this wealth of

165
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,800
experience that we were able to tap

166
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,199
so like why are we here why am i

167
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,880
entering with this presumption that this

168
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
is hard

169
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,320
well i really latched on to this idea

170
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,520
from haroon's 2012 2011 talk

171
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,639
some of you have seen it others should

172
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
he comes up with this concept of

173
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,800
security pen testing companies as a

174
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
market for lemons

175
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,720
it's a

176
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,479
economics paper that talks about

177
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,319
marketplaces and it says basically if

178
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,400
you're selling used cars you have good

179
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
cars which are cherries and bad cars

180
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,120
which are lemons and if in the market

181
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
both exist buyers have to average their

182
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
expectations they don't want to like be

183
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,240
paying cherry money for a lemon and so

184
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,319
slowly folks will take cherries off the

185
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,560
market and only be selling lemons and

186
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,639
this is like how information asymmetry

187
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,479
where buyers can't trust that they're

188
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,400
getting a quality product can really

189
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,240
just degrade the quality of the industry

190
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,560
as a whole and i think and haroon does

191
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
as well or at least did in 2012 that

192
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,880
this is emblematic of security services

193
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,240
buyers don't trust they're getting a

194
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,160
good quality product and so they average

195
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,240
their expectations and so we're slowly

196
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,319
moving to sort of the least common

197
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,560
denominator product

198
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,800
even in 2007

199
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,400
we were talking about this

200
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
gary mcgraw likes to refer to pen

201
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,840
testing security assessments as a

202
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,160
badnesso meter right on one hand you

203
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,240
have like you and your security program

204
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,160
suck and on the other you have well i

205
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,919
guess we don't know

206
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,280
there's no winning in security

207
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,199
assessments you can't prove a negative

208
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,880
there's no way to say there are no holes

209
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
there are no vulnerabilities there is no

210
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
risk all you can say is that in the

211
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
target scope with the time allotted we

212
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,160
didn't find any um so this is hard this

213
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,919
makes it a really hard like product to

214
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,199
buy because

215
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,440
is a blank report a good thing or not

216
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,039
what about one with a lot of findings

217
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,479
right like what are you actually looking

218
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,520
for how are you assessing quality

219
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,400
and

220
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,919
how do people feel about the quality of

221
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
the marketplace right here's a here's a

222
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,840
statement we made and got some you know

223
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,960
how much do you agree with this

224
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,440
statement metrics um the average answer

225
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,039
you know a normal distribution right

226
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
around to 2.9

227
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,039
this was the same for folks who had done

228
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,759
both buying and selling agreed

229
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,759
but when you slice the data by buyers

230
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,199
and sellers you see a shift

231
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,440
buyers actually have a higher confidence

232
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
in average quality

233
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
and frankly i actually think this is a

234
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,400
problem i trust the sellers here who are

235
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,080
likely more informed on the industry and

236
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,360
the offerings

237
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,599
obviously with some biases and i think

238
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,199
that this is evidence of like some

239
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,199
issues where buyers are overconfident in

240
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,400
the quality of the services they're

241
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,360
receiving or unable to dig into the

242
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,759
quality

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,680
and similarly concerningly um like

244
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,520
the output of a security assessment is

245
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,159
probably some risks uh and some advice

246
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,519
on what your priorities should be and

247
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,320
what the risk level is and there isn't

248
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,159
like this overwhelming consensus that

249
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,399
risks are appropriately graded we'll

250
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,159
talk later about how to account for this

251
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,839
discrepancy um but you really uh would

252
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,360
hope that we could trust that vendors

253
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,880
are working in your business context

254
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
giving you like well-groomed risks that

255
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
you can immediately apply and that's

256
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
just not the case currently

257
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,000
so

258
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
we'll dig into more challenges as we go

259
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,160
um but i want to talk about how we can

260
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,279
do better at buying security assessments

261
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,519
it's certainly generalizable but much

262
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,040
easier to carve a slice out and talk

263
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
about it in specifics here

264
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,120
and i stole this diagram from patrick

265
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,959
who i believe is somewhere around b-side

266
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,440
so if you see him thank him for me

267
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
but there are a lot of types of security

268
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,279
assessments out there he slices it along

269
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,440
scope and

270
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,839
the level of visibility given to testers

271
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,440
there are a lot of other ways you can

272
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,640
slice it

273
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,160
but i just like this to show that like

274
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,000
when you're buying an assessment there

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,080
are a lot of things that could mean and

276
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,839
you should probably know which one you

277
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,720
want before you talk to a vendor

278
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,160
here's a different breakdown right we

279
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
have vulnerability assessments threat

280
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,000
modeling red teaming social engineering

281
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
white box testing is dominant this is

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,720
actually interesting outside the talk

283
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,160
this wasn't always the case and there's

284
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
been a big push by security services

285
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,880
vendors to get more access a lot of

286
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
clients historically don't want to give

287
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
you access to source code or their

288
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
systems through fears of the risk

289
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
involved but it does let you get much

290
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,920
more efficient thorough comprehensive

291
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,839
testing done for cheaper

292
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,120
so it was actually good to see that

293
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,399
reflected

294
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,920
and then you can see there's a long tail

295
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
of all sorts of assessments represented

296
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,079
here

297
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,480
and big red slide i don't know if this

298
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,240
is a hot take or a warning we'll we'll

299
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,920
figure out how you all feel about it but

300
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,839
when researching services vendors you're

301
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,200
going to stumble across emergent

302
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
offerings bug bounties and automated pen

303
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,920
tests or red teaming are super trendy

304
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,399
right now there's a lot of marketing

305
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,640
i don't want to digress too much but

306
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,320
there are false comparisons out there

307
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,800
between these services and a traditional

308
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,519
you know consultant-led engagement um

309
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,640
and i just don't think they're a

310
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
one-to-one drop-in replacement and i

311
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,200
think that uh folks who are buying their

312
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,959
first pen test now can get you know

313
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,800
taken down a rabbit hole of other

314
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,079
services

315
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,920
to put it another way or as one

316
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,760
respondent put it it's gang tough to

317
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,040
find something that's not just a dressed

318
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,360
up nessa scan this has always been a

319
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,959
problem it's a problem with legacy

320
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,800
vendors but it's especially a problem

321
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,320
when you're looking at

322
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,079
the level of automation used in some of

323
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,719
these places

324
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,040
so let's talk about the process right

325
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
how do we go from deciding we need an

326
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,120
assessment to actually buying something

327
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
delivering value for our business and

328
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
then what do we do after we've done this

329
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,640
once

330
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
i have kind of arbitrarily created this

331
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,040
11 step breakdown i want to note it is a

332
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
circle even though it doesn't look like

333
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,760
it

334
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,200
you probably don't want a one-off

335
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,800
security assessment you want some sort

336
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,720
of program of security that security

337
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,600
assessments are part of

338
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,839
and so we can start by figuring out our

339
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
motivation and this is like fairly

340
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,000
obvious to some folks but a misstep in a

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
lot of these processes

342
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,320
to book a successful engagement you have

343
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,160
to have a clear goal it's true of any

344
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,480
product management but

345
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,720
there are a wide range of reasons to you

346
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,360
know book an assessment for a report

347
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,880
yours are going to have downstream

348
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,800
considerations for how you operate the

349
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,959
assessment what vendor you procure

350
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,399
you might want to just do pure risk

351
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,920
reduction i want to know what risks are

352
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,600
out there i want to fix them

353
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,279
maybe you're trying to sell your

354
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,279
security program internally and are

355
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,120
hoping for a report that shows that

356
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,800
you're doing a great job or maybe you're

357
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
hoping for a report that highlights the

358
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,639
need for more resources

359
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,160
it's involved in the sales cycle

360
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,639
although i will say that for sales wait

361
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,560
until you have a client deal contingent

362
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,399
on an assessment before procuring one

363
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,680
for that reason

364
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,279
it will save you some time and pain

365
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,800
early on

366
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
and also post breach and this isn't

367
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
instant response this is you know after

368
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,320
a breach i want to identify how they got

369
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,240
in where they otherwise could get in

370
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,360
raise my risk baseline

371
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
and so you know

372
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,440
great to see risk reduction as the top

373
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,839
cause of folks buying a penetration test

374
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,160
uh security assessment in my mind um

375
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,560
that's the most altruistic reason to

376
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,480
just holistically improve your program

377
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,839
but you'll also see a lot of folks are

378
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,760
buying them for compliance or internal

379
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,120
evidence and this is interesting because

380
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
you probably want a different test for

381
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,639
each of these reasons and we'll talk

382
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,160
about that in a bit

383
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,839
but you know you've decided you want a

384
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,760
test for risk reduction or for your you

385
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,360
know pci

386
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,639
compliance

387
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,440
um any go about finding vendors this is

388
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,519
like the first question right like

389
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,680
what is the list of vendors what are the

390
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,079
good ones how do i find them

391
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,920
it's surprisingly difficult you can't

392
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,440
just like type it into google and trust

393
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,000
you'll get a good deal uh you can't tell

394
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,680
the wheat from the chaff

395
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,079
um and there's a lot of marketing out

396
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,040
there trying to uh muddy the waters

397
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,560
and so i was gonna give you a taxonomy

398
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,399
of like the types of vendors but i don't

399
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,000
have five thousand dollars to spend on

400
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,040
this talk

401
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,480
so we're just gonna give you the types

402
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,639
of vendors minus the taxonomy so um

403
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,160
there's a broad marketplace there's

404
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,839
misleading sales tactics there's

405
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,000
evolving terminology and an overwhelming

406
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,320
array of vendors and services but

407
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,000
navigating this as a buyer it helps to

408
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,160
try and like bucket the vendors you're

409
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,519
seeing um into common patterns and you

410
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,279
can take this and your goals and then

411
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,800
really start to narrow down the possible

412
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,360
vendors for your contracts so there's a

413
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
big range here from multinationals to

414
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,440
solo shops you have single service

415
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,880
specialists as well as you know low-cost

416
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,800
vendors that are competing on price they

417
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,639
have their place and then mssps and vars

418
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,560
and on the last two i just want to say

419
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,240
it's a high trust relationship to have a

420
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,160
managed security service provider or a

421
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,199
var

422
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,800
however if you're buying a security

423
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
assessment in order to validate the risk

424
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,720
reduction they are providing think about

425
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,880
what it means to book the pen tester

426
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
security assessment through that partner

427
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
you may want external validation in that

428
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,120
case

429
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,320
and so

430
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
here's the first set of challenges we

431
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,079
got from survey respondents

432
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,600
finding good vendors who provide

433
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,279
significant value who are available when

434
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,120
you need them who have expertise in your

435
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,839
specific subsystem and who can provide

436
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,560
consistent quality staff it's

437
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,040
true throughout the industry that um you

438
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,880
can definitely find a vendor but finding

439
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,399
one that meets your needs is still hard

440
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,920
and so there are a lot of strategies you

441
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
can do to find them

442
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,360
this image is associated with

443
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,880
certifications in case anyone was

444
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
wondering

445
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,240
so you can start with network

446
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,079
recommendations this is the first thing

447
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,839
you'll hear generally right like talk to

448
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,279
your network find a friend who's gotten

449
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,040
an assessment ask them who their vendor

450
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,079
was

451
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,560
when doing so keep in mind that like it

452
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,320
depends on the quality of your network

453
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,920
and their ability to vet whether they

454
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,160
got a quality assessment a lot of folks

455
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,639
will get referrals from people who

456
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,680
may not

457
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,199
have broad experience with different

458
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,519
vendors and have no way of you know

459
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,839
saying how good it was or not

460
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,000
or folks who haven't been a client at

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,360
all and are recommending a friend who

462
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,800
they trust which

463
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,680
has a little less diligence to it

464
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,279
i also just kind of

465
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,519
like this follow the leader play in

466
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,680
finding vendors which is a lot of

467
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,519
marketplaces and integrations for big

468
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,399
tech companies require an assessment to

469
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,959
get into the marketplace to integrate

470
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,079
google's oauth stuff has this facebook

471
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,399
workplace has it

472
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,399
and they generally name a few vendors

473
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,240
they trust to do these assessments and

474
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,920
that can be a good way to kind of get a

475
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,639
picture of what big tech is using that

476
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,160
being said your needs are probably not

477
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,000
the same of those of like facebook or

478
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
google and keep that in mind as well

479
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
depending on your budget um

480
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,920
but there are a lot of ways to do this

481
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,639
research quick call out

482
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,320
great to go up to conference speakers if

483
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,839
they work at security consultancies and

484
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,600
hire them as someone who used to do that

485
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,920
and work at a security consultancy but

486
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,759
watch out for pay-to-play schemes watch

487
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,759
out for sponsored sessions

488
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,480
um this is the stack rank of like what

489
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,399
other people are using to find their

490
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,440
vendors

491
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,000
um i would call out that i'm a bit

492
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,560
surprised by research being so high

493
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
research is very cool it contributes a

494
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,880
lot to the industry it's not very

495
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,800
tightly correlated to like real world

496
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,040
assessment competencies and so like

497
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,720
going to a conference talk and having a

498
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,320
researcher say like

499
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,240
a war story about a cool exploit they

500
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,639
found and then hiring their company as

501
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,959
your pen tester is not one to one to me

502
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,319
so i'd argue a little caution there

503
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,760
and i'm surprised by the low view of

504
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,439
analyst rankings although not offended

505
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,760
by it uh they get a lot of attention

506
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,679
especially on twitter a lot of effort

507
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,559
paid and apparently we're all

508
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,079
in this cohort at least in some

509
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,760
consensus that's not how we prefer to

510
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,400
make our decisions

511
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,039
so we've defined motivation let's get

512
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,119
more granular on what you need

513
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,120
and what sort of like constraints you

514
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,600
have on the vendor you can choose

515
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
and so scoping is during a security

516
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
assessment it's like here's what work

517
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,039
we're intending to get done um and like

518
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,799
let's put some boundaries on it so that

519
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,720
our vendor is not just wandering in the

520
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,240
woods

521
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,400
and it falls under parkinson's law um

522
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,919
this is the law that states that like

523
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,240
work expands to fill the time allotted

524
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
um you scope a project because you're

525
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,559
trying to give them just enough time to

526
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,039
give like pareto principle 20 of the

527
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,559
time 80 percent of the outcomes high

528
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,480
return on value

529
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,799
if you ask a vendor how long something

530
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,799
will take without giving them a tight

531
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,520
scope you can expect them to try and

532
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,039
take as much time as you can for it

533
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,960
and it's all about balance right when

534
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,480
you're scoping an assessment whether

535
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
this be a web app or a network you're

536
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
trying to do a comprehensive set of

537
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,320
tests

538
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,080
but a focus on the greatest risk because

539
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,120
you're not going to pay for an

540
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,640
assessment that covers everything

541
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
everywhere all the time

542
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,679
so you have to be thoughtful about where

543
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,320
you pick your battles

544
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
and does the client you get ahead by

545
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,400
coming into procurement um you know

546
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,640
something like half of clients are

547
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,880
coming in with a clear scope in mind and

548
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
this will really help you groom your

549
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,960
engagement to provide the most value to

550
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,360
your organization

551
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,880
there are a lot of things that you

552
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
should think about when you're scoping

553
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,880
like budget is the first and biggest

554
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,039
constraint here you can see the folks

555
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,720
are saying that you know assessments are

556
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,880
a big part of their security program but

557
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,880
budget may not be totally there

558
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
and it's important because if you can't

559
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,640
afford everything you want you're going

560
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,320
to have to make difficult decisions and

561
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,639
cuts

562
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,200
so also think about the motivation and

563
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,280
how that might impact scoping if you're

564
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,039
getting a pci assessment for example

565
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,480
there's some pretty clear guidelines on

566
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,559
what you need to include um if you're

567
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,280
doing it for sales you may

568
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,559
care a lot about what sort of

569
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,080
public-facing materials you're allowed

570
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,919
to use and say

571
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,679
you may have documentation needs like

572
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,360
you need a letter of attestation to give

573
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,200
to a client or maybe even a public

574
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,880
report which is something like pretty

575
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,840
complicated and expensive to procure

576
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,200
if you have measurement goals like

577
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,640
you're trying to test your blue team

578
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,160
you're probably talking about a red or

579
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,000
purple team engagement which has all

580
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,160
sorts of different constraints scoping

581
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,400
is a huge topic of its own i'm linking

582
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,840
here to four different guides i found

583
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,120
helpful

584
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,640
marks from 2007's still holds up so like

585
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
that's the one i'd read if you read one

586
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,000
thing about uh scoping application

587
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,559
security

588
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,080
so

589
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,840
these are some dots they are hopefully

590
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,159
animated we'll see how this goes

591
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,600
awesome so

592
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,280
there are requirements you may have that

593
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,200
limit your available pool of vendors and

594
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,120
your optionality here

595
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
if you are requiring a remediation

596
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,960
assistant not all vendors will offer

597
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
that um you should know that in advance

598
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,039
so that you can kind of use your time

599
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,520
wisely similarly any requirements you

600
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,120
place on the assessor whether that be

601
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,200
requiring them to be on-site or have

602
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,440
certain citizenship or clearance or

603
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
methodologies or certifications these

604
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
all serve to limit your pool of

605
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,559
potential vendors

606
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,919
fundamentally that's not always a

607
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,679
problem it you know reduces your

608
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,000
decision space um but it can also make

609
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,760
things more expensive because you're

610
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,200
limited in your options

611
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,120
so you you know you you roughly know i

612
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,960
want to test this web app

613
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
i have a few you know tens of thousands

614
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,799
of dollars

615
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,960
i have a rough idea of a list of vendors

616
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
like let's gather some proposals and

617
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,400
start figuring out who we're going to

618
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,600
use

619
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,840
and so there's a few steps right if

620
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,600
you're a large company you probably have

621
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,919
a formal rfp process

622
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,840
smaller organizations it's normally like

623
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,240
call up a few vendors and ask

624
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,960
rarely something so formalized

625
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
generally industry analysts my

626
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,400
experience your shortlist should

627
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,480
probably be around three organizations

628
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,640
it's really time consuming to have all

629
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,520
these vendor conversations and there's

630
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,640
like

631
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,559
limited incremental benefit to adding

632
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,080
additional vendors to that pool of

633
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,280
selection

634
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,799
so cut early

635
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,559
get some high confidence in some vendors

636
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,159
through your rfp or request for

637
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,000
information or some basic scoping and

638
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,080
then really drill down into some initial

639
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,039
calls

640
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,320
and here's where we flash back to

641
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,400
motivations right like what are some of

642
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,919
the ways that your motivation may

643
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,640
influence your vendor selection

644
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
if you're looking for compliance you may

645
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,919
require vendors with certain

646
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,080
certifications you also want to have

647
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,000
what i call a balance of substance when

648
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,760
you're trying to target compliance with

649
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,679
an assessment you want them to provide

650
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,240
value you want them to do a good job you

651
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,520
also want them to help you pass

652
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,280
compliance so there's a balance there on

653
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,039
the type of vendor you choose

654
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,840
um

655
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,679
similarly like there may be auditor

656
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,679
relationships um in internal

657
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,360
attestations

658
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,200
this also may be like depending on your

659
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,960
audience you may know that a certain

660
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,799
executive has a lot of faith in a

661
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,679
certain

662
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,799
external party and you can use them

663
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,640
mmas are interesting because it ends up

664
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,400
boiling down to speed of engagement in a

665
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,320
lot of cases but they also have specific

666
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,919
characteristics you'll want to search

667
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,200
for

668
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,799
and then of course like

669
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,200
for sales like i said wait until a

670
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
client deal is contingent on an

671
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,039
assessment because clients will have

672
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,400
really strong opinions on who the

673
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,840
assessor is if they're at the scale

674
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,880
they're trying to throw their weight

675
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,559
around here and the worst thing is when

676
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,240
you've like just paid for a shiny new

677
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,080
assessment and then a client says they

678
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,360
don't care and you have to go to the big

679
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,159
four

680
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,760
it hurts

681
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,960
from a budget perspective

682
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,200
so like what do you do on this first

683
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
call i've been on a lot of these calls

684
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,960
with clients and with vendors and

685
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,200
there's no consistency to like how we

686
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,640
talk about an assessment and try and

687
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,720
figure out if the vendor's correct

688
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,840
here are some things you should think

689
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,880
about

690
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,799
from a logistics perspective like how

691
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,559
soon can you staff this engagement is a

692
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,880
really early way to call vendors

693
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,200
especially as you get into q4 calendars

694
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
get packed generally you're looking at

695
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,360
like a week or two lead time for the

696
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,760
average vendor in the average period and

697
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,320
then in q4 that balloons you're also

698
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,679
going to want to focus on experience

699
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,679
with organizations like yours and when i

700
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,360
say like yours i mean things like tech

701
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,960
stack industry vertical risk landscape

702
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
you want to hear them speak to your

703
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
industry business logic threat model and

704
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,200
needs and not just give you like a

705
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,880
you know here's a web app pen test in a

706
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
box here's a you know network security

707
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,720
assessment here's our standard threat

708
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,080
model

709
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,520
and you want to talk about engagement

710
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,960
model and this really depends on your

711
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
organization as well and how you like to

712
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,600
work

713
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,440
but how do they collaborate are they

714
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,039
willing to open a slack channel with you

715
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,559
will they communicate over email will

716
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,520
they get on calls with your pms

717
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,279
how do they staff engagements and make

718
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,600
sure that you're getting a qualified

719
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,320
assessor for your problem space what's

720
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,080
their project management methodology and

721
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,840
as you get bigger and bigger and are

722
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,520
doing more of these this plays an

723
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,520
outsized role because you want the

724
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,360
vendor to kind of self-direct as much of

725
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,200
this as possible because this is why you

726
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,799
are outsourcing

727
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,240
and you should take these opportunities

728
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
to judge vendors on their communication

729
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,159
on their responsiveness on their

730
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,919
collaboration if they can't field these

731
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,760
initial calls effectively in a way that

732
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,000
inspires confidence why would you expect

733
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,279
the assessment to be any better

734
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,919
so you've gathered proposals right you

735
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,159
have a presumptive vendor the next step

736
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,080
is actually like welcome back to scoping

737
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,640
again this time with the vendor involved

738
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,279
vendors do their own scoping process um

739
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,799
it's in sport it's important you've

740
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,159
explicitly communicated your

741
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,320
expectations because otherwise you can

742
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,159
do a lot of back and forth as vendors

743
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,200
revise

744
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,960
proposals that are just out of line with

745
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,279
what you're intending to accomplish

746
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,440
you can request multiple scoping options

747
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,039
most vendors will give you like a big

748
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,200
medium or small if you request it and

749
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,080
that gives you some flexibility and you

750
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,840
should expect that this will be broken

751
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,400
down by level of effort coverage or

752
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,240
inclusion or exclusion of certain like

753
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,760
types of assessment elements

754
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,200
deliverables

755
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,039
you're going to want this like scope to

756
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,880
give clear

757
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,200
objectives for the assessment

758
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,039
an expected level of effort which ties

759
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,200
directly to cost and what they think

760
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,640
that gets you in terms of depth of

761
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,039
coverage

762
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,919
and another little warning here um watch

763
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,600
out for vendors that are willing to like

764
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,440
write you a quote on the spot based on a

765
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,520
metric like number of ip addresses or

766
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,279
like number of apps

767
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,840
um it's insufficient to accurately scope

768
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,760
and it lends itself to false precision

769
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,919
and i consider it like a smell when this

770
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,240
is how a vendor's gonna scope for me uh

771
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,159
for example when i was on the vendor

772
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,159
side we were getting clients come to us

773
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,400
and say like i have 200 ip addresses how

774
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,640
much will an assessment cost and you say

775
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,480
well like let me run a quick nmap scan

776
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,240
let me see what's out there you find out

777
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,480
that there are 100 ip addresses inside

778
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,159
those ip addresses there are three web

779
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,679
apps and they're actually asking you to

780
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,799
scope three web app pen tests right very

781
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,400
different approaches very different

782
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,640
levels of scope or scale the difference

783
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,880
between like test a single service if

784
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,360
it's a crud app or a static website are

785
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,320
different

786
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,520
it's important to right size your

787
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
assessment over scoping and underscoping

788
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,440
both have problems over scoping you're

789
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
paying too much under scoping you're not

790
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,720
getting what you need accomplished and

791
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,760
you're not identifying risks

792
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
and there's no consistency in how

793
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,120
vendors are going to want to scope your

794
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,520
assessment but this is the basic process

795
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,679
they'll send you a questionnaire or have

796
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,720
a call

797
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,279
or ask to like scan your perimeter or

798
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,120
maybe like give them the outputs of a

799
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,200
specific tool or look at your code a

800
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,720
little bit and then they'll have a

801
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,559
conversation about you know what you're

802
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,080
trying to accomplish and how big your

803
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,679
app is and what kind of screens there

804
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,200
are or what services are running on your

805
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,480
network or

806
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
how many employees you have for uh

807
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,840
threat modeling

808
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,279
and then like maybe they'll ask for a

809
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,120
demonstration or some documentation and

810
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,559
they throw that on a blender and come

811
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,320
out with very different numbers if

812
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,840
you've ever run procurement for pen

813
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,120
tests like

814
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
pick five vendors you will get five very

815
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,960
different quotes back

816
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,799
so that is why it's helpful to come in

817
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,320
with your own preconception of what the

818
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,799
scope looks like

819
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,799
and they're giving you back a quote and

820
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,559
it can either be fixed price or time and

821
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,679
materials

822
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,559
but basically your goal as a buyer is to

823
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,880
get detailed pricing and this is so you

824
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,720
actually can compare like for like

825
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,640
apples to apples across your various

826
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,399
quotes you're receiving because if you

827
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,399
just get like a bundled price it can be

828
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,600
really hard to tell where your

829
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
flexibility is what your axes for

830
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,279
negotiation are

831
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,120
what each is offering

832
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
often they'll call out earmarked

833
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,399
discounts like here's our list price

834
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,320
we're giving you 25 because we think

835
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,360
you're great

836
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,679
um take it with a grain of salt focus on

837
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,080
the bottom line number uh

838
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,679
payment terms are super interesting with

839
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,600
smaller vendors uh this is something

840
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,520
that i as a security person didn't think

841
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,240
a lot about um but you know whether you

842
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,080
get paid 30 60

843
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,240
365 whether you get a percentage up

844
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,720
front or in full um whether you're

845
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,480
paying on milestones like for small

846
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,840
consultancies

847
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
getting the cash earlier has real

848
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,760
leverage on you know where they're

849
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,960
willing to compromise otherwise

850
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,720
and something that comes up when you're

851
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,240
like working as a security vendor is

852
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,520
people ask why the heck it's so

853
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,000
expensive uh this is a pretty old

854
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,919
reference as well but just gives you a

855
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,000
high level of like everything that goes

856
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,080
into selling security services that

857
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,480
results in the day rate uh you know

858
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
hitting the level it does

859
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,600
especially in this market hiring

860
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,840
qualified security people is expensive

861
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,640
um

862
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,120
utilization like they're not working 24

863
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,039
7 every day they're scheduling

864
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,880
constraints there's inconsistent demand

865
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,120
there's ongoing professional development

866
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,640
there's burnout prevention which we've

867
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,720
heard about already today

868
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,320
and there's like the fully loaded cost

869
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,279
of employee and overhead of

870
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:56,080
non-assessors so um i'm not defending

871
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,320
the pricing model of any specific vendor

872
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,240
because i'm not aware of them but i will

873
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,679
say that there's a lot more to it than

874
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,440
like taking the salary you pay your

875
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,880
employee and dividing it by the number

876
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,720
of hours and comparing the two

877
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,440
so

878
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,960
you get a vendor proposal you get a

879
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,760
contract great like what goes into it

880
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,640
well you might want to negotiate um

881
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,320
i personally hate negotiating with

882
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,080
vendors is not something i enjoy i know

883
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,799
people who like take to it a lot

884
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,320
there are a few axes you can do this

885
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,480
along negotiating on pure rate is

886
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,960
effectively asking for a discount right

887
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,279
you're saying well instead of two

888
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,000
thousand dollars what if i pay you 1900.

889
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,919
there's not a ton of leverage there

890
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,520
scope is often easier to work with

891
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,360
vendors on

892
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,840
generally this is either taking down the

893
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,600
level of effort saying like can i pay

894
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,440
you for a few fewer days and we'll

895
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,760
accept there'll be some gaps or it's

896
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,600
trading depth for breath like we would

897
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,559
like to cover fewer services at the same

898
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,640
depth or i'm willing to say that like

899
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,200
let's do 80 of what you're saying

900
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,440
um

901
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,279
reporting also comes into play a lot of

902
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,679
vendors charge for reporting time the

903
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,440
more types of reports deliverables you

904
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,360
want the more expensive it gets you can

905
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,720
cut some of those depending on your

906
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,679
needs

907
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,399
and if you are a big enterprise paying

908
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,840
millions of dollars a year you can

909
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,279
probably expect the price to go down a

910
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,039
little bit

911
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,320
but you have to remember project

912
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,840
management triad for those that don't

913
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,000
know good fast cheap i think normally

914
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
it's pick two in security sometimes it's

915
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,399
like pick one um

916
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,000
if you're trying to be more flexible on

917
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,080
timeline you can save on cost and

918
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,840
quality by like cherry picking a vendor

919
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,520
that's willing to work with you

920
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,640
on the other hand if you're trying to

921
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,559
book in q4 like we talked about before

922
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,080
it's tenuous or expensive to get on

923
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,000
calendars and while there are certainly

924
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,559
varying prices uh if you're getting a

925
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,480
quote that is abnormally cheap be a

926
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,120
little skeptical please

927
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,399
and this is the same thing that we're

928
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,000
hearing about challenges from people in

929
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,159
the survey balancing quality price and

930
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,720
availability justifying spend or even

931
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,240
affording it all is really hard in

932
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
security services

933
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,200
and

934
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,159
like

935
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,480
vetting the proposals also takes a lot

936
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,720
of work because you're going to want to

937
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,320
think about

938
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,080
comparing multiple proposals like for

939
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,559
like is the quality similar is the level

940
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,919
of effort similar what are the

941
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,600
qualifications

942
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,039
ideally you're performing reference

943
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,039
checks on your vendors

944
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,200
if you are a large enough deal you can

945
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,799
request that the vendor put you in touch

946
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,559
with a client of theirs and they might

947
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,480
do it you also probably want to pump

948
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,919
your network for anyone who has an

949
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,919
existing relationship

950
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,519
a lot of people will tell you that the

951
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,279
consultant matters more than the firm

952
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,799
and this is true

953
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,399
but unless you're working with a really

954
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,559
boutique or solo shop

955
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,000
you're going to have a hard time

956
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,960
requesting specific consultants

957
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
so just to warn you a lot of time like

958
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,360
first-time assessment buyers really want

959
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,440
to review bios pick a specific

960
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,880
consultant someone they've seen at a

961
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,159
conference

962
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,320
for a variety of like valid and less

963
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,960
valid reasons big firms are going to

964
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,039
probably not play ball unless you are a

965
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,559
massive client in which case you can

966
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,080
often get a little more specific there

967
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,000
you can also review example reports see

968
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,519
if they have public-facing reports

969
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,720
really try and get an idea of the

970
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,320
quality of their work

971
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,640
and then do a bunch of paperwork so i

972
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,080
don't want to dive too much into these

973
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,399
but i will just say that there is a lot

974
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,000
of paperwork involved in security

975
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,440
assessments hopefully it is not your

976
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,640
problem but someone else at your

977
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,720
company's

978
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,960
nda's msas sows

979
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,320
you're going to see requirements around

980
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,440
insurance you're going to see liability

981
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,960
and

982
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,399
there's a lot of resources out there

983
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,320
cure53 is a consultancy that's made

984
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,159
their contracts public

985
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,000
secureworks has their msa there are a

986
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,600
lot of options here

987
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,880
for

988
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,720
cutting down on this

989
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,679
so

990
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,039
how do you prepare and deliver your

991
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,320
assessment right like you've picked a

992
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,480
vendor they're starting in two weeks

993
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
um a lot of logistics tips from the

994
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,320
surveys right it's gonna take more than

995
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,840
you expect you're gonna need technical

996
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,519
people on call you're going to want

997
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,200
clear lines of communication and you're

998
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,320
going to want to use business

999
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
initiatives to

1000
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,240
potentially fund the pen test right like

1001
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,960
these are small disconnected tips

1002
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,799
here's how i break it down there's kind

1003
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,880
of three horizons you're working on

1004
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,559
internal alignment which means getting

1005
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,320
authorization and buy-in from all the

1006
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,919
right people that this assessment is

1007
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,600
going to happen and they will be ready

1008
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,519
to deal with the results

1009
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,200
as well as in some cases blue team

1010
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,120
collaboration if you are running a red

1011
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,200
team assessment have a very clear plan

1012
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,799
of how your blue team will become aware

1013
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,360
of it if they need to

1014
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,200
communication channels are important how

1015
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,880
are you going to internally track

1016
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,960
progress who's responsible for first

1017
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,039
applying to vendor questions how are you

1018
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,559
going to dispatch vulnerabilities

1019
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,640
internally and what's your escalation

1020
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
policy is there a level of risk where

1021
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,240
you'll want it reported immediately and

1022
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,519
what are you going to do if like a

1023
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,159
critical comes in off this assessment

1024
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,159
and then this is fairly uncommon but i

1025
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,080
really advocate for people considering

1026
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,919
sharing their known risks with vendors

1027
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,679
if you're getting an assessment share

1028
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,600
your previous reports share your threat

1029
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,840
models share your risk assessments this

1030
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
transparency is uncommon but lets them

1031
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,360
hit the ground running and build on

1032
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,440
prior art you've already done so you're

1033
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,360
not starting from scratch each time and

1034
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,120
that really speaks directly to your most

1035
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,159
business critical risks

1036
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,399
there's also technical preparation the

1037
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,719
first one feels obvious but like think

1038
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,480
about resolving anything outstanding

1039
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,159
before commissioning an assessment if at

1040
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,639
all possible the worst thing is when you

1041
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,760
as a client buy an assessment and then

1042
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,440
are paying them to tell you a bunch of

1043
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,480
open findings you already know about

1044
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,079
there's also a lot to do with the test

1045
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,079
environment assuming you're testing in a

1046
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,320
test environment setting up integrations

1047
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,960
configuration feature flags roles

1048
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,040
seating data some of these are more

1049
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,280
common than others but when i was

1050
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,719
working as a consultant the number of

1051
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,480
times i walked into a company and they

1052
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,679
gave me like

1053
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,320
an empty b2b sas app with nothing set up

1054
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,239
and i spent my first three to five days

1055
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,359
just like typing in data entry um it's

1056
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,960
fine as a consultant if that's where you

1057
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,639
want to spend your day rates go for it

1058
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,480
but really think about whether the

1059
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,079
environment's sufficient for them to

1060
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,400
express all your functionality same with

1061
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,560
like network environments um is

1062
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
everything actually like ready to be

1063
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,920
tested configured in a prod similar way

1064
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,680
you may need to change freeze if this is

1065
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,599
a like production environment something

1066
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,960
to think about

1067
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,560
reporting vulnerabilities and then

1068
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,839
having to like trace them through

1069
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,680
various versions of applications to see

1070
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,440
if they exist or not because of moving

1071
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,520
environments is never fun

1072
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,280
and consider disabling out of scope

1073
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,000
controls this is sometimes controversial

1074
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,560
with clients but if you have a waf if

1075
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,000
you have ip allow listing if you have

1076
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,400
risk-based authentication unless you are

1077
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,480
intending to get an assessment to test

1078
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,880
the efficacy of those controls

1079
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,400
just turn them off

1080
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,920
you probably don't want to pay a

1081
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,680
consultant to test cloudflare like

1082
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,440
cloudflare does that

1083
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,599
so it's better for everyone to just like

1084
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,400
let them focus on your actual scope and

1085
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,040
your controls

1086
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,640
and just to call out that like folks

1087
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,720
forget about onboarding depending on the

1088
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,240
size of your company this may involve

1089
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,680
like putting a ticket in jira for

1090
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,599
another team to manage it but there's

1091
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,520
hardware there's software there's demos

1092
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,760
and documentation you may need hr

1093
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,160
paperwork legal paperwork you may need

1094
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,320
to warn it if they're coming on site

1095
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,599
there's all sorts of badging and

1096
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,880
security

1097
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,960
get this done early so that again you

1098
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,440
are not paying your vendor to sit around

1099
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,240
and wait for their stuff to get set up

1100
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,000
and disappointing for some of you i'm

1101
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,599
sure but i'm actually not going to talk

1102
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,040
about the assessment at all there's a

1103
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,800
lot of great resources out there on like

1104
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,880
how to do a security assessment there

1105
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,440
are a lot of kinds of assessment um i'm

1106
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,280
focusing on the scaffolding around it so

1107
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,520
you know voila your vendor comes in they

1108
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,520
perform their assessment and you're on

1109
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,680
to the readout off to the races

1110
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,720
so

1111
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,680
right the report is the key deliverable

1112
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,640
for most security assessments um almost

1113
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,560
everyone based on the survey like does a

1114
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,800
pdf report and a presentation that's

1115
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,880
what's involved

1116
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,800
the report the thing to note about this

1117
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,640
like breakdown is that reports are

1118
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,480
designed to be decomposed like if you

1119
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,119
receive a pdf report you can split it up

1120
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,480
into sections and send those to

1121
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,960
different audiences internally um

1122
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
executive summary is named that because

1123
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,800
you probably want to field it to like

1124
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,880
higher level executives well finding

1125
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,000
summaries

1126
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,680
are really useful for your security

1127
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,920
leadership to have a meta level and then

1128
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,119
of course you can break out like

1129
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,800
individual findings for line level

1130
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,599
engineers and a fun fact for me which i

1131
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,240
disagree with but there you go is that

1132
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
according the survey clients prefer an

1133
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,000
overall risk rating in their report so

1134
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,839
if you are a vendor your clients would

1135
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,359
like you to tell them if they're doing

1136
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,160
like

1137
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,040
you know

1138
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,599
good bad or mediocre across the board in

1139
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,320
your reports

1140
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,920
and then like after the assessment

1141
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,640
you're going to want to do a

1142
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,560
retrospective

1143
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,640
with the vendor this is where like in

1144
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,240
the readout you can take advantage and

1145
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,920
get additional value by asking where

1146
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,839
they'd look next what they'd recommend

1147
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,760
you do differently what trends they

1148
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,920
observed systemic mitigations they might

1149
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,040
recommend

1150
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,560
areas that were well hardened get some

1151
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,640
positive feedback

1152
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,200
but especially like how do i compare to

1153
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,520
other assessments you've done this year

1154
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,200
or industry benchmarks or your

1155
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,040
expectations

1156
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,280
a massive benefit is that like

1157
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,359
security services vendors are one of the

1158
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,640
best ways for you to get aggregate data

1159
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,480
across the industry on security program

1160
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,680
health and performance

1161
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,440
and please make sure your vendor cleans

1162
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,880
up after themselves i'm just going to

1163
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,560
point you to this excellent talk from

1164
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,240
wesley mcgrew

1165
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,000
which goes into all the various ways

1166
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,760
that a security assessment can make your

1167
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,880
environment more vulnerable not less

1168
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,200
as a consultant more than once on a

1169
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,520
security assessment i like stumbled upon

1170
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,200
findings wrote them up reported it and

1171
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,359
it turns out that my shell i picked up

1172
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,520
or escalated access was just left behind

1173
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,920
by a previous vendor in prod

1174
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,720
never a good look

1175
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,480
and this was fun task vendors is like

1176
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,000
what happens if you have no findings

1177
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
like i said earlier no findings does not

1178
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,280
necessarily

1179
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,960
read as all clients to a successful

1180
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,320
engagement like they're paying you to

1181
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,920
write up risks

1182
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,079
so vendors do three kind of buckets of

1183
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,200
things

1184
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
they manage client expectations note

1185
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,760
limitations communicate early and often

1186
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
they might write up a really detailed

1187
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,640
test plan um and try and like do quality

1188
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,760
control sandy check the results

1189
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,160
or they can also talk about like other

1190
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,560
value add defense in depth additional

1191
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,000
measures you're at a really high level

1192
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,599
of maturity but let's talk about what's

1193
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,160
bleeding edge

1194
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,359
and then you have to ingest these

1195
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,000
results um a couple tips use your

1196
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,079
standard process retriage findings you

1197
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,000
know your environment best

1198
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,320
uh you want to do root cause analysis

1199
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
and variant analysis and this is what

1200
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,400
takes an assessment from like a one-time

1201
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,880
point in time whack-a-mole on risks to

1202
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,000
actually scaling your program um

1203
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,160
determining root cause finding variance

1204
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,400
block out some security team time to do

1205
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,800
this after the assessment so that next

1206
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,320
year you're not like getting a

1207
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,160
cross-site scripting this year two more

1208
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,760
next year three more the year after that

1209
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,400
like build in some secure defaults

1210
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,240
security assessments are generally like

1211
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,839
an expensive way to find a single

1212
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,119
vulnerability so you want to do

1213
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,960
everything you can to scale that impact

1214
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,680
and just to note on personal reporting

1215
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,560
um

1216
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,800
if you are a big enough client or many

1217
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,160
vendors do this by default you can

1218
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,319
request like a csv of findings and then

1219
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,319
you can automate piping that into your

1220
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,560
vulnerability tracking which can save

1221
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,280
someone some data entry time

1222
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,800
and when you're remediation planning

1223
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,400
just a reminder you can always choose to

1224
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,119
fix mitigator accept these risks in many

1225
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,880
cases

1226
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,480
these assessments will report things

1227
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,359
that you're going to just accept not

1228
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,640
everything needs to be fixed all the

1229
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,400
time it's all about your business's risk

1230
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,920
appetite

1231
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,440
so speeding up a little here because i'm

1232
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,000
down the last couple minutes uh

1233
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,440
please remediate your vulnerabilities

1234
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,760
job one fix vulnerabilities job two

1235
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,280
minimize transactional nature

1236
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,200
point-in-time assessment maximize your

1237
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,720
overall value

1238
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
if you have validation or re-testing as

1239
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,640
part of the contract especially if

1240
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,000
you're getting client-facing documents

1241
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
make sure to follow through on that

1242
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,079
and do a retrospective internally this

1243
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,440
is where we're talking about like how do

1244
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,200
you tell if you got a good assessment

1245
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,040
same reason procurement is hard this is

1246
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,800
hard to do you're going to want to look

1247
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,880
at like report quality how they handled

1248
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,400
false negatives and false positives

1249
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,640
it's especially insidious but you can

1250
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,280
use canary bugs if you have open risks

1251
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,960
and they don't find them you really want

1252
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
to have a conversation about like

1253
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,079
were there

1254
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,760
good reasons bad reasons what

1255
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,440
methodologies were they using why did

1256
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,200
these latent bugs not show up again in

1257
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,720
the report

1258
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,400
and think about vendor communication how

1259
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,160
did you feel about price for value did

1260
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,000
you feel prepared were you able to reach

1261
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,800
them

1262
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,839
uh did the readout answer any questions

1263
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,760
and then you have to talk about testing

1264
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,359
cadence right you're not just doing this

1265
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,560
once

1266
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,240
annual is a good starting point but

1267
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,000
other teams do it quarterly or aligned

1268
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,839
to development cycles

1269
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,920
uh continuous testing is certainly

1270
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,240
gaining momentum as this one quippy

1271
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,680
person said

1272
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,280
uh i'll give you a second because i

1273
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,680
enjoyed that

1274
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,720
and you're going to think about scope

1275
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,480
and vendor for future assessments right

1276
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,079
talk about breadth and depth did we

1277
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,920
cover a wide enough scope did we get

1278
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,720
deep enough what limitations were there

1279
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,560
do we want to retarget the same surface

1280
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,480
again to get more depth or a different

1281
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,040
surface next time and vendor rotation is

1282
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,119
divisive some people say you should

1283
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,000
switch vendors some say you shouldn't

1284
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,119
what i will say is that there is a

1285
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,040
compromise use the same vendor use

1286
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,079
different consultants at that vendor

1287
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,400
pros of rotation is like cross vendor

1288
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
comparison it works if you think firms

1289
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,319
are fungible quality

1290
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,280
cons

1291
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,599
or pros of repetition vendors will

1292
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,200
recommend this they probably have their

1293
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,359
own motives but i will say it does give

1294
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,319
you like improved continuous context

1295
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,079
and then you want to scale your program

1296
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,680
um the bigger you get the more you

1297
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,000
optimize for product management uh the

1298
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
more you want to standardize procurement

1299
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,440
the more you want to decide when to

1300
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,440
staff in-house for high value

1301
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,040
and basically select a handful of

1302
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,160
companies

1303
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,400
to make contracting easy reduce like

1304
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,160
one-off pen tests with different firms

1305
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,319
it has high overhead and think about

1306
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,480
return on investment

1307
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,920
and with that i will leave up the fact

1308
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,640
that most people don't uh i am at time

1309
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,960
so i just want to say

1310
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
think about how hard this is

1311
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,040
structure things based on motivation and

1312
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,599
use assessment to not kill bugs but to

1313
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,440
kill bug classes

1314
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,040
if you'd like to dive deeper into this

1315
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,960
it's available on tl dr sec slides are

1316
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,400
available as well and thank you all for

1317
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,790
your time

1318
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:37,710
[Applause]
