keynote uh is we need more mediocre

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,800

so a jackie of all trades master of none

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,079
jackie bowe has spent time in roles such

00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,800
as a malware analysis reverse engineer

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,960
security engineer and head of security

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,600
at places like facebook patreon and the

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,599
u.s government these days she can be

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,640
fined scale found scaling security teams

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,000
coaching and thinking about how to

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
reduce burnout and increase compensation

really excited like i was beaming under

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,920
my mask going up all of those escalators

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,360
besides was the last in person

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,280
conference that i went to and so being

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
up here is

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,440
really incredible for me

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,959
i just want us to take a second to

48
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
realize that we are here in person

49
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,599
maybe look to the person next to you if

50
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,280
it's someone you haven't met say hello

51
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,160

all the organizers

54
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,000
uh it's really hard to put on a

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,560
conference it's incredibly hard to put

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,720
on one during a pandemic

57
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,480
and i just really want to give them a

58
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,160
lot of kudos for putting this together

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,239
and getting this community together that

60
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,640
i love

61
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
and also inviting me up here to give you

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,080
some of my spicy takes

63
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,239
first who am i if you haven't met me my

64
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,080
name is jackie bowe and i've been

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,440
working in the security industry for

66
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,920
just over the past 10 years mostly as an

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
engineer in the realms of malware

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
reverse engineering and threat detection

69
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
i've definitely dabbled a lot

70
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,599
i've done cloud security product

71
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,800
security corporate security devsecops as

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,519
well as tours as the head of security

73
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,319
and leading product security and now i'm

74
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,159
directing threat detection and response

75
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,840
at asana

76
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,400
i love solving puzzles that's why i love

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
this industry i love whether they're

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
technical interpersonal or

79
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,760
organizational

80
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,640
i think of myself as endlessly curious

81
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,480
and somewhat easily bored

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,720
which is why i'm a security engineer

83
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
which is why i love this industry

84
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,640
but

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,599
okay before we go any further

86
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,080
let's talk about my talk title

87
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
so the word mediocre kind of feels like

88
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,319
i am just lightly slapping you with a

89
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,319
you know white leather glove it feels

90
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,599
like an insult just to say this word

91
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,680
why did i choose it and why did i say i

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,879
want more of this in our industry

93
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,000
well first

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
i chose it because it's spicy i chose it

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,439
because it would get you thinking it

96
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,880
would get you maybe interested to come

97
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,798
and hear me talk

98
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,720
i also chose it because our perception

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,600
of this word being so negative

100
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,080
if we look at the actual definition it's

101
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,759
of only moderate quality not very good

102
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,919
pretty benign not actually that negative

103
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,560
of a definition but our perception of it

104
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
is pretty negative and i just want you

105
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,400
to think about that as we go through

106
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,360
this talk how we can kind of change

107
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,880
what things are by how we perceive them

108
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,199
so first i want to share a story

109
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:47,919
so

110
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,199
imagine me

111
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,120
a brand new security engineer at

112
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,680
facebook i've been hired to mostly do

113
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
malware reverse engineering

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,520
to try to track actors using the

115
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,360
platform to spread malware

116
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,280
so i'm given an assignment i'm given a

117
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,520
binary and i

118
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,000
am told to find a signature that we can

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
deploy to stop this spreading on

120
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,639
platform

121
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,280
so you know pop-up ida pro looking for

122
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,400
patterns

123
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
i am going to write a signature on clam

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,360
av which is in my opinion still the best

125
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,919
open source antivirus there is

126
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,080
and i find a pattern in the binary that

127
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
i can use to uniquely key

128
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,360
write it in the hdb format film pretty

129
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
good and i push it to production

130
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,240
those of you who've been to facebook

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,000
classic campus know that there is a

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,360
place called the sweet stop it has some

133
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,000
of the best ice cream and i

134
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,880
love ice cream so of course what i do

135
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
after i push this signature is i go get

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
myself ice cream and i'm very proud of

137
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,400
myself i'm like you know there was a

138
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,160
reason they hired me there's a reason

139
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
i'm here i'm gonna make zuck proud this

140
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,080
is great

141
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
i get my ice cream cone and it's mint

142
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
chocolate chip with

143
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,080
rainbow sprinkles because i'm chaotic

144
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
and i'm walking back

145
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
feeling really good i get back to my

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
desk and i see my

147
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,520
manager who's my mentor and the person

148
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,039
who brought me out to work at facebook

149
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,720
and he's like huddled over his laptop

150
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,280
doing something and i'm like what's

151
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,639
what's going on

152
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,759
and he's like well the av tier crashed

153
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,680
and i'm like oh and he's like yeah a

154
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,360
signature was pushed

155
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
and it's it's crashing the tear

156
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,240
thing about clam av signatures if you

157
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
forget a new line at the end of the text

158
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,560
file it crashes just does not work

159
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,120
rav tier also at this time did not have

160
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,199
linters or things to check for this

161
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,000
so

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,039
effectively i stopped file uploads to

163
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,759
facebook messenger for more than an hour

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,319
but less than three

165
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,440
ice cream ruined

166
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,039
so why do i share this story

167
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,800
mostly because i think all of us have

168
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,880
stories like this some of us have

169
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,919
multiple

170
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,599
i like to tell this story to all of my

171
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,039
reports the first time they crashed

172
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,479
production

173
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,440
because the truth is we aren't perfect

174
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,599
none of us are perfect

175
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,520
and throughout my career this has just

176
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,719
popped up again and again

177
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,120
and the thing is no one is perfect this

178
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,520
is in part why we have jobs it is our

179
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,680
job security the fact that humans make

180
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,960
errors

181
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,479
i want to point out this quote from the

182
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,120
dbir report thank you dbir writers uh

183
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,160
that talks about uh the human element

184
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,919
and that the human element continues to

185
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,440
drive breaches

186
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,080
this year 82 of reaches involve this

187
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,400
human element whether it is the use of

188
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
stolen credentials fishing

189
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,080
misuse or a simple error people continue

190
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,319
to play a very large role in incident

191
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,039
and breaches alike

192
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,479
turns out

193
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,000
ironically

194
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,919
that systems built by humans are

195
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,160
susceptible and vulnerable to humans

196
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,840
themselves

197
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,960
i know i know it's wild

198
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,680
but for some reason

199
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,000
in this industry

200
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
we believe that as security

201
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,560
practitioners we need to be perfect

202
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,720
and in return we expect each other to be

203
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,680
perfect infallible amazing hackers that

204
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
always save the day and never forget to

205
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
include the new line at the end of their

206
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,879
files

207
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,360
who have never reused a password or ever

208
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,919
been a beginner at anything

209
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,919
we set unrealistic goals for ourselves

210
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,440
to know everything

211
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,519
we pretty much just expect ourselves to

212
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,560
be unicorns

213
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,760
what's more as we expect that we're

214
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,240
doing security work not just in our jobs

215
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
but we're also hacking on side projects

216
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
we're doing capture the flags we're

217
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,360
reading white papers we're keeping up

218
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
with infosec twitter which have you been

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,040
on there oh

220
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,959
and also hey going to conferences on

221
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,240
saturdays

222
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,760
yeah

223
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,279
basically we have this perception that

224
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,200
in order to be a great security engineer

225
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,839
or practitioner security has to be your

226
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,800
life

227
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
there seems to be this idea that by

228
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,640
living and breathing and only doing

229
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
security we're actually making ourselves

230
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,760
better

231
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,600
professionals and keeping the world more

232
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
secure

233
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
i have a hypothesis though

234
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,360
that our extreme expectations of

235
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,160
ourselves and each other drive burnout

236
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,640
not excellence

237
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,120
we have this idea that more is better

238
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,959
you know living breathing only doing

239
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,519
security

240
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,600
but just as noise doesn't make better

241
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
alerts in a sim

242
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
hyper fixating on perfection doesn't

243
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,480
make us invulnerable to attacks

244
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,640
more doesn't actually equal better

245
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,720
what more equals here

246
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,440
is burnout

247
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,360
okay but what is burnout really you know

248
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,959
we throw this term around a lot these

249
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,920
days

250
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,040
uh into like as of 2019

251
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
it actually has its own entry in the

252
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,959
international classification of diseases

253
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,959
icd-11.

254
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,480
so burnout is a reaction to prolonged or

255
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
chronic job stress and is characterized

256
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,720
by three main dimensions

257
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
exhaustion

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
cynicism

259
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,880
and feelings of reduced professional

260
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
ability

261
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,760
so wait cynical

262
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,839
exhausted

263
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,079
with some crushing impostor syndrome

264
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,720
maybe masquerading as ego

265
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,079
seems like we already ticked some of

266
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,560
those boxes

267
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,079
and thank you to shutterstock for this

268
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,079
content

269
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,079
so what are the effects of burnout

270
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,000
there's actually a lot of physical and

271
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,640
psychological effects including

272
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,200
all of these

273
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,399
type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease

274
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,880
headaches prolonged fatigue insomnia

275
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,519
depression

276
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,440
and i also believe that our work

277
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,399
predisposes us to burnout more so than

278
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,360
many other industries

279
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,440
has anyone here experience burnout or

280
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,959
something like it

281
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,200
raise your hands

282
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,000
nice thank you for your honesty

283
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,399
so i myself is burnt out pretty much

284
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,720
like multiple times it's actually part

285
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,880
of why i'm standing up here in front of

286
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,600
you

287
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,320
i'm an advocate for preventing burnout

288
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,640
and burnout prevention

289
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,160
because of the mental and physical toll

290
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
that i know that it takes

291
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,519
it's a big reason why i'm a manager now

292
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,399
of people

293
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,399
because i want to help others who love

294
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,000
this field and who are passionate about

295
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,320
security be able to do it for a long

296
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
time

297
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,519
so why would cyber security predispose

298
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,120
us to burnout

299
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,480
let's just kind of take a look at the

300
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,079
past couple years

301
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,200
first we have coronavirus which pushed

302
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
everyone to

303
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
pretty much do everything on the

304
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,920
internet whether it was basic human

305
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,120
connection

306
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,360
care groceries jobs

307
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,480
we saw

308
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,880
the pandemic push the adoption of

309
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,639
digital means

310
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,200
an incredible amount

311
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,760
we also had the ever fun log for j which

312
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,079
a lot of us spent quite a few hours over

313
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,560
some holidays working on and still are

314
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,639
working on now

315
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,880
we had the colonial pipeline hack which

316
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,200
caused a rush to gas pumps like a real

317
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,399
physical implication

318
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,560
we have the solarwinds supply chain

319
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,959
attack which for me

320
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,200
kind of shook me because

321
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,680
the fireeye toolset was exposed and as

322
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,000
someone who is a malware analyst

323
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,160
like growing up as a malware analyst i

324
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,680
looked to mandian and fireeye as the

325
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,160
people who knew everything and for them

326
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,639
to get their tools exposed for me who

327
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,480
considers myself pretty jaded at this

328
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,519
point i was shook

329
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,800
and then you know there's massive

330
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,320
geopolitical

331
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,200
uh

332
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,240
issues that are still increasing with

333
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,000
huge cyber powers like russia

334
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,480
so what are the effects of burnout

335
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,639
specifically on our industry the first

336
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,639
and most obvious is we just leave we

337
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,639
just stop working

338
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,720
the second which is more insidious is

339
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
we're less willing to train and connect

340
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,639
with each other we're so busy working

341
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,320
and attending that we we don't connect

342
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,360
and the last is we stay reactive we only

343
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,040
can handle what's coming up and there's

344
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,279
things coming up all the time

345
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,360
i like to call it the wheel of reactive

346
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
hell

347
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,800
this is where we end up when we're

348
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,399
underwater with alerts and pr's and open

349
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,480
rolls and new headlines and it's pulling

350
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,720
us in all different directions

351
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,320
it is the voice i hear most people

352
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,000
speaking from when they're burning out

353
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,320
i have a hypothesis again i have many

354
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,320
hypotheses

355
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,079
we are stuck in a reactive loop of

356
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,279
burnout

357
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,320
and a bit of it is of our own design

358
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,519
i want to talk about some numbers

359
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,600
we have 600 000 open rolls currently

360
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,399
and

361
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,959
from microsoft's calculations it will be

362
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,199
up to 2.5 million

363
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,920
open rolls

364
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,760
for reference the number of people

365
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,079
working in this field is just over a

366
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,240
million

367
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,959
that means our field needs to grow by

368
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,040
at least more than two-thirds to meet

369
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,440
current demand

370
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,360
we are no longer in the days of trying

371
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,040
to convince stuxnet

372
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
trying to convince people that stuck

373
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
stuxnet is a real thing which i remember

374
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,560
conversations with my parents trying to

375
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,760
explain what stuxnet was

376
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
we are in an age where cybersecurity is

377
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,440
everybody's business

378
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,320
and we're not scaling to meet that we're

379
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,040
not going to scale to meet these numbers

380
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,639
and what's more do you know who's going

381
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,959
to do these jobs

382
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,760
it's going to be us

383
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,560
our current burn rate is unsustainable

384
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,079
we're burning people out faster than

385
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,959
we're bringing people in

386
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,680
i have some ideas though

387
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,240
so what do we need to do

388
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,000
we need to dismantle this security

389
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,760
unicorn we need to challenge these

390
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,240
perceptions of who we are as security

391
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,240
practitioners and who can be a security

392
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,399
practitioner

393
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,000
so i have some ideas on how to do this

394
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,079
so how do we dismantle it

395
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,120
first

396
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,639
we have to start seeing each other as

397
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,839
allies rather than competitors

398
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,320
second we need to tackle our tendency to

399
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,880
overwork and as well glorify over

400
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,800
working

401
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,720
and finally and most importantly we need

402
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
to change our perceptions of who is

403
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,360
worth hiring

404
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,199
first let's talk about allies not

405
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,880
competitors

406
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,279
first off and pretty basically

407
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,959
we're just not that nice to each other

408
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,399
whether it is someone that's currently

409
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,399
working in this field looking to get

410
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,880
into this field our customers the

411
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,519
general public our parents we're just

412
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,720
kind of elitist standoffish we're more

413
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,160
likely to challenge each other's

414
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,079
intelligence than get down to working

415
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,079
together

416
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,079
we have this idea that as security

417
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,480
practitioners we must know everything

418
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,720
already off the bat

419
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,079
and what's more

420
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,399
we must be the only person

421
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,279
to know everything

422
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,040
there's this thing in cyber security

423
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,399
it's an affliction and it's going around

424
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,920
it may get you

425
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,480
it's this idea of scarcity this idea

426
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,399
that knowledge can only be gotten by a

427
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,560
scarce few

428
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,399
that there is some artificial ceiling to

429
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,079
the number of experts we can have in

430
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,440
this industry

431
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,360
this predetermined height that only so

432
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,680
many people can get to

433
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
and if one person gets up there another

434
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,079
person can't join them

435
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,440
this is something that i've seen out

436
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,279
play again and again especially over

437
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,720
twitter

438
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,639
where people are berating each other for

439
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,720
not knowing things for being less

440
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,880
intelligent challenging each other on

441
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,120
what they know

442
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,439
and the issue is that

443
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,280
we're not going to scale to meet the

444
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
needs

445
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,640
for cyber security

446
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,119
if we are alone in a tower

447
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,559
and i think of our a lot of our

448
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,160
anti-social behaviors come from this

449
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
idea of scarcity come from this idea

450
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,280
that we can't have too many people who

451
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,720
are experts

452
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,799
but the issue is we just can't scale

453
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,919
solo we can't keep up it's not the time

454
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,080
for towers it's not the time for

455
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,600
creating your treasure piles of

456
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,080
knowledge of opcodes and lording over

457
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,880
them

458
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,120
if we are going to scale this industry

459
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
to meet the demands of an even more

460
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
networked world we're going to need to

461
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,880
drop the elite hacker stuff

462
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,840
an interesting thing is social isolation

463
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,240
and loneliness increase increases the

464
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,720
odds of an early death by 25 to 30

465
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
percent

466
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,799
in this same uk study they compared it

467
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,360
to smoking 15 cigarettes a day

468
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,960
fun fact

469
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,200
another study found that an antidote to

470
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,760
burnout is connection

471
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,840
it's not leaning into isolation it's

472
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,720
connecting with other people

473
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,160
not responding to more bug bounty

474
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,559
reports

475
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,120
the thing is elitism doesn't make any of

476
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
us better

477
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
it is time to take all of the hacker

478
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,880
tickets that you've earned

479
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,960
at the chuck e cheese of hacker

480
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,280
and turn it in for that stuffed toy or

481
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
lava lamp at the desk greg because

482
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,959
they're not worth anything here anymore

483
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,799
also closer to home elitism is the

484
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,360
enemy of diversity

485
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,440
it's been shown when a group is in the

486
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,520
minority it actually increases

487
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,960
competition

488
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,320
and i wish i could say that this is

489
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,840
something that hasn't affected me in my

490
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,440
career

491
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,240
but women right now we're only 24

492
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,559
of the cyber security workforce which is

493
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,000
actually up from 19 in 2019

494
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,160
so holo to coronavirus for getting more

495
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,280
ladies in this industry

496
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,640
we could probably do a whole talk on

497
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
that but

498
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,280
i have firsthand experienced what it is

499
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,000
like to be one of one or two women in a

500
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,080
group of 30 to 60

501
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,320
men and feeling like we were duking it

502
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,400
out for that novelty position of female

503
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,000
engineer

504
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,559
in fact my talk title was inspired by

505
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,679
this incredible blog post by emily wenn

506
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,160
who's a software engineer titled i need

507
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,480
terrible female engineers

508
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,400
it summarizes that the competition and

509
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,880
expectations for perfection for women

510
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
who are in the minority

511
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,919
is making the field intolerable

512
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,840
so we add this on top of the already

513
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,760
crushing pressure to be a hundred

514
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,080
percent hacker all the time and we have

515
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,400
a perfect recipe for

516
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,280
everyone being the same

517
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,879
coming back to our our tower

518
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,720
and i want to go back to this ivory

519
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
tower and talk

520
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,799
about how disconnection

521
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,840
makes us not see the forest through the

522
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,600
trees and actually makes us miss pretty

523
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,520
important things

524
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,720
so

525
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,240
again i'm at facebook it's around late

526
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,960
2015

527
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,480
and one of our

528
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,760
threat intel

529
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,679
folks comes to me and she says hey

530
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,679
i think we should start looking at all

531
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,640
of these weird memes that these groups

532
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,799
that we are attributing to russian

533
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,280
actors are posting it's a lot of weird

534
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,480
like

535
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,360
controversy and like just lots of weird

536
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,520
stuff we should look at this

537
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
you know what i said to her

538
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,240
is there malware

539
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,480
she's like no no it's just posts and

540
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,600
facebook groups and they're cropping up

541
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,280
you know if it's not malware i don't

542
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,159
think it's important because i was so

543
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,080
obsessed that the only thing that

544
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
mattered was the most technical thing

545
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,400
which was reversing malware

546
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,200
the funny thing besides the fact that

547
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,640
she was talking about russian troll

548
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,159
groups right before the 2016 election

549
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,120
whoops

550
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,000
uh it's also now that all of that hard

551
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,120
one you know assembly and

552
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
malware reverse engineering skills that

553
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
i learned

554
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,360
now it's all about sas now we're all in

555
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,919
the application layer and it's all cross

556
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,679
site request forgery and i feel like a

557
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,320
dinosaur

558
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,159
so yeah let's talk about always being on

559
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,600
and

560
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
this thing where we just can't really

561
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,840
disconnect from what we do

562
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,559
and uh why can't we disconnect

563
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,600
one is we love what we do i think for a

564
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
large number of us this is also a

565
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,600
passion this is also something that we

566
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,360
are incredibly

567
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,400
uh

568
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,760
interested in

569
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,520
but also we have to keep up with

570
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,039
headlines things are changing all the

571
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,120
time but like sitting here there

572
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,919
probably was another you know confluence

573
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,679
vulnerability or something happening

574
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,600
also security sorry

575
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,480
[Laughter]

576
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
security breaches could happen at any

577
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,720
time in fact i bet there's one happening

578
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,280
right now

579
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,679
listen yesterday i took a day off and

580
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,600
i'm looking at my head of security i did

581
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,200
not take the day off i jumped into

582
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,720
incident response

583
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,360
see lest you think i am up here on my

584
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
you know cloud of a perfect work life

585
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,799
balance

586
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,960
the other thing is

587
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,200
we are rewarded for it when we catch

588
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,799
those breaches when we answer the

589
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,039
executive at 2am who has his hit twitter

590
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,240
hacked because he's using the same

591
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,760
password everywhere

592
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,400
we

593
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,200
get props for that

594
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,159
and then

595
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,919
it becomes expected

596
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,600
oh you know security engineers are

597
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
always working they're always on it's

598
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
fine you can ping them at 2am

599
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,640
it's fine they love this this is the

600
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,360
wheel of reactive hell

601
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,000
we get stuck in this because

602
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,640
there is always more work to do

603
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,360
always more work to do

604
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,679
we have to make peace with this we have

605
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,360
to accept that there will always be

606
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,799
another alert there will always be

607
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,400
another cve there will always be

608
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,280
something that's happening

609
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,880
and that glorifying overworking or

610
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,960
making it that it is the norm actually

611
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,600
hurts us all

612
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,679
it means we'll burn out faster and

613
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,159
insidiously it means that we will

614
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,919
block people out of this industry who

615
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:30,720
have

616
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,760
other things in their lives like

617
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
children

618
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
family

619
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,320
or you know lesser things like mental

620
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,600
health happiness and hobbies

621
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,559
so

622
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,600
i challenge all of you when your partner

623
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,200
or friend or parent or dog asks you when

624
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,679
you're on your laptop at 7pm

625
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,720
how much more work do you have to do

626
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,320
you say

627
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,400
you know it's okay

628
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,480
i can stop and then maybe eat dinner

629
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,679
because i know that's something i'm

630
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,240
terrible at

631
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,159
and especially for those of you early in

632
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,799
your careers i encourage you to do this

633
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,880
because these habits that you set up

634
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,720
they will stick with you for the next

635
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,200
decade

636
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,919
also

637
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,840
i believe your best work happens when

638
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,919
you have space to think

639
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,760
when you're able to get off the factory

640
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,360
floor and you're able to think about how

641
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,279
the factory works when you can start

642
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,960
applying your engineering brain to

643
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,799
thinking about automations

644
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,480
and how we can actually automate

645
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,080
ourselves out of having to do that

646
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,159
incident response out of having to

647
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,559
triage those alerts

648
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,760
you know that thing that happens when

649
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,440
you take a vacation and you come back

650
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,960
and there's that problem you are working

651
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,200
on and actually i made a vacation of

652
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,720
more than a week i don't mean that

653
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,080
vacation i was like i took half a day

654
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,600
off yeah

655
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,360
you take a vacation

656
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,440
more than a week you come back you sit

657
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,120
down and you're like

658
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,240
oh yeah duh i could just do this this

659
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,520
makes sense

660
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,600
that is the magic of slack space in your

661
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,200
brain

662
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,600
our brains are incredible and they're at

663
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,480
their most capable most creative when

664
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,320
they're given the time to rest and

665
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,200
digest and process what we're doing

666
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,880
if we're just slurping down cyber

667
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,679
security content reversing and coding

668
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,840
we're likely to be caught up in that

669
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
reactive wheel of hell

670
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,840
susceptible to picking up the next piece

671
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
of reactive work rather than knowing

672
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,120
what makes the most impact

673
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,760
i don't know who needs to hear this

674
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,120
but this is something that i wish was

675
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
said to me more often earlier in my

676
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,720
career so i'm going to say it to you now

677
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,960
you can be a great security engineer

678
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,559
and still have hobbies

679
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,760
that have nothing to do with security

680
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,240
nothing to do i'm not talking about

681
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,640
loosely adjacent things i'm talking

682
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,760
about nothing to do

683
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,799
i will share mine

684
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,200
i'm an aerial artist i hang upside down

685
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,039
i think it helps all the instant

686
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,799
response fall out of my brain

687
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,360
excuse my language um

688
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,840
i also am a devoted helicopter dog

689
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,720
parent to these two uh

690
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,240
these two muffins

691
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,320
yeah that's what i do when i'm not doing

692
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,799
security

693
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,760
i also encourage you to talk to each

694
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,440
other about what you do

695
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,760
whether you like baking bread or you

696
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,200
like hip-hop or you're a rapper or a dj

697
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,559
talk to each other about what you do

698
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,960
that isn't security

699
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,039
make it the norm that you can do other

700
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,039
things

701
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,679
and lastly my most important topic is

702
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,400
this talent gap and how we're going to

703
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,559
bridge it but actually i think there's

704
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,120
someone who's better to talk about this

705
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,600
first so i'm going to queue up

706
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,080
steven here who has a message for all of

707
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,080
us

708
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,679
how do we

709
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,159
oh no

710
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,439
av how do i make sound happen

711
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,200
can i have some support making sound

712
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,200
happen

713
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,799
hey do you want to make a difference

714
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,840
fighting bad guys and making six figures

715
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,480
well do we have the job for you i got so

716
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,480
excited

717
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,080
hey do you want to make a difference

718
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,120
fighting bad guys and making six figures

719
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,360
well do we have the job for you you

720
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,360
don't have to be iron man you can work

721
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,000
in cyber security hell yeah

722
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,840
the us government estimates a labor

723
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,720
shortage of about 400 000 people over

724
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,440
the next few years in this industry

725
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,960
here are the three simple things that

726
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,320
you need to fill these jobs one need to

727
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,679
have 10 years of related job experience

728
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,480
two

729
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,399
need to have multiple accredited

730
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,039
certifications and three most

731
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,440
importantly you gotta be a rock star

732
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,679
does this sound like you no no that

733
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,159
doesn't sound like me at all awesome

734
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,559
come on down and apply at entry level

735

737
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,480
we're waiting

738
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,840
it's time to sell drugs

739
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,840
thank you i

740
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,440
highly recommend

741
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,960
yeah give it up for steven yeah

742
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,840
[Music]

743
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,640
i highly recommend checking out his tick

744
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,880
tock as zepho says he also does stand up

745
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,559
community around the bay

746
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,880
incredibly funny person

747
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,760
so let's get back into it

748
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,960
why can't we hire

749
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,200
could it be that we're looking for

750
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,000
unicorns

751
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,360
okay i'm gonna say some things and

752
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,600
all right why can't we hire

753
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,360
we have this prerequisite that everyone

754
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,880
needs to come to us already with an

755
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,720
engineering degree in order to be

756
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,880
valuable

757
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,039
second when we actually interview people

758
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,720
we don't test for the right things

759
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,960
so

760
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,120
degrees are a privilege

761
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,520
it remains that a four-year university

762
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,440
or college is still something that while

763
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,679
it's becoming more accessible is not

764
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,279
something that is available to the wide

765
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,799
socio-economic

766
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,919
uh

767
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,640
part of our of our country and our world

768
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,320
it is still a marker of privilege to be

769
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,159
able to attend a college right after

770
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,480
school

771
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,960
we still apply this idea that we live in

772
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,520
a meritocracy and naturally those who

773
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,399
are gifted or intelligent naturally will

774
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,480
get siphoned into university or college

775
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,320
and will get that engineering degree

776
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,000
before they get to us

777
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,960
and i'm sorry but this just isn't true

778
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,399
and it keeps us kind of in this

779
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,320
heterogeneous collection that we're

780
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,240
currently in

781
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,679
i heard someone clapping you can clap

782
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,000
for me

783
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,200
i like validation all right

784
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,919
so this is from an aspen institute study

785
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:34,799
about

786
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,679
diversity in the cyber security industry

787
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,120
so it says while it's been noted that

788
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,279
academic degrees do not necessarily

789
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,520
imply a more advanced level of skill it

790
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
has typically been considered a hiring

791
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,159
prerequisite for most employees

792
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,399
so we have little evidence that getting

793
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,240
to us with a degree makes you better at

794
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,640
the job

795
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,120
but wait before we go too far

796
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,320
lest you think i am railing on the

797
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,039
education as a whole

798
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,360
i think education is invaluable i

799
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,919
consider myself a forever learner i love

800
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,399
learning new things and i think the the

801
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,679
ability to get educated and to go to

802
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,360
college and to go get certificates and

803
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,799
go to boot camps

804
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,519
is invaluable and necessary

805
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,120
i think learning the principles of

806
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,960
engineering unlocks in your brains the

807
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,080
ability

808
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,799
to automate all of this manual trash

809
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,960
that we have to do right now i believe

810
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,240
that it's the future of our industry

811
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,840
i just don't think it has to happen

812
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,640
before you get into the industry and i

813
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,039
believe that availability to education

814
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,600
should be a job benefit for any role in

815
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,820
cyber security

816
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,200
[Applause]

817
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,640
right now you're all like oh clap for

818
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,720
her she likes it

819
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,480
okay

820
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,519
um

821
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,039
but let me take a step back and talk

822
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,200
about how

823
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,360
we have this

824
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,200
area between people who don't have

825
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,600
degrees and lots of job openings and

826
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
there have been a there's been an

827
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,840
industry that has grown to fill this

828
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,399
boot camps and certificates

829
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,320
these courses which are usually very

830
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,399
expensive sometimes promise people that

831
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,919
if they go through them they will get a

832
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,240
job which is misleading at best

833
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,919
the truth is in this moment in our

834
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,080
industry we do not have any standardized

835
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,000
way to think about certificates or boot

836
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,519
camps as a sign of proficiency

837
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,919
this is a problem

838
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,279
here's another

839
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,880
quote from that aspen institute study

840
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,559
there is little evidence about whether

841
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,320
these programs have been effective in

842
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,840
closing

843
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,919
gap

844
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,120
and increasing non-traditional

845
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,399
candidates in cyber security

846
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,799
it still remains that a computer science

847
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,240
or an engineering degree is the

848
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,240
universally agreed upon prerequisite

849
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,480
and again my belief is that if we offer

850
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,799
education as a benefit not as a

851
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,399
prerequisite

852
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,760
we can start to fill that talent gap

853
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,840
all right secondly let's say you

854
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
actually get your resume into a

855
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,000
recruiter and they're looking at it

856
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,320
great you get scheduled for that on-site

857
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,360
he gets your on-site and

858
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,399
oh

859
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,039
a lot of algorithms questions

860
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,279
i mean it is just the normal cocktail

861
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,720
joke that you have with people when

862
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,159
you're like oh yeah you interviewed at

863
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,440
that fang company did you have to

864
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,360
balance a binary tree or red black

865
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,240
no

866
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,760
this is not how we should evaluate

867
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,159
people for cyber security rules in fact

868
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,440
this is someone who's a software

869
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,720
engineer and he's making fun of the

870
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,640
interview process

871
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,960
the fact is we just don't know how to

872
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,519
evaluate talent

873
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,120
and i wish i had the best answers for

874
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,640
that but i don't i think it's something

875
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,440
that we need to think about

876
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,519
but you know technical rigor

877
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,760
security is hard i'm talking about

878
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,360
hiring people with different backgrounds

879
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,840
and heaven forbid no degree or a degree

880
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,919
in an unrelated field

881
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,519
won't we fail

882
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,840
security engineering is difficult it

883
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,600
takes hard work

884
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,440
and i agree i think security is a

885
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,760
particular field that requires

886
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,800
curiosity tenacity and a lot of

887
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,960
stubbornness you have to love this you

888
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,040
have to put in the work but you should

889
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,879
be able to put in that work and get

890
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,040
return on your investment

891
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,399
but wait

892
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,040
we have 600 000 open rules we don't have

893
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,599
time to train people we're underwater

894
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,359
already

895
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,560
that's the wheel of reactive health

896
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,839
speaking people

897
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,159
what do we need to do

898
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,918
we need to leverage these boot camps

899
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,760
these trainings these conferences these

900
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,800
degree programs as expected parts of the

901
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,520
job we need to hire people who maybe

902
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,040
don't have that computer science

903
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,800
background and send them to college

904
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,320
while they're with us

905
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,560
i got my master's degree nights and

906
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,000
weekends while i was working for the

907
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,839
government in fact the government paid

908
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,960
for it in return for me working for them

909
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,640
that kind of system works

910
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,440
also we talk about this pipeline problem

911
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,119
and the pipeline problem is this idea

912
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,960
that people just aren't qualified when

913
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,040
they get to us

914
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,240
and we talk about it as if it's

915
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,599
something that will sort itself out or

916
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,000
it's not our responsibility

917
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,520
you know it's the responsibility of the

918
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,960
colleges they need to teach more

919
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,200
computer science it's responsibility of

920
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,359
the high schools it's the responsibility

921
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,960
of the middle schools the elementary

922
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,400
schools the preschools it's lego's

923
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,839
responsibility it's not ours

924
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,599
the issue is that we're all going to

925
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,359
burn out before this pipeline problem

926
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,359
fixes itself

927
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,400
it's all of our problem

928
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,480
and so lastly just want to

929
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,920
go through again what it means to

930
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,160
dismantle the unicorn

931
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,960
so first seeing each other as allies

932
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,880
everyone in this room

933
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,000
you're great you're my ally

934
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
rather than competitors we don't have to

935
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,480
quiz each other on who knows more

936
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,359
uh you know crypto algorithms or have

937
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,520
you read their most recent headline we

938
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,599
don't have to poke holes in

939
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,760
what other people tell us they do to see

940
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,599
if they actually belong to sit at the

941
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,359
table

942
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,160
we need to dismantle this glorification

943
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,040
of overwork we need to tackle it

944
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,680
and think more about how we can

945
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,320
both live lives and be security

946
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,000
practitioners

947
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,680
and we finally we need to change our

948
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,599
perception of who is worth hiring in the

949
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,839
industry

950
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,359
and so i want to leave you with a

951
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,119
challenge

952
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,960
just like in the beginning i talked

953
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,040
about that word mediocre and how

954
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,200
negative it is but just how benign the

955
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,920
definition is it's okay to be a beginner

956
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,160
it's okay to not know everything it's

957
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,800
okay to be curious

958
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,240
and i want you to challenge who you

959
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,640
think belongs in this industry

960
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,720
and i think this is the answer

961
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,640
for a more diverse and sustainable

962
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,480
industry

963
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,720
so let's lower the gates let's bring

964
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,160
more people in

965
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,000
and yeah

966
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,079
let's make this industry

967
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,720
what it can be

968
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,400
yeah we need all of you

969
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,040
and for everyone in this room who maybe

970
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,880
took a seat and looked around and was

971
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,800
like i don't see many people who look

972
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,880
like me or you know i just don't know if

973
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,480
i'm cut out for this

974
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,680
you are you definitely are and if you

975
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,760
need to be reminded

976
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,320
this is my twitter and sometimes on it

977
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,520
but

978
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,760
you can find me on other platforms and i

979
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,200
will tell you

980
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,720
you belong here

981
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,959
you're great okay thank you

982
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:55,440
[Applause]

983
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
still i'm still standing up here should

984
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,880
i just keep talking

985
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,520
who questions does anyone have questions

986
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,640
do we have time for questions

987
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,960
what are my dog's names oh yes okay so i

988
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,160
have a two and a half year old

989
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,280
pomeranian named luna who is chaos

990
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,320
incarnate and i have a almost 16 year

991
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,200
old

992
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,599
terrier mix who is ornery and

993
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,320
curmudgeonly

994
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,560
i love that that's that's the question

995
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,240
where do we oh that is such a good

996
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,839
question where do i think mentoring fits

997
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,000
into all of this i would not be where i

998
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,920
am without the mentors who believed in

999
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,480
me especially when i had no belief in

1000
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,040
myself like when i was a grad student

1001
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,520
and i was sitting at the csoc at mitre

1002
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,839
trying to decode a pcap and i just had

1003
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,280
no idea what i was doing my mentors

1004
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,650
believed in me and

1005
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:47,760
[Music]

1006
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,359
i think

1007
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,280
yeah mentorship is one of the biggest

1008
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,320
gifts you can give someone

1009
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,960
yes

1010
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,720
oh do i have advice for people who want

1011
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,680
to be better mentors just do it

1012
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,440
just try like

1013
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,920
yeah be okay with failing be okay with

1014
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,160
not knowing everything just sit with

1015
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,720
someone doing ride-alongs is incredibly

1016
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,560
valuable especially like as a blue

1017
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,920
teamer

1018
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,920
what you do is more of an art than a

1019
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,040
science so having people watch what you

1020
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,880
do and learn from you

1021
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
is mentorship in itself don't overthink

1022
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,839
it

1023
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,200
can i can i take more questions i feel

1024
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,240
like

1025
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,680
yeah okay they're nodding yeah

1026
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,560
yes

1027
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,480
rather than we will hire a security

1028
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,400
engineer we will hire somebody with a

1029
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,800
clue who will just start throwing first

1030
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,119
throwing stuff at say five people

1031
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
i love that like a cohort so the

1032
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,160
question is like what about a program

1033
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,359
where instead of just hiring one

1034
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,200
security engineer you hire five people

1035
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,040
and just kind of throw them into the the

1036
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,480
fire and

1037
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,079
yeah no i love that idea i think that is

1038
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,160
kind of like what we what we do with

1039
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,920
internships except our internship

1040
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,839
programs usually only

1041
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,359
uh accept people from software

1042
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,880
engineering backgrounds so i love the

1043
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,040
idea of like having some kind of

1044
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,319
you know little

1045
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,119
test or people can do on their own time

1046
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,200
like you know can you can you use google

1047
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,520
which is probably one of the

1048
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,640
most important things to being a

1049
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,880
security engineer if they can you know

1050
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,839
pass like a little uh

1051
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,240
like a little mini capture the flag

1052
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,839
bring them on totally i think that's

1053
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,078
great

1054
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,770
okay thank you

1055
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,949
[Applause]
