two years

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,240
um but so excited to be back in person

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,460
hope you've grabbed some breakfast and

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,800
we have uh really great coffee stations

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,180
this year so definitely take advantage

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,279
of those and be ready for a full day of

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,300
events

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,159
our theme for this year is from the

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,980
ground up we chose this theme on the

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,260
tail end of our 2020 event

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,059
um just because we were you know we saw

18
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,800
the stuff was happening and was like

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,020
okay we're probably going to have to you

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,940
know going through a big change and

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,559
think about like okay we're going to

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,480
have to to reset we're going to have to

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,239
start from scratch on a lot of things

24
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,059
um and so uh you know we picked a theme

25
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,120
that focuses on return to the basics

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,680
um specifically the security besides

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,920
core tenants of community collaboration

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,500
and education after foregoing our

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,380
standard in-person event last year with

30
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,600
a you know limited virtual one we

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,640
decided that we thought this theme of

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,200
from the ground up would be more

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,939
appropriate than ever

34
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,159
so the the event is and will always be

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,900
centered on the community and we're so

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,979
very excited to bring this community

37
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,080
back together after being apart for the

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
last two years

39
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,240
so this year is a one of rebuilding for

40
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,700
us and we ask for your patience uh as

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,259
things may not go as smoothly this year

42
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,479
as you would expect we actually had a

43
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,799
fire alarm go off this morning as well

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,420

two years to put this event on uh we've

50
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,200

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,299
mandates to deal with

52
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,340

uh including the organization organizer

137
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,979
team and we've had several of our staff

138
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,960
who have actually just flat out left the

139
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,660
sfb area as I know many of your friends

140

a result of the new normal and several

142
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,380
others have decided that you know after

143
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,539
many years of doing this that it's time

144
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,160
for them to move on as well so we need

145
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,900
some fresh perspectives to keep besides

146
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,100
SF going

00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,819
conduct it's on science it's also in

168
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:23,539
your program as well

169
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,620
so I know a lot of people right now are

170
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,300
thinking about covid as well I mean it's

171
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,860
been on our minds for the past two years

172
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,080
uh so

173
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,639

174
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,259
the last in-person conference that maybe

175
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,300
