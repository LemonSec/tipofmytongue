favorite conferences in the world so i'm

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,000
really really excited to be up here

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,320
today

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,479
and today we are going to talk about

28
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,080
building sustainable security programs

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,240
okay you may be tired of talking about

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,880
information security burnout because you

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,640
know it's a topic that we've all been

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
talking about a lot

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,159
maybe more so than we ever have before

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
especially after two years of the

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
pandemic and counting thank you everyone

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,799
for wearing your masks by the way

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,080
um and

38
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,240
in the pandemic when it's been difficult

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,799
to just be a human let alone be a human

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,439
in a job where you just never win

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,439
and of course there is no shortage of

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,439
literature on burnout in the infosec

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,280
industry and all the underlying reasons

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
that go into it

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,479
but

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,280
um today the topic i want to talk to all

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,119
of you about is

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,040
the ways in which

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,920
factors that contribute to the pressure

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,840
and stress that we feel as security

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,719
professionals and changes that security

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,719
leaders can be making

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,200
to their organizational culture to their

54
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,479
risk perspective program strategy and

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,399
alignment with their stakeholders

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,840
that would help improve the

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,360
sustainability

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,720
and well-being of their teams

59
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,360
okay so why don't we jump right in we

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
will start from talking about the

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,800
contributing factors that play into this

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,879
often in infosec we're in firefighting

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,480
mode a lot

64
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
there's always another open

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,599
vulnerability that we have to go chase

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,560
down

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,000
another feature throughout model that

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,599
needs to get done

69
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,920
another sas security review

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
another java vulnerability that has to

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,319
be patched across your whole fleet

72
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,800
we can just never catch up

73
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,480
and being in this heightened state of

74
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
stress and constantly reacting to things

75
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,599
it's exhausting

76
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,400
and when you're in this mode yes you may

77
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,959
be keeping busy all the time but you

78
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,640
aren't always being effective at

79
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,280
addressing the root cause or even making

80
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
the highest quality decisions all the

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,840
time

82
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
and as we all know security people

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
we care a lot

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
in fact sometimes we care a little bit

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
too much

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,920
and if you have spent any amount of time

87
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,640
in infosec you've been disappointed

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
you've been disappointed by the

89
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,159
decisions that were made by your

90
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,720
stakeholders you've been disappointed by

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,319
the state of things

92
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,799
the bugs that got shipped to production

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,040
the intense back and forth with a

94
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,280
product team that still led to a risk

95
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,560
exception

96
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,840
and because of all of that

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,400
disappointment we sometimes tend to give

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
up a little bit

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,239
we tend to assume the worst

100
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,360
of our partners of our customer teams of

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,080
our stakeholders of our leadership

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,519
it's almost like we've earned our

103
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,879
cynicism

104
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,920
we think oh i know how bad this thing is

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,200
if everybody else cared as much as i do

106
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,920
but of course that never happens so it's

107
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,959
so easy to become jaded by the state of

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,000
things

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,480
i definitely remember a number of times

110
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560
walking away from stakeholder meetings

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,200
and just feeling annoyed

112
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,839
and when you're in the business of

113
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,000
preventing bad outcomes and you're

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,240
constantly surrounded by all of the

115
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,800
things that can be going wrong and there

116
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,960
is a high impact of that thing going

117
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,120
wrong then it becomes easy to

118
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,520
catastrophize everything

119
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,919
we get so focused on the impact of

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,360
what's possible

121
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,280
that we forget to consider what's

122
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,800
probable

123
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,280
and it's easy to assume that the worst

124
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,759
case scenario it's bound to happen

125
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,360
it's going to happen this year it's

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,440
going to happen this week this month

127
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
there's no denying it we're just waiting

128
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,560
for the other shoe to drop

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,600
and our community is full of really

130
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,320
passionate people that truly enjoy this

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,960
field and information security we really

132
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,360
care about the work and we put a lot of

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,680
ourselves into that work

134
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,479
and for most of us this translates into

135
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,520
feeling like our job is to prevent every

136
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,759
bad thing from happening and there is

137
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,919
enormous personal responsibility that we

138
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,320
all carry around with that

139
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,479
and because there's a sense of personal

140
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,080
failure there

141
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,240
and when you couple that with the fact

142
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,080
that your customer teams or your

143
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,400
leadership don't really understand what

144
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,360
to expect from their security program

145
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,680
that is what they think right we have a

146
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,840
security team so nothing bad can ever

147
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,160
happen

148
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
i want you to take a second and think

149
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,199
about how ridiculous and impossible this

150
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,520
expectation is that we've just made our

151
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,600
normal and then we just walk around and

152
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
live our life and we're like yeah that's

153
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,280
the i'm ready to carry around that

154
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,400
pressure every single day

155
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,639
and more often than not

156
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,160
there is tension

157
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,639
and conflict between the security team

158
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,479
and your stakeholders

159
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,800
you're always convincing someone to fix

160
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,600
that bug to prioritize deprecating that

161
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,680
one legacy service that has all those

162
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,400
security holes or you're escalating risk

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,479
exceptions in product features that are

164
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,639
going out the door or you're denying

165
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,080
that sas vendor request that the

166
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,720
marketing team has to use

167
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,479
and of course there is supposed to be

168
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,479
some healthy tension there

169
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,360
but

170
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,919
being in this state of constant conflict

171
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,400
with your customers and stakeholders it

172
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,840
weighs on you it's hard

173
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
and the changing threat landscape

174
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
doesn't help either there are new

175
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,440
emerging threats all the time that may

176
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
impact your posture

177
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
what was good enough yesterday may not

178
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,639
be so today

179
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,960
maybe you weren't thinking so much about

180
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,680
ransomware a year ago or software supply

181
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,680
chain issues a couple of years ago

182
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,840
but now it's all you can talk about and

183
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,599
the vendors won't stop calling you about

184
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,599
it and now you have to go back to the

185
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,840
drawing board and figure out all of the

186
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
assumptions in your program that you

187
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,119
have to now go revisit

188
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,800
and

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,520
after all of that no matter how hard we

190
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,319
try we're never really done it's not

191
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,639
like one fine day we'll all wake up and

192
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,240
say okay

193
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
we're all good we've secured all the

194
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
things forever we can all just go home

195
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,759
no

196
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,240
we can never make progress fast enough

197
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000
and there are never enough things in the

198
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,280
wins column

199
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,199
there are always more broken things to

200
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,000
fix

201
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
in fact there isn't that much we can

202
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,960
point to as oh i did the thing that's

203
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,280
the win right

204
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,440
only one thing has to go wrong to result

205
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,319
in a bad outcome

206
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,960
okay so i just want to acknowledge that

207
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,479
that was a lot

208
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,680
and that is the reality of our community

209
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,360
and our profession today

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
i have personally struggled with a lot

211
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,440
of these things and i know folks in my

212
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,680
community that have in fact when i was

213
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,120
doing a dry run of this talk with my

214
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,479
team they're like this is too depressing

215
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,680
i was like this is our lives

216
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,199
but the good news is that we do have the

217
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,840
ability to change this status quo

218
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,240
so why don't we talk about that

219
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
the first thing that i really want us to

220
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,599
focus on

221
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,160
is how the culture of our security

222
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
organization

223
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,759
impacts the sustainability of our teams

224
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,399
we talked about how easy it can be to

225
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,719
become jaded and be cynical about the

226
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,000
state of things

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,080
but the problem with this individual

228
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,039
cynicism is that before you know it that

229
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,679
becomes the culture of your team

230
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,399
and

231
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,720
that can be really really harmful in

232
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
your ability to show up for your

233
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,560
customers

234
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,519
because you can't be objective about the

235
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,200
perspective that they're bringing to the

236
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,240
table

237
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,000
you don't trust their intentions you

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
don't trust their judgment

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,240
and you can't show up as a collaborative

240
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,120
partner because you assume the worst

241
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,839
so

242
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,959
as leaders it is our job to actively

243
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,440
disrupt this kind of mindset on our

244
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,560
teams

245
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,959
so the next time someone on your team is

246
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,839
frustrated because some team is not

247
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,000
fixing a security issue

248
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,839
help them contextualize the security

249
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,760
work in the broader context of the

250
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,399
business goals it's entirely possible

251
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,160
that the security work is not the most

252
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,839
important thing that needs to happen for

253
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,480
a particular launch

254
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,120
guide them to find the ways in which

255
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
there is commonality between the

256
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,560
security team's goals and the business

257
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,080
goals

258
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,279
help them

259
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,760
to understand the customer team's intent

260
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,920
and work towards a compromise that may

261
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,600
still mitigate the risk that you're

262
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,519
worried about

263
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,480
and the other way in which we as leaders

264
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,120
impact the culture of our organizations

265
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
is through hiring

266
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,880
so when it comes to hiring for your

267
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,680
teams you need to be thinking about

268
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,839
skills like customer enablement

269
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,880
collaboration stakeholder management

270
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,800
as much as you think about technical

271
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,440
competencies for a particular role maybe

272
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,959
more so

273
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,680
because these skills are really really

274
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,560
important in working collaboratively to

275
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
solve problems with our stakeholders and

276
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,079
to build a healthy team culture

277
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,560
and this jaded mindset of like oh man

278
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,720
everything's broken or developers they

279
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
just don't care about security that

280
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
should be a red flag we need to be

281
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
paying attention to these types of

282
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,720
things when we are building out our

283
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,519
organizations

284
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,560
i came across this comic in a blog post

285
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,120
that ryan nakomoto wrote about heroic's

286
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,640
culture

287
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,360
now

288
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,320
of course the idea of the person that

289
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,279
saves the day it's really appealing who

290
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
doesn't want to be a superhero i would

291
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,640
much prefer to be wonder woman but the

292
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,040
fact that you need heroics to save the

293
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,000
day

294
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,079
means that you failed earlier on

295
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,279
somewhere

296
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,399
and the problem with the heroics is that

297
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,120
it's not sustainable it's exhausting if

298
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,720
you have to put on that cape constantly

299
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,200
i'm not saying that incident response

300
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,600
and firefighting is not important

301
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,959
but what's also important is making the

302
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,600
proactive long-term investments that

303
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,480
would reduce the need for as much

304
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,399
incident response it would focus on

305
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,800
scalability sustainability

306
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,680
and

307
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,320
it's no surprise that you incentivize

308
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,560
more of the behavior that you reward on

309
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,959
your teams and of course when somebody

310
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,640
goes above and beyond you want to

311
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,560
recognize their efforts

312
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,160
the hard work and the impact that

313
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,360
they're having

314
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,839
but we also need to get better at

315
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,200
digging deeper and understanding why

316
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,680
that is heroics going on on your teams

317
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,160
can you understand the root causes that

318
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,959
are

319
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,120
at play here that make the heroics

320
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,279
necessary and can you solve for that

321
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,680
instead

322
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,360
as an example

323
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
if you run any java in your ecosystem

324
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
you probably remember your log4j

325
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,519
response from a few months ago

326
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,680
i know i do um

327
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,519
and my team

328
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,360
you know for that response we made

329
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,839
stickers then swag for everyone that

330
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,000
participated because you know we like to

331
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,839
do stickers and swag

332
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,000
but it was great it was good to

333
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,040
recognize all of the hard work that went

334
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,639
into that but

335
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,959
at the same time when we were conducting

336
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,560
our retros

337
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,279
we also focused on the success of the

338
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,440
long-term investments that made that

339
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,839
response possible and efficient so

340
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,480
things like ecosystem visibility things

341
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,880
like our well management tooling all of

342
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,440
these things are important for us to be

343
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,120
able to do incident response efficiently

344
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,839
and as part of those retros we also try

345
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,800
to identify areas where there may be a

346
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,000
single point of failure or areas where

347
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,079
we needed more run books or better

348
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,560
ownership because those are the things

349
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,839
that will enable our long-term success

350
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,639
so

351
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,279
when you conduct incident retros

352
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,760
make room for understanding the factors

353
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,320
that impact the sustainability

354
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,000
recognize the painstaking long-term work

355
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,160
that creates an impact

356
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,079
celebrate the work that prevents the

357
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,160
need for heroics all together

358
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,199
culture it takes intentionality it

359
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,720
doesn't just happen

360
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
so setting this tone for sustainability

361
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,079
and long-term thinking will foster a

362
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,079
culture on your team that values it

363
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,720
so this idea of additive teams really

364
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,120
resonates for me and i wanted to share

365
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,519
it with you all

366
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,480
it focuses on the need to assess your

367
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,440
current strengths and gaps as a team to

368
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,800
determine

369
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,959
what you need to be hiring for so you

370
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,040
can add to your existing perspectives

371
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,560
and skill sets

372
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,199
so think about the competencies that

373
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,120
your team currently has

374
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,040
the feedback that you receive from your

375
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
partners and customers

376
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,120
the opportunities that you aren't quite

377
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,040
able to realize yet

378
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,160
and map that into the needs for the next

379
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,000
person that you need to hire on your

380
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,120
team

381
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,279
maybe you have a lot of technical

382
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,680
security competencies on your team

383
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,480
but

384
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,959
you aren't able to improve the product

385
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,120
experience of the

386
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
ex the products that you're building for

387
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,399
your customers

388
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,720
or maybe you're missing program

389
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,360
management skills to take things to 100

390
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,160
and actually realize the risk reduction

391
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,839
impact

392
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,639
or maybe you have folks who can

393
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,880
help assess the severity of a

394
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,199
vulnerability but maybe you're missing

395
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,279
the engineering chops for

396
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,360
being able to do things like automated

397
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
pull requests that would

398
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,760
make the remediation process even easier

399
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,839
for

400
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,720
this introspection about your strengths

401
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,440
and gaps can really help build team

402
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,639
trust increase self-awareness and help

403
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,600
folks be more thoughtful about okay what

404
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,440
are we missing and really help them

405
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
appreciate the skills that they need on

406
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
their teams

407
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,959
as an example at one point

408
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,079
my team was largely absec experts and

409
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,680
they were all really great at what they

410
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,600
did you know finding vulnerabilities

411
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,839
security architecture all of that good

412
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,800
stuff

413
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
but we were not going to scale our

414
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,000
program with just abstract focused work

415
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,720
so we grew our team to bring product

416
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,800
focused security ics

417
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,279
to bring program managers software

418
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,360
engineers infrastructure security

419
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,160
engineers because we needed all of those

420
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,800
things to achieve our long-term mission

421
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,880
of being able to build a scalable

422
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,000
application security program

423
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,320
and thinking about team composition in

424
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,800
this way can create an environment in

425
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
which folks can bring that new

426
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,639
perspective to the table

427
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,040
and they can be really deeply energized

428
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
by the outcomes they're able to achieve

429
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,120
with each other and what they can learn

430
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,880
from each other

431
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
and it also reduces the commiseration

432
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,560
and pessimism of the battle scars that

433
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,440
all of your security people may share

434
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,120
and trust me i think your security

435
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,759
people could use the optimism

436
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,560
and it gives you the opportunity to

437
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,160
bring new ideas that can help solve some

438
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
of these age-old problems that we may

439
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
have given up on a little bit and we

440
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,839
need new ways to think about them

441
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,639
when it comes to building an empathetic

442
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,079
team culture

443
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,000
team leaders are the ones who really

444
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,079
need to take initiative

445
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,079
you set the tone for what that looks

446
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,760
like on your team

447
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,480
you sit in a position of privilege where

448
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
showing up with vulnerability may be

449
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,559
easier for you than most folks on your

450
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,640
team

451
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,720
but this vulnerability can be really

452
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,280
powerful for your team culture and it

453
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
can lead to really meaningful

454
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,359
connections

455
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,319
this job as we all know it can sometimes

456
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,640
take an emotional toll on you

457
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
and having an environment of

458
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,799
vulnerability and honesty

459
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,400
can really help folks feel less alone

460
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,960
it allows folks to find community with

461
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,240
their peers

462
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
and it's beyond simply being able to

463
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
collaborate on the work that they're

464
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,360
doing

465
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,960
it's about being able to build

466
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,600
connections have the support structures

467
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,520
in place that would allow you to

468
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
navigate difficult topics and

469
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,000
relationships with customers and even

470
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
help each other recognize and celebrate

471
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,720
the wins

472
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,600
a few months ago one of my teams decided

473
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,840
to spin up a forum

474
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,400
to really discuss how they work because

475
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,720
they wanted to learn from the techniques

476
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,480
that each of them are applying to kind

477
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,720
of like their own area of work

478
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,720
and sure they got to do that in that

479
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,240
forum but

480
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,320
it also ended up being a really

481
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,799
supportive space for them to share their

482
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,679
challenges and to support each other

483
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,080
because they had built that trust and

484
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,840
that environment of empathy and

485
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,600
vulnerability and they were able to

486
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,640
feel seen and heard with their peers

487
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,880
and do their best work

488
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,679
and such environments can also help us

489
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,000
get through those difficult days when

490
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,200
you just can't seem to win

491
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,400
the criticality of the security work

492
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,200
that you do it may vary based on the

493
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,520
business that you're in for example

494
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,280
human safety will always be more

495
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,799
important than say credit card

496
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,240
information

497
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,880
but no matter what your business is

498
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,440
one thing that's mostly true is that

499
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,000
security teams exist to enable the

500
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,039
business

501
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,000
now of course our job is to manage the

502
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,679
risk for the company

503
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,840
but at the end of the day if the company

504
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,440
was to go out of business then we

505
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,480
wouldn't need to be here

506
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,880
it's really important for security teams

507
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,360
to internalize this mindset

508
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,000
of business enablement

509
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,880
because

510
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
this helps us think of ourselves as a

511
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,840
department that's invested in the

512
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
success of the stakeholders that we're

513
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,960
supporting

514
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,799
we're not here to do our own security

515
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,120
thing in a corner

516
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,520
and we are here to be a part of the

517
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,919
success of the business that we support

518
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,840
and it doesn't have to be so isolating

519
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,799
in fact i would urge you to go one step

520
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,880
further and think about

521
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,280
what would it mean for you to be a

522
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,720
customer-focused security team

523
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,280
can you provide services and products

524
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,200
that your stakeholders are truly

525
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,520
delighted by

526
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,080
and i'm not saying that we have to stop

527
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
advocating for the right things for

528
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,159
security and then we just give up all

529
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,760
our influence and we just do what the

530
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,159
product managers say no that's not what

531
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,400
i'm saying what i'm saying is

532
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,720
we really think about those security

533
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,520
outcomes with influence and building a

534
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,600
track record of a security team that

535
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,360
people truly enjoy working with

536
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,360
in that world

537
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,840
i think it also makes you think more

538
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,159
about what are the security experiences

539
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,559
that aren't as usable that people

540
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,720
are trying to avoid and you can focus

541
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,120
your energy on improving that

542
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,200
for example if there is a cumbersome

543
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,440
manual review process that folks are

544
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,679
less than thrilled to go through

545
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,840
what can you do to reduce the number of

546
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,039
steps in it

547
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,120
can you automate more of it

548
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,880
can you make it more secure by default

549
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,520
think about ways in which you can build

550
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,320
customer focus into your security team

551
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,720
culture

552
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,039
the second area of focus that i want to

553
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,520
talk about is building a focused

554
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,280
perspective

555
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,760
now hopefully we can all agree that a

556
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,919
security team's job is to manage and

557
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,520
reduce risk

558
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,120
so what is risk risk is likelihood times

559
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,000
impact

560
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
the total amount of risk exposure is the

561
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,880
probability of a bad event occurring

562
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,840
multiplied by the potential impact of

563
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,399
that event

564
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,039
but i actually think security engineers

565
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,000
were really bad at risk

566
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,080
we get hyper focused on impact and we

567
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,880
forget to consider likelihood

568
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,440
which is why everything is always doom

569
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,360
and gloom

570
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,000
and to be better at our jobs of managing

571
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,960
risk

572
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
we need to build

573
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,880
a better perspective on how we think

574
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,120
about risk

575
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,559
risk impact

576
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,960
so thinking about probability and not

577
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,600
just the impact of an event

578
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,440
ryan mcgeehan who some of you may know

579
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,080
as magu has done some great work on

580
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,480
helping engineers understand and speak

581
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,440
risk

582
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,200
i highly recommend you check it out i

583
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,120
will leave the link in my slide that

584
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,200
will be shared afterwards

585
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
and this idea

586
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,679
of risk forecasting and quantification

587
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,039
it can really

588
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,600
help us think about it in more concrete

589
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,440
and time-boxed ways

590
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,240
and it helps us move away from

591
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
preventing all bad outcomes

592
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,880
to reducing the probability of the bad

593
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,159
outcomes

594
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,480
it helps security engineers be more

595
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,840
realistic

596
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,400
about risk and the ways that we can

597
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,240
mitigate it

598
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,200
now

599
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,559
i want to acknowledge

600
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,760
that this is hard and it's imperfect

601
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,159
but it's imperfect in the same ways that

602
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,480
what we are doing now is imperfect

603
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,120
so i think it's worth the effort to

604
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,840
evolve how we think about risk

605
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,240
security teams we also need to build a

606
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,640
clear understanding of the prep model

607
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,200
that our business is operating in

608
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,600
and this should actively guide how you

609
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,760
invest in your program

610
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,159
let's be honest not all companies out

611
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,000
there are protecting against nation

612
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,919
state actors

613
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,919
so you need to know

614
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,159
what are your critical assets who are

615
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,320
your threat actors and what are their

616
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,840
motivations

617
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,559
this can help you be more measured and

618
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,440
deliberate with your security program

619
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,840
and understanding why security matters

620
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
to the business can really help

621
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,760
contextualize your program in the

622
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,559
broader picture

623
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,360
now based on the threat model that you

624
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,919
operate in your security team may have a

625
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,080
certain level of authority to be able to

626
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,600
say no to things

627
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
or maybe you don't have very much

628
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
authority at all you're expected to

629
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,440
operate with

630
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,760
influence and advocacy

631
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,919
no matter your situation i would

632
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,640
strongly urge you to operate with the

633
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,440
principle of holding yourselves

634
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,880
accountable to a high standard on what

635
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,480
is the security guidance that you're

636
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,840
providing and making sure that it aligns

637
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,679
with the risk perspective of your

638
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,000
organization

639
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,840
if someone was to show up at your door

640
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
tomorrow and ask you

641
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,320
explain to me how this decision was made

642
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,559
what is the impact on the company

643
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,400
what what is the assumptions on which

644
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,760
we're operating

645
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,320
we should be able to be transparent

646
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,600
about that

647
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,559
so we need to put a lot of rigor into

648
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,880
the security decisions that we make for

649
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
our stakeholders

650
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,200
be more pragmatic and transparent with

651
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,640
your guidance

652
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,200
this will not only help your security

653
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,240
teams be more thoughtful and pragmatic

654
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,200
but it'll also improve the experience of

655
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,000
your customers

656
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,520
okay so hopefully we can all agree that

657
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
we are never going to do all the things

658
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
but there is a lot of things that need

659
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,159
to get done every day

660
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:22,960
so

661
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,919
having a strategic program focus is

662
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,400
really important for sustainability and

663
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,799
scalability of your program

664
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,960
and your teams

665
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,080
now there's obviously a lot of important

666
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,480
operational services that a security

667
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,039
program provides to the company

668
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,919
individual threat models feature reviews

669
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,039
incident response wall management all of

670
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,480
that fun stuff

671
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,039
but sometimes it can be really easy to

672
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,440
get lost in that operations and lose

673
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,320
focus of the strategic investments that

674
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,200
would enable your long-term success

675
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,679
so once you have a clear idea of the

676
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,679
needs of your organization

677
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,000
it's really important to find the right

678
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,279
balance between spending your time

679
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,200
supporting that day-to-day operational

680
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,159
work versus investing in that long-term

681
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,039
strategic work that lets you get out of

682
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:17,760
the

683
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,320
day-to-day

684
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,799
so if your abstech team is spending most

685
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,279
of their time doing security reviews

686
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,440
they may not have the bandwidth to

687
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,960
really think about

688
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,200
oh is there a way for me to make certain

689
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
baseline controls just default across

690
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,120
the board

691
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,440
but you can't make those investments if

692
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,799
you're always

693
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,600
just

694
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,159
in the operations and don't have the

695
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,000
bandwidth to look up from the day-to-day

696
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,600
you can't patch the boat if you're

697
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,559
always just bailing water

698
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,200
as security leaders we have to get

699
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,840
better at recognizing these patterns on

700
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,200
our teams and make room for them to

701
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,960
invest the time in the long-term

702
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,520
strategic work that would get us out of

703
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,000
the day-to-day operations or streamline

704
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,559
it over time

705
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,200
in addition to this we also need to get

706
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,240
better at clearly articulating what are

707
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,279
the overall goals of our program and

708
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,080
what should our teams be doing to get

709
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,440
there

710
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,720
for example

711
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,919
is your goal to prevent most bugs from

712
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,600
getting to production

713
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,080
is your goal to get everything fixed

714
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,919
within a certain sla

715
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,000
is your goal to just have baseline

716
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
security guarantees and good

717
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,159
observability across your fleet

718
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,880
it's important to be clear about those

719
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,000
focus areas to your teams because this

720
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,080
would allow them to make day-to-day

721
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,880
decisions that are really in line with

722
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,480
the assumptions of kind of what are you

723
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,279
here trying to achieve the answer can be

724
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,799
we're here to secure all the things

725
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,559
because that's just not reasonable it's

726
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,640
never going to happen

727
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,960
because we can never do all the things

728
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,200
and i think that's true no matter how

729
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,760
well-funded your security program is i'm

730
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,840
sure you go to you know the largest

731
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
security team in the bay area and they

732
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,200
will still tell you that they don't have

733
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,840
enough funding

734
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,159
and it's important to set those

735
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,320
strategic goals that are in line with

736
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,360
your threat model and you know how much

737
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,880
investment you're able to make in your

738
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,840
security program so that your teams can

739
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,520
make those thoughtful and measured

740
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,760
decisions every day

741
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,159
one tool that we use for this at netflix

742
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,240
that i really like is this idea of

743
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,919
strategy bets

744
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,799
so strategy bets are basically informed

745
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,399
judgment calls

746
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,760
on

747
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,640
what

748
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,240
what are the bets we're making about our

749
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,200
program

750
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,600
these things need to be tested debated

751
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,559
and altered over time so it's not a 100

752
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,679
obvious choice but it's one of the two

753
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,480
possible routes that we can take

754
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,600
and this idea of taking one of those

755
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,840
possible routes it allows us to be

756
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,159
deliberate about not choosing that other

757
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,360
route and investing our energy into that

758
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,640
so for example our security team has

759
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,919
chosen to focus on this idea of leaning

760
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,000
into the pave roads and securing those

761
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
central points of leverage

762
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,279
now

763
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,799
the other option there is to go meet the

764
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,960
customer teams where they are and secure

765
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,279
every possible technology option i think

766
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,600
that is also a valid path but we have

767
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,559
chosen

768
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,880
that not to be the one that we are

769
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,640
investing our time in

770
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,399
and knowing this

771
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,960
everyone in the organization is able to

772
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,720
be really deliberate about the

773
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,279
investments that they make day to day

774
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,080
and

775
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,679
be confident that that's aligned with

776
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,039
the overall org strategy

777
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,159
another area on program strategy to

778
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,880
think about is where can you find

779
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,039
leverage points and efficiency in your

780
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,080
program

781
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,240
and sometimes that may even be outside

782
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
the security team

783
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,320
some of you may have heard me previously

784
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,120
talk about this idea of hitching the

785
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,600
security wagon to developer productivity

786
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,000
which talks about finding ways to scale

787
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,840
security through developer tools and

788
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,440
experiences

789
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,200
some of my colleagues in information

790
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,440
security and cloud gateway published a

791
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,559
blog post last year on how we did this

792
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,039
to productize certain security controls

793
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,919
through our authentication proxy

794
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,600
so in that case we approached our

795
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,919
security checklist with sort of the

796
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,640
mindset of okay what are the things that

797
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,880
are consistent enough across all of

798
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,039
these applications that we can easily

799
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,000
build into that authentication proxy so

800
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,399
things like the web application firewall

801
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,559
ddos prevention security header

802
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,320
validation

803
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,559
consistent logging all of those things

804
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,760
fit the bill

805
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,559
and what ended up happening is that this

806
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,640
improved sort of the internet facing

807
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,360
controls work not just for our team but

808
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,279
for every customer team that wanted to

809
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,840
put a new app on the internet

810
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,240
we're now trying to realize similar

811
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,399
scalability wins with other parts of our

812
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,960
infrastructure as well

813
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,279
and this not only helps scale our

814
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,799
program but

815
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,760
it also makes security a true partner to

816
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,519
other central teams at the company that

817
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,320
we get to work with

818
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,200
think about how you can create the time

819
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,840
and space for such leverage focused work

820
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,960
on your teams can you make this

821
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,640
specifically a part of your team's

822
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,159
charter

823
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,600
can this be someone's full-time job

824
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,279
because these types of leverage

825
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,919
investments are important in that

826
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,399
long-term scalability and sustainability

827
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,480
and in the world where there are a

828
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,640
million things to do thinking about

829
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,600
critical data assets that have a real

830
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,399
impact on your business can be a strong

831
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,200
guiding light on how to invest your time

832
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,000
so instead of closing every possible

833
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,440
door and window

834
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,279
could you lock down access to those

835
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,840
critical data assets and invest your

836
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,679
time in preventing and detecting

837
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,880
potential impact to that can you find

838
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,200
ways to minimize the exposure to those

839
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,880
critical data assets

840
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,960
figure out tiering criteria to be able

841
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,799
to right-size your investment based on

842
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,799
data categories

843
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,440
top risks should always be the context

844
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,880
in which you make your investment

845
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,120
decision both for proactive and reactive

846
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,000
security controls

847
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,880
and speaking of proactive and reactive

848
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,440
security controls i think there is a

849
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,399
reframing here on overall security

850
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,279
assurance for your program as opposed to

851
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,760
preventative versus reactive work right

852
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,919
so at the end of the day there is an

853
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,799
opportunity for us to really think about

854
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,880
how do those investments complement each

855
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,240
other let's say you can't roll out

856
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,960
comprehensive authorization policies for

857
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,279
a new low trust user type in your

858
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,039
ecosystem for another three quarters

859
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,120
could you work with your detection team

860
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,440
to put some detections in place that

861
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,840
would monitor anomalous activity from

862
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,320
that particular identity type

863
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,919
would that help your security engineers

864
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,039
sleep better at night

865
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,919
in fact you may have areas where your

866
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,000
ability to put in proactive controls is

867
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,480
just limited altogether

868
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,880
let's say you can't fully lock down your

869
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,440
ci cd ecosystem because

870
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,039
let's be honest all your engineers will

871
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,039
hate you and it'll be a developer

872
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,399
experience that is pretty hellish to

873
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,320
work in

874
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,399
so what do you do can you put

875
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,720
locking controls in place to detect

876
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,960
potential attack scenarios that are

877
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,720
fairly common like attempted packet

878
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,480
squats and other ci cd type issues

879
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,200
in this way you can utilize those

880
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,679
reactive controls to compensate for the

881
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,320
limited proactive controls work while

882
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,960
being able to balance the overall

883
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,600
security experience of that particular

884
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,840
world

885
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,800
and last but not the least is the

886
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,359
investments that we should be making in

887
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,279
stakeholder and leadership alignment

888
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,800
more often than not senior leaders do

889
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,879
not know what to expect from their

890
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,719
security program

891
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,040
and of course we talk about how well

892
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,679
it's not their job to know it's our job

893
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,079
but the problem with that approach where

894
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,520
they're not supposed to know what to

895
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,800
expect

896
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,440
guess what what they expect is

897
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,280
nothing bad can ever happen because we

898
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,119
have a security team and then when it

899
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,119
does we'll just fire the cso and move on

900
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,199
with our lives

901
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,119
and that leads to all of this

902
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,359
dysfunction of you know living up to

903
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,159
that impossible expectation of

904
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,040
nothing

905
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,199
bad can ever happen

906
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,760
so as security leaders for the sake of

907
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,400
our teams we need to have a meaningful

908
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,599
conversation about risk appetite

909
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,400
what are the top risks and what does

910
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,560
level of investment in the program mean

911
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,359
for your ability to mitigate those risks

912
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,200
versus not

913
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,560
now we talked a little bit about

914
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,400
quantitative risk before

915
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,640
that can be a great tool to make this a

916
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,280
dollar to dollar comparison about risk

917
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,920
tolerance and security investment

918
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,320
and it will allow you to create clarity

919
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,240
on what's important

920
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,480
and how can you further improve that

921
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,640
story with further investment

922
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,560
now i'm not going to try to explain

923
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,079
quantified risk to you because i'm not

924
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,760
an expert in this space and i'm lucky

925
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,280
enough to work with people who are

926
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,800
experts in this space

927
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,920
um i will be linking out their work on

928
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,320
risk quantification and a blog post that

929
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,640
they wrote about a risk quantification

930
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,400
library that we open sourced a few years

931
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,880
ago so the link will be in my slides for

932
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,119
that

933
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,000
and in this world hopefully you're also

934
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,160
able to work towards some shared guiding

935
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,119
principles between yourself and your

936
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,520
engineering and business counterparts

937
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,000
so let's say if the guiding principle is

938
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,560
that you need to prioritize innovation

939
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,520
above all else then maybe the business

940
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,079
is able to lean into more security risk

941
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,240
and incur the security cost that may

942
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,160
come with that

943
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,880
or if the guiding principle is that you

944
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,359
want to aim for a high prevention

945
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,800
standard on the security controls then

946
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,640
you can align with your business

947
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,160
counterparts and your engineering

948
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,960
leadership on what that will mean for

949
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,640
velocity or developer experience because

950
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,320
let's be honest we're not going to get

951
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
all the things all at once you have to

952
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,040
make some trade-offs somewhere and

953
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,280
having these shared principles with our

954
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,320
counterparts allows us to be thoughtful

955
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,560
and aligned on those trade-offs that we

956
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,200
need to make and there can still be a

957
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
healthy tension with those stakeholders

958
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,400
in this world

959
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,680
but at least you won't be disappointed

960
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,680
by their decisions as much because

961
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,000
you're making them against agreed-upon

962
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,640
principles or you won't be in this

963
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,560
constant state of conflict and

964
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,400
relitigating everything with them all

965
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,720
the time

966
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,599
now with this idea of having shared

967
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,480
principles clarity on top risks risk

968
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
appetite seems like we're going to a

969
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,680
good place

970
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,480
it's also important to create ongoing

971
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,200
visibility for the top risks to your

972
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,560
stakeholders and to senior leadership

973
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,480
all security teams more or less know the

974
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,599
stuff that keeps them up at night

975
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,680
and more often than not it ties back to

976
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,640
the top risk areas for your company

977
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,680
and sometimes this can also be the stuff

978
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,920
that that one security engineer who

979
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,680
feels a really really strong sense of

980
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,599
personal responsibility carries around

981
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,440
with them every day

982
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,680
oh that one team they have that legacy

983
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,000
app well hopefully nothing bad happens

984
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,839
with it

985
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,560
and when you create this visibility

986
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,880
and shared ownership

987
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,920
then

988
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,400
the accountability exists along with

989
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,920
your stakeholders

990
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,839
the security team's not carrying that

991
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,839
around by themselves they're not

992
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,440
worrying about it alone in a corner

993
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,760
and when you have those types of forums

994
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,240
you can utilize them to highlight the

995
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,560
shared wins of the program and the ways

996
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,720
in which you're able to make progress

997
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,640
and improve those relationships as well

998
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,839
and

999
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,720
lastly i cannot overstress the

1000
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,880
importance for showing up for our

1001
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,560
customers with reasonable expectations

1002
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,359
that are in line with your risk appetite

1003
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,960
in your guiding principles for the

1004
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,880
program

1005
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,920
don't be the dentist where no matter how

1006
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,160
hard you try you always get in trouble

1007
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,760
it's like oh you brush twice a day how

1008
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,440
come you don't floss

1009
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,520
no no nobody wants that

1010
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,240
we need to show up for our customers

1011
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,000
with the reasonable approaches that

1012
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,599
align with your risk posture

1013
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,400
okay so we covered a lot of ground there

1014
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,560
why don't we do a quick recap for our

1015
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,280
key takeaways

1016
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,839
there are a lot of factors that can go

1017
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,640
into the lack of sustainability for

1018
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,079
security teams

1019
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,200
ranging from personal cynicism to

1020
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,680
sense of personal failure to evolving

1021
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,880
landscape and stakeholder conflict

1022
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,359
we as security leaders can help improve

1023
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,760
the sustainability of our teams and our

1024
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,960
programs by focusing in a few key areas

1025
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,480
first and foremost

1026
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,040
building a sustainable empathetic

1027
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,680
organizational culture in which people

1028
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,200
feel supported

1029
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,839
energized and excited by their work is

1030
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,359
really important

1031
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,520
you have to disrupt the cynicism you

1032
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,440
have to be intentional about team

1033
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,320
culture you have to celebrate the wins

1034
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,240
and you have to solve for long-term

1035
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,760
sustainability

1036
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,839
it can help build a supportive team

1037
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,760
environment and make security a team

1038
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,000
sport

1039
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,720
second you have to invest in building a

1040
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,520
thoughtful pragmatic risk perspective

1041
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,000
that helps your security team understand

1042
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,480
why security matters to the business and

1043
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,560
how they can show up as thoughtful

1044
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,640
partners to the business

1045
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,040
this can help combat the ongoing

1046
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,839
conflict that we feel with our with our

1047
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,119
stakeholders

1048
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,440
make security a part of overall business

1049
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,000
success and help us get out of that doom

1050
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,720
and gloom mindset

1051
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,359
third is you have to be very deliberate

1052
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,440
about the strategic strategic focus

1053
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,200
areas of your program

1054
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,040
we will never do all the things we're

1055
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,560
not superheroes so as security leaders

1056
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
it is our responsibility

1057
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,520
to set up our team in such a way that

1058
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,960
they have the bandwidth for the

1059
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,680
strategic long-term investments there is

1060
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,160
a clear understanding of the focus areas

1061
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,599
and the guiding principles of your

1062
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,920
program that can guide day-to-day

1063
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,640
decisions that they're making and help

1064
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,839
with measurable reasonable approaches

1065
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,240
stronger cross-functional relationships

1066
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,880
and allowing the team to focus on what's

1067
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,359
really most important

1068
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,000
and last but not the least you have to

1069
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,839
build strong alignment with your

1070
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:26,560
stakeholders and your leadership so you

1071
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,200
have a shared understanding of risk

1072
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,440
appetite and the guiding principles that

1073
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,760
inform your organization

1074
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
it can help ease the pressure that your

1075
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,480
security team feels day-to-day to

1076
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,280
relitigate expectations and carrying

1077
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,920
personal responsibility for areas where

1078
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,359
there may be some reasonable risk

1079
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,440
acceptance

1080
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,079
if we invest in some of these things we

1081
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,720
can build sustainable and scalable

1082
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,960
security programs

1083
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,050

1093

um

1094
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,560
you've got about three

1095
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,839
you minutes your talk in in terms of

1096
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,640
security and external that how in your

1097
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,720
experience which one is toughest like

1098
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,599
how

1099
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,400
is it

1100
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,560
how much time do you spend

1101
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,480
on the internal stuff for your team

1102
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
versus the

1103
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,880
i think as senior leaders oh sorry i'll

1104
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,440
repeat the question so how much time do

1105
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,359
you need to be spending internally with

1106
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,760
your teams versus externally with your

1107
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,160
stakeholders and your leadership i would

1108
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,720
say for senior leaders of the security

1109
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,079
organization your primary job is that

1110
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,000
external alignment with leadership and

1111
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,640
stakeholders that allows your teams to

1112
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,240
execute well against shared principles

1113
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,720
so yeah i think security leaders need to

1114
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,079
think about how they're spending their

1115
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,760
time and it needs to be more outwards

1116
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,560
all right thank you very much
