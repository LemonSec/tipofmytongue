1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:01,439
all right i think we're ready for the

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,760
next talk uh so please welcome jivan

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,000
singh uh jivan is a security engineering

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,480
manager at twilio uh where he's working

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,400
on embedding security into all aspects

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,639
of the software development process uh

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,920
jivan's gonna be talking to us about

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,720
redefining threat modeling

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,400
[Music]

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,279
[Applause]

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,240
i got a little fan section here

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,080
well thank you all for attending my talk

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
um i definitely want to talk about how

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,000
we can redefine what threat modeling is

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,320
so that security folks don't have to be

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,000
everywhere all the time

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,719
and uh let's make let's actually make

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,880
security everyone's responsibility um so

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,320
that we can actually take longer

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
vacations

21
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,719
all right

22
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,960
um i always like to start off with a

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
quote you miss 100 of the

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,120
vulnerabilities you do not threat model

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,680
the great famous michael scott said that

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,760
he's a fantastic security engineer um we

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,920
should definitely follow his advice

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,960
okay

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,000
what's on the agenda for today

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
we're going to cover threat modeling

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,719
basics i want to make sure that we're on

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,800
the same page of what is actually threat

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,479
modeling we're going to talk a little

34
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,400
bit about the self-serve threat modeling

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,560
program what does it actually mean

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
we're going to dive into

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,600
how we actually run it at segment um

38
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,439
then we're gonna do a program

39
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,119
retrospective there are great things

40
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,479
about it they're also challenges we want

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,360
to make sure that we talk all about it

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,439
as part of this talk

43
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,320
okay

44
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,439
um who am i i'm a guy that did way too

45
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,159
much software development in my career

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,840
um i've always been really really

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
interested in security we had a great vp

48
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,159
of security at one company that told me

49
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,600
to join his team

50
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,439
once i did it it literally changed my

51
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,280
life it's the best career decision that

52
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,399
i made

53
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,880
and i try to do that for others so i'm

54
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,439
part of oaas vancouver

55
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,520
i try connecting with other oasp folks

56
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,439
because security is transformative

57
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,360
i was going to talk about the

58
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
fun fact of being real good at uh

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,759
knowing my family but another fun fact

60
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,680
i'm really good at estimations i think

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
my boss and my children believe that

62
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,759
for example i believe that there are

63
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,598
between two and three thousand people in

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,760
this crowd i think there's about

65
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,080
2314 right now so yeah my boss loves my

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,319
estimation abilities

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,520
okay

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,480
so

69
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,560
let's talk about threat modeling uh

70
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
again

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
i don't really want to talk too much

72
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
about the depth of what threat modeling

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,640
is this is not what the talk is about

74
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,000
but i want to make sure that we're all

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,319
on the same page

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,800
what is threat modeling the main goal of

77
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
threat modeling is to determine the

78
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,280
assets in your system and the risks to

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,560
those assets

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,640
threat modeling should be simple it

81
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,879
should be transparent and everyone

82
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,680
should have a voice during threat models

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,440
everyone's viewpoint is different

84
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,200
everyone's career experience is

85
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,120
different and when we all work together

86
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
we can make much more robust threat

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,000
model in general

88
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,280
and why is it important well we always

89
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
talk about shifting left and how

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,760
important it is to shift left well

91
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
threat modeling is actually done in the

92
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,080
design phase it's possible that you can

93
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,239
actually fix vulnerabilities before they

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,599
act you write a single line of code

95
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,760
and it's really really cheap to fix the

96
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
design rather than if you discover

97
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,040
something

98
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,800
once it's been launched and you have to

99
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
re-architect it so it's super super

100
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,440
cheap from that aspect

101
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,239
it's a great way to discover assets

102
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,640
as again threat modeling is you have to

103
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,920
discover your assets and then you want

104
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,480
to talk about the risks to those assets

105
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
so when you architect a solution and you

106
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,159
know what your assets are if you're an

107
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,680
attacker you want to start thinking

108
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,519
about how you can actually attack that

109
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,840
asset or if you have a defensive mindset

110
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
you want to protect that asset so when

111
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,440
you discover those assets as part of

112
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,280
your threat modeling exercise it just

113
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,840
makes it a lot more resilient

114
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,920
um we know as security folks that we

115
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,840
can't fix all of the things it's not

116
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,080
possible and it's not good business wise

117
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,640
so threat modeling really helps

118
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
prioritize your remediation efforts when

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
you discover the risks to your system

120
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,480
you need to figure out which ones you're

121
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,239
actually going to fix so you want to

122
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,840
prioritize those

123
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,760
and for me personally i love threat

124
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
modeling documentations especially of

125
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,839
old when i join a new company or a new

126
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,720
team i want to see how they threat model

127
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,800
how do they think about risk

128
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
and when you have a

129
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,560
bunch of different documents on it you

130
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,120
can be on the same page with your team

131
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,680
um or you may discover that they need to

132
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,759
mature so you want to

133
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,440
as you discover how they do threat

134
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
modeling you can figure out how you can

135
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,400
actually grow that particular team

136
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,880
another great thing about documents is

137
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,120
all threat models go stale so

138
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,720
uh today it might be a low priority

139
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
vulnerability a year two years from now

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,080
it might be a high priority availability

141
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,520
so it's always good to look at your

142
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,880
documents

143
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
and my favorite is

144
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,199
i make a ton of assumptions as part of

145
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,960
the threat modeling process

146
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,639
and

147
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,840
it's always good to have someone

148
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,560
validate it so if you are able to share

149
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
your threat modeling documentation with

150
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,759
security researchers

151
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,880
it's a great way to get a quick check on

152
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,759
if

153
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,120
if your assumptions were valid or not

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,479
and if they were not valid then you can

155
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,960
actually look at additional controls

156
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
so that's what threat modeling is

157
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
let's talk about redefining it

158
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,759
we all know threat modeling is really

159
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,120
hard to scale

160
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,199
is there a way to make it easier and i

161
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,360
should also note this is just one way of

162
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,639
looking at

163
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,720
self-service threat modeling there are a

164
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,919
bunch of different

165
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840
ways that you can actually do it so this

166
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,719
one's worked out really well

167
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,160
before i get into what self-serve threat

168
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
modeling is let's talk about potential

169
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,280
problems

170
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
so

171
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
threat model is really hard to scale

172
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,360
it is really hard to scale

173
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,600
you in most companies you only have very

174
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,880
few folks that actually know how to

175
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,080
threat model and as that company grows

176
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,280
it's not like

177
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,960
you're going to get a lot of more folks

178
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,759
that have that ability to threat model

179
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,000
and if the company grows really quickly

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,080
the issue can get worse and development

181
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,800
might be blocked by security

182
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,479
so

183
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,280
if

184
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,800
development starts getting blocked by

185
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
security or if there's going to be a

186
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
larger queue of threat models that need

187
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
to be done there's only a few ways that

188
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,000
you can get out of that situation so

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,520
either security kills themselves by

190
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,120
threat modeling everything which is not

191
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,039
realistic you want to burn out your

192
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,639
security engineering team

193
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,120
the development team will have to wait

194
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,199
for their threat models which is not

195
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,280
great for a culture you don't want

196
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,759
development team waiting weeks months

197
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,720
for

198
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
getting their systems threat model

199
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
or security will have to pick and choose

200
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,520
which things that they want to threat

201
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,720
model

202
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
which is usually the situation that

203
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,880
really happens the security team will

204
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
have to pick and choose

205
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
the items that they that of highest

206
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,840
priority

207
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,639
so

208
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,639
and that's not great because you're not

209
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,319
going to have eyes everywhere where you

210
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,080
might need it

211
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,520
so um

212
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,599
and i actually believe that security

213
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,520
engineers should focus on the most

214
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,759
important problems in general

215
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,280
threat modeling might be it but it might

216
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,639
not be it um so if you are you have so

217
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,240
much operational load where you have to

218
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,919
threat model all of the things you're

219
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,120
not going to be actually focusing on

220
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,479
things that might be way more important

221
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,759
for the business

222
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,160
might be implementing security tooling

223
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,759
looking at things that

224
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,360
maybe actually threat modeling is but

225
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,880
you can't get to all the threat models

226
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,160
so you we really want to make sure that

227
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,479
we are able to allow the

228
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,919
engineering team security engineer team

229
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,520
to have the autonomy to figure out what

230
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,560
they really need to focus on

231
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
okay

232
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,960
so in my utopian world developers are

233
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
going to do the vast majority of threat

234
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,199
models

235
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,560
that means that they're going to

236
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,400
identify the assets they're going to

237
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
discover risks to those assets they're

238
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,039
going to prioritize those risks and

239
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:55,919
figure out what they're going to

240
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,680
remediate

241
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,599
it will be the responsibility from end

242
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,080
to end to do all of that

243
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,919
the security team should really focus on

244
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,759
training developers to become better

245
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,479
threat modelers

246
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,639
they're going to be gaps as part of the

247
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,000
training process and you'll discover

248
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,080
that when you see the threat models you

249
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
have to understand what those gaps are

250
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,560
and

251
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,440
build it into your training program

252
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,800
new employees will get all of the

253
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,039
training but you should also be building

254
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,199
training for those that are good at it

255
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,120
to make them even better we want

256
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
everyone to be better and better and

257
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,199
better ideally they can become

258
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,440
engineers can be as good as intermediate

259
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,799
security engineers or even senior

260
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,679
security engineers

261
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,679
self-serve threat modeling is a great

262
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,399
way to scale with any size organization

263
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,000
if your engineering team knows how to

264
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,120
threat model doesn't matter if you have

265
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
100

266
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,560
engineers or 10 000 you're going to be

267
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,360
able to threat model all of the things

268
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
and last my favorite goal is actually to

269
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,279
make a bunch of mini security engineers

270
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,040
throughout the organization

271
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,720
when you have a bunch of mini security

272
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,399
engineers they're going to be finding

273
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,880
bad things all over the place and as an

274
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,399
engineer if you find something that's

275
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,720
wrong you have incentive to actually fix

276
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
it yourself you're empowered you want to

277
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,640
fix the problems that you've discovered

278
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,880
so it just that cycle is so much better

279
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,160
that way

280
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,720
the centralized security model is dead

281
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
we cannot have engineers come to us and

282
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,880
ask us about security problems we really

283
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,040
have to push all of our knowledge to the

284
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,880
engineers themselves they have to

285
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
understand security they have to own the

286
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,360
risk themselves

287
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,000
okay so does that solve our problems

288
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
threat modeling is hard scale well if

289
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,160
engineers are good at threat modeling it

290
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,440
doesn't matter

291
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
we are going to be able to scale for any

292
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,519
size organization

293
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,080
will engineers be blocked by security

294
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,399
well nope since they are able to

295
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,680
threaten model themselves they don't

296
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,959
have to wait for us they can go ahead

297
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,959
and do what they need to do

298
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,399
and finally

299
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,240
security engineers will be able to focus

300
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,920
on the most important tasks and it might

301
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,080
it might exactly be threat modeling but

302
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,680
they are able to have the autonomy to

303
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
sort of figure out what's the biggest

304
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,680
risk to the systems

305
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
okay

306
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,959
does that mean it's vacation time

307
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,120
well unfortunately just not yet uh

308
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,880
self-serving doesn't mean that security

309
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,800
is no longer involved as part of the

310
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
threat modeling process i say that they

311
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
should be doing the most threat modeling

312
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,440
but me personally i still want to be a

313
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
part of the conversations where there's

314
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
authentication or authorization if

315
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,720
there's phi or if there are services

316
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,399
that are directly onto the internet i

317
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,839
want to be part of those conversations i

318
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,120
want to make sure that we're making the

319
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,560
right decisions there

320
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,720
um self-serve modeling also means that

321
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,880
we cannot blame developers if they miss

322
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,640
something so if they miss something

323
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,839
there's something fundamentally wrong

324
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,480
with a program we and if it's a similar

325
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
sort of problem maybe we're really bad

326
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,160
at broken access controls we want to

327
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,519
build that into the training so that

328
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,040
they get better at discovering those

329
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,000
things

330
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,880
and

331
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
unfortunately it also means that we're

332
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,360
not out of a job as we all know if we

333
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,040
have one of our responsibilities taken

334
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,480
away there are going to be two like a

335
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,640
security hydra two of them will pop up

336
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
in its place

337
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,240
okay how's this program actually set up

338
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
well first you actually need to get

339
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,360
buy-in

340
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,680
and buy-in shouldn't be that difficult

341
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,279
it is challenging but it shouldn't be

342
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,880
that difficult you need to get the

343
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,120
engineering and the executive teams to

344
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,680
buy into the program and mostly because

345
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,519
it is a big commitment we're shifting a

346
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,040
lot of responsibilities from the

347
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,120
security team to the actual engineering

348
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,880
team but you want to hit on the key

349
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
benefits

350
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,160
you're going to have faster development

351
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,320
time and better security so faster

352
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
development time because they're no

353
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,839
longer being blocked by the security

354
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,399
team for threat models but we're also

355
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,480
for every single feature

356
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,519
we're also

357
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,519
looking at threat modeling which we're

358
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,920
doing security by design and by the time

359
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,519
it gets to production we should have

360
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,839
fewer vulnerabilities in general

361
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,800
and

362
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,200
there is minimal engineering time

363
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
required for training and i'll talk

364
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,800
about that when i hit the

365
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,320
other sides but there's absolutely

366
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,160
minimal amount of engineering time for

367
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,320
training required

368
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,519
okay

369
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,000
four phases training phase observation

370
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,240
review and security optional

371
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,959
my opinion it's really training and

372
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,959
security optional um training phase

373
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,639
observation and review phase are just

374
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,560
different sorts of training phases and

375
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,160
security optional is when it's actually

376
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
security optional

377
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
and i'm gonna break it down for all of

378
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,399
them so self-serve threat modeling means

379
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,760
engineers have to know how to threat

380
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,120
model it kind of

381
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,160
makes sense

382
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,240
um but we have to make sure that we

383
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
enhance engineering teams motivation to

384
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,639
learn they want you should want them to

385
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,320
want to be there

386
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,399
and in order to do that for me um i

387
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,440
would need to make sure that the

388
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,760
material is very

389
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
fun and engaging if it's not fun and

390
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,360
engaging i'm gonna it's gonna glance

391
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,959
over for me

392
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,120
so you wanna make sure that the sessions

393
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
are interactive

394
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,120
they're small they're intimate so that

395
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,079
you could actually talk to the

396
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,240
individuals they're not afraid to speak

397
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,040
up so that they can ask questions

398
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,800
ask a lot of questions for the group

399
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,760
themselves keep them on their toes

400
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,200
and you have to realize security is a

401
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,959
marathon and not a sprint

402
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,320
you don't have to

403
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,560
give all of the training at one point

404
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,959
they're employees you can give deliver

405
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,639
training all all the time they're

406
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,440
they're with you most of the time

407
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
and it makes it the training an easier

408
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,760
way to learn when when you can spread it

409
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,959
out

410
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,040
and also teach engineers things that are

411
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,959
relevant to your business

412
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,760
so

413
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,120
it should be done in the same vein

414
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,399
threat modeling training should be done

415
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,000
the same vein as how you threaten all in

416
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
your

417
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,399
organization

418
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,320
so if you do if you use stride to

419
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
discover vulnerabilities teach them how

420
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,639
to use stride if you want to do risk

421
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,240
assessments teach the engineering team

422
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
how to do risk assessments

423
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,480
the goal of the training is to train the

424
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,639
engineers to retain the most amount of

425
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,199
information

426
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,240
with those principles in mind we

427
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,839
actually built out the training to have

428
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,120
uh

429
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,000
three distinct trainings over a six six

430
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,399
week period so week zero

431
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,920
we had one week three and week six

432
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,800
and we

433
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,720
broke it out because anytime i went to

434
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,079
black hat or an oauth training

435
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,680
i didn't really retain too much

436
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,560
information i get eight hours 16 hours

437
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,800
of training and

438
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,440
i i i want to say i think i'm smart but

439
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
i probably retain about 10 of what i got

440
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,279
trained so

441
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,279
these are your employees break it out

442
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,959
make it digestible make sure that they

443
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,120
can actually learn

444
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,160
the

445
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,560
the first training that we did uh we i

446
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,079
want to introduce the concept of threat

447
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,120
modeling so

448
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,600
we talked about stride with a lot about

449
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
the theory we did

450
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,440
very little actual hands-on because i

451
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,720
really wanted them to understand the

452
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,440
theory the second one we introduced

453
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,120
assets and data classifications which

454
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,880
are important to our business

455
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,360
so we got to get them once we introduced

456
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,639
those topics it didn't take too much

457
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,519
long too much time we got them to do a

458
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,880
lot of hands-on

459
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,480
threat modeling at that point so get

460
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,160
their hands a little bit dirty a lot

461
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,079
more than the first session and the

462
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,240
third one ideally you're threat mulling

463
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,600
with a single team you're teaching a

464
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
single team

465
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,959
find something that they own find a

466
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,959
feature that they own do a deep dive

467
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:15,839
into it

468
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,199
and teach them how to do threat modeling

469
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,800
from end to end as part of that session

470
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,120
exactly how you do it in your business

471
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,360
the good thing is segment has allowed us

472
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,320
to

473
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,160
open source the training all the

474
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
training is open source please use them

475
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,839
don't start from scratch

476
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,440
i'll provide links at the very end

477
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,800
so a few takeaways from the training

478
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
phase

479
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,560
it takes years for security folks to get

480
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,839
good at threat modeling i know it took

481
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,240
me a long time so don't expect the

482
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,639
engineers to get it right away be there

483
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,360
support them build them up

484
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
and you need to bring the training to

485
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,959
them um and the way that i did that is

486
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,800
we started off with physical concepts

487
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,199
that they understood personal safety i

488
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,440
talked about a house how do you secure a

489
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,360
house what are the type of threats there

490
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,800
and once you move from once they

491
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
understand the different type of

492
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,639
vulnerabilities as part of that you move

493
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
it into the software world you show them

494
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
okay it's the same thing but it's just

495
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,240
different terminology it's the same

496
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,000
thing at all

497
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,880
and then

498
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,120
lots and lots of hands-on practice i

499
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,040
need hands-on practice when i'm learning

500
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,519
things so making sure that they had it

501
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,199
and part of it we actually broke out

502
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,279
into many groups where people were able

503
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,560
to discuss some of the vulnerabilities

504
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,079
that they discovered as part of the

505
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,839
training exercises

506
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,000
um failing fast uh

507
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,320
training you can spend so much time on

508
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,839
building up your training um don't do

509
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,600
that fail fast

510
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,440
come up with the training deliver to

511
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,320
engineering team and iterate on it

512
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,079
i struggle for about a month with the

513
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,800
training my boss smart guy he pushed me

514
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,720
to just put it out there and iterate on

515
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
it and it took me two weeks to get it to

516
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
98 percent

517
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,720
and training is hard over zoom

518
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,440
i've always done workshops in real life

519
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,280
i can look people in the eyes i can see

520
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,959
if they're actually understanding things

521
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,319
training was really really hard to

522
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,720
resume i got people to keep their videos

523
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,959
on and i kept everything engaging so i

524
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,359
asked random people questions

525
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,400
so

526
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,160
they were always kept on their toes and

527
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,839
they were kept on uh

528
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,839
they were definitely kept on their toes

529
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,119
so much so that i remember one

530
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,359
engineering manager was so afraid to go

531
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,959
to the washroom because he might get

532
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,559
called on so

533
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,400
definitely keep that fear in them for

534
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,679
the training so that they're engaged

535
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,760
all right

536
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,600
and then we have a lot of real good

537
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
testimonials

538
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,919
if you make the training really engaging

539
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,160
they want to be there they want to learn

540
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,480
more and they're going to deliver your

541
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,320
threat models even better if they really

542
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
want to learn the material

543
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,280
nothing can replace good training

544
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,240
okay

545
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
so observation phase i sort of mentioned

546
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,440
that it is training version 2.

547
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,080
you want the engineer themselves to put

548
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,320
together the entire documentation they

549
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
have to lead the sessions themselves

550
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,600
you're going to security is going to be

551
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,960
there they're going to be observing

552
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
what's going on

553
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,760
you want to make sure that they

554
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,120
can again

555
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,000
the

556
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,760
things that they need to do is identify

557
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,960
the assets

558
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,880
figure out the risks prioritize the

559
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,320
risks and figure out which ones they're

560
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,600
going to remediate

561
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,000
you'll have an engineering dri

562
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
and you make sure that they know what

563
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,039
their role is as part of this process

564
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,240
the goal is to get engineering to do

565
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,120
this

566
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,799
by themselves and to find all the

567
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,480
critical and high vulnerabilities on

568
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
their own you don't want to be telling

569
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,240
them what they are as part of the threat

570
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,960
modeling process

571
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,440
so some takeaways

572
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,520
be a coach be a mentor

573
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,440
don't tell them what the threats are as

574
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,360
part of the threat modeling sessions you

575
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,039
actually want to just let them co try to

576
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,600
give the right questions to spark that

577
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,080
idea in their eyes so that they discover

578
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,600
it and then they can do it on their own

579
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,679
next time

580
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,280
i actually helped a lot of the engineers

581
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
with the documentation so a few days

582
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
before the threat modeling session

583
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,520
themselves i jump on a 101 i talk

584
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,880
through and say okay these are your

585
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,640
responsibilities you have to lead your

586
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,320
leader in this

587
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,400
threat model you have to

588
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,480
make sure that the people are talking

589
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,720
everyone's

590
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,880
everyone's bringing their ideas

591
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480
and then it gives you an opportunity to

592
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,559
actually sell threat modeling

593
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,160
thermal is a team support so you make

594
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
sure that the dri that's responsible for

595
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,240
the throttle engineering dri they're

596
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,400
bringing the right people into the

597
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,039
threat model and they need to make sure

598
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,960
that uh

599
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,320
that again again that no one's quiet as

600
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,520
a part of it

601
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,679
and ideally you can close the loop with

602
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,720
the

603
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,559
engineer afterwards so if they did a

604
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,080
great job let them know that they did a

605
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,280
great job if they needed a little bit

606
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,039
more coaching give them a little bit

607
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
more coaching

608
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,240
please note some people are really

609
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,679
really natural at it

610
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,840
literally the first self-serve threat

611
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,799
modeling session that i did was me and a

612
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,880
principal security engineer

613
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
we were doing it with

614
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,080
two senior engineers

615
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,120
and we provided zero value as a part of

616
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,799
that session

617
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,760
i felt actually i felt great that the

618
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,440
program worked but i felt bad that i

619
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,120
wasn't able to really provide anything

620
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,880
to them they felt like they already

621
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,120
learned everything so super super proud

622
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,000
of those individuals

623
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,120
again close the loop uh this particular

624
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,640
engineer did a fantastic session

625
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,280
he was without prompting from us he was

626
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,960
calling out everyone that was really

627
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,880
really quiet in the session i had a

628
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
conflict i had to leave halfway and i

629
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,320
felt comfortable leaving halfway because

630
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
i knew he was doing such a great job

631
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,840
he's still one of our top

632
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,559
threat modelers

633
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,039
review phase

634
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,559
this is where

635
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,400
things are a little bit more challenging

636
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,240
security is no longer in the room we're

637
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,520
going to actually be looking at the

638
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,039
artifacts and making sure that

639
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,520
everything looks uh well

640
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,559
so

641
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,559
again their engineers are going to keep

642
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,159
iterating the four things they have to

643
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,400
discover assets they have to

644
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,600
figure out the risks they have to

645
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,200
prioritize the risks and figure out

646
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,320
which ones are going to mediate they're

647
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,080
going to do that all without you and

648
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,799
you're just going to look at the

649
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,039
artifacts and you know that they're

650
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,880
doing a good job when they have all of

651
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,240
the critical and high vulnerabilities

652
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,840
done by themselves

653
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,760
in reality we've run into this situation

654
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,960
a lot of times when it should have been

655
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,520
the observation phase some folks like me

656
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
i don't follow instructions very well

657
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,720
some folks

658
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
they were

659
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,080
they thought they saw the threat

660
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,640
modeling section in the design document

661
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,240
so they filled it up when we got to the

662
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,320
threat modeling session it was fantastic

663
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,039
um there were 90 percent of the risks

664
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,960
were already covered we just had to push

665
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,320
them to find the last 10 percent

666
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,120
um

667
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,880
hopefully when we give

668
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,039
the talk next year we'll give you a lot

669
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,840
more

670
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,799
actual metrics of how this all turned

671
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,120
out on the review phase

672
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,200
security optional uh

673
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,720
everything should be threat model like

674
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
literally everything should be threat

675
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,679
model all your developers will know how

676
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,120
to threat model so there should be no

677
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,799
part of your system that is not getting

678
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,159
threat modeled

679
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,679
security should only be involved in the

680
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,679
most sensitive things i already talked

681
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,000
about being part of the authentication

682
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,840
authorization phi anything on the

683
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,799
internet

684
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,480
security is literally optional we should

685
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,240
be spending times on the most important

686
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,640
problems if it start modeling sure but

687
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,000
if it's not threat modeling let's spend

688
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
our time there

689
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
in this phase we should start seeing a

690
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,679
drop in the number of vulnerabilities

691
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,520
that are being discovered as part of

692
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,720
third party

693
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,280
tests so bug bounty pentest we should

694
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,720
see a significant drop at that point

695
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,559
and

696
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,240
hopefully we have to actually pay our

697
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,679
researchers a lot more to find

698
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,440
vulnerabilities as well so that's

699
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,880
another signal that you can use

700
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,799
and for now you can kick up your feet

701
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,960
for reals

702
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,000
okay

703
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,240
program learnings and there were a lot

704
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
of things that we learned about this

705
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,360
particular program

706
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,720
so

707
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,000
this isn't rainbows and cookies uh this

708
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,320
was a really really challenging program

709
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,400
there are a lot of challenges as a part

710
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,159
of it

711
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,280
we'll start with it is a multi-year

712
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,520
program i'm going to emphasize the year

713
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,760
part

714
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,679
you need

715
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,640
it can't rely on a single dri security

716
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,880
to actually run the program

717
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,280
especially in this hot market it's uh

718
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,840
you don't rely on one person but

719
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,279
you also don't want to burn out that one

720
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,320
person

721
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,799
running this sort of program as well

722
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,640
so you need to make sure that you have a

723
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,559
group of folks that are actually running

724
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,679
this program they're all on the same

725
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,400
page

726
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,559
and it's a large and key investment from

727
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,080
the secure team and actually it's a

728
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,200
large and key investment from the

729
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,640
engineering team as well

730
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,159
so you need to make sure that there are

731
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,600
a group of folks that can actually run

732
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,760
it themselves

733
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,559
training is hard training is really hard

734
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,919
and it's hard for a lot of different

735
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:06,960
reasons

736
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,240
first reason is

737
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,400
you have to train a large number of

738
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,440
people so as part of the program

739
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,720
i personally trained 120 engineers

740
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,480
it was the course of two quarters and i

741
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,880
burnt myself out with trading um

742
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,120
definitely don't do that make sure that

743
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,520
you have other trainers as a part of it

744
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
uh i took a quarter off from trading's

745
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,760
because i just didn't want to do

746
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,279
delivering the same training in and out

747
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,039
day and day kind of can get boring as

748
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,799
well so you might want to make sure you

749
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,039
have a stable of trainers as a part of

750
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,640
that

751
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,240
um have you ever delivered someone

752
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,600
else's presentation

753
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,120
i've done that in the past that's really

754
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,360
hard too it's not your content you don't

755
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,440
own it you're not really super familiar

756
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,200
with it as well so you want to make sure

757
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,039
that the trainers that you have you give

758
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,880
them the autonomy so that they actually

759
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,480
own the training themselves let them

760
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,720
modify it make it their own you're going

761
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,400
to be covering the same sort of topics

762
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
but it's going to be their own and they

763
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
can deliver that training much much

764
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,440
better themselves

765
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,720
you still have your regular threat

766
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,640
modeling challenges

767
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,880
are devs threat modeling all the things

768
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,760
um

769
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,520
maybe maybe not

770
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,520
so you've got to make sure that you

771
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,600
continue to focus on uplifting your

772
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,679
threat modeling program

773
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,640
we have some challenges on the segment

774
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,240
side where

775
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,760
we weren't sure if developers were

776
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,520
threat modeling all the things

777
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,200
and

778
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,279
the way that we were storing our threat

779
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,440
models was all over the place

780
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,360
fortunately twilio is a little bit more

781
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,760
systematic we have a single or folder

782
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,840
where we store things but there are some

783
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
learnings that from the segment that we

784
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,120
can do things a little bit better

785
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,159
i talked about training folks at segment

786
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,640
twilio is a lot larger than segment it

787
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,080
is considerably larger it's 20x size of

788
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,400
segment so scaling this program

789
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,279
to large enterprises is super super hard

790
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,080
we have maybe now 200 engineers on the

791
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,960
segment side we probably have 2500 3 000

792
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
engineers on twilio so you really have

793
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,120
to have a strong investment to and you

794
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,880
have to have a strategy on how you're

795
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,919
going to train everyone so it is not an

796
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,919
easy program at the enterprise levels

797
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,320
i'm hoping that

798
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
someone on the team can talk about it

799
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,480
more next year

800
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,840
we'll be definitely rolling this out at

801
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,120
the twilio scale

802
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
at some point

803
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,799
lastly it's really hard to maintain a

804
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,000
good ratio of people that are trained

805
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,080
i had wrote this note

806
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,799
before the market got really hard and

807
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,039
there's a lot of attrition it's doubly

808
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,880
triple even harder now

809
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,640
a lot of the trained people leave the

810
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
organization and you have a lot of new

811
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,720
folks coming in so the ratio is really

812
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,400
really tough to

813
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,159
maintain a good ratio is really hard to

814
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,559
maintain

815
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,120
so

816
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,200
um i talked about the challenges but

817
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,679
there are a ton of wins as well

818
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,799
we are threat modeling so much more it's

819
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,799
not it's night and day with how much

820
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,480
we're threat modeling now

821
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,240
the organization is

822
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,400
less afraid to threat model

823
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,279
it's

824
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,640
achievable they understand they

825
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,000
understand the process engineers

826
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,039
understand the process they're not

827
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,799
afraid to reach out

828
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,520
so

829
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,360
we they're doing it a lot more often we

830
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,000
embedded the threat modeling template

831
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
as part of their design document so they

832
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,279
are always aware they know what the

833
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,960
steps are they have to take in order to

834
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,480
properly do their design document

835
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,360
um

836
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,120
engineers are really good at threat

837
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,600
modeling it is crazy how good they are

838
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
at threat modeling

839
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,960
there are times where we've been doing

840
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,799
threat modeling sessions and

841
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,440
they know their system so well they know

842
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,279
everything where all the bodies are

843
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,520
buried into the system so when you tune

844
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,960
them to find discover security

845
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,480
vulnerabilities they're going to find

846
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,520
them

847
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,840
security folks like me we come in we

848
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,919
learn about your system it's an hour two

849
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,159
hours maximum to learn about your system

850
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,360
and we're supposed to find all the

851
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,600
vulnerabilities uh which is not

852
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,799
realistic

853
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,200
um there will be

854
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,799
situations where

855
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,720
it would take me maybe

856
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,399
eight sixteen hours to find

857
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,080
vulnerabilities that engineers are able

858
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,520
to find just because they already know

859
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,960
their system so

860
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,039
it's way way more proficient to actually

861
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,799
train the engineers

862
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:21,919
they don't have to find all the big

863
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,760
things they have to find big things but

864
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,880
they don't have to find all of the

865
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,440
things so again i always harp on making

866
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,960
sure that they find the critical and the

867
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,720
high vulnerabilities

868
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,320
we're going to be part of all the threat

869
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
modeling sessions where

870
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,080
it's really really high risks risky

871
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,520
areas of the system

872
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,640
there we're going to find all other

873
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,919
things but

874
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,760
all the other systems that we don't find

875
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,000
are high risk

876
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
they'll be able to find the critical and

877
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,520
high that's and that's good enough for

878
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,760
us

879
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,720
um our security culture improved leaps

880
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,760
and bounds and it's been crazy how well

881
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,559
our security culture improved one of the

882
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,159
stories i have there is that

883
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,919
at the time a lot of our security

884
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,440
engineers were on the pacific time zone

885
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,240
and one day segment is a golang and node

886
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,080
shop and one day node dropped a high

887
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,760
vulnerability patch

888
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,799
so

889
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,480
one of the engineering managers on the

890
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,399
east coast he discovered that

891
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,640
vulnerability he's like okay this is

892
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,720
applicable to my team he patched his

893
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,880
team he notified the two other managers

894
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,679
that were east coast and they were

895
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,279
a form they had

896
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,279
put plans into place on how when they're

897
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,200
going to mitigate it this was all before

898
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,039
anyone on the pacific coast came even

899
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,360
online so there were a lot of different

900
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,320
anecdotal situations like that where

901
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,240
it just vastly improved our security

902
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,320
culture in general

903
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,960
and i'm going to harp on it again

904
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,120
failing fast was critical to the rapid

905
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,840
improvements both with the training

906
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,880
itself and the process as well so with

907
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,200
respect to the process we didn't really

908
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,679
know when should we promote someone from

909
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,440
the observation phase to the review

910
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,480
phase

911
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
fail fast figure out what's applicable

912
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,520
for you and your company

913
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,159
all right

914
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,840
resources

915
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,360
so um i sort of mentioned that we have

916
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,960
the

917
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,919
pdfs of the training available um

918
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,240
it was it's very close to what we used

919
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,440
internally

920
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,919
for our trainings we removed some of the

921
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,120
vulnerability information i didn't want

922
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,520
to share those things with the

923
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,480
open source community so we have a blog

924
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,960
post on it email me

925
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
at sstm selfservice.modding at

926
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,240
segment.com or dm me

927
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,720
i am very open to sharing our

928
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,640
experiences there's so much we can do as

929
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,159
part of a talk but i can get down to the

930
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,919
nitty-gritty i already talked to at

931
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,240
least a couple dozen companies about how

932
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,320
we have implemented it i don't mind

933
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,679
spending the time i feel that uh like

934
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,000
we we are all a community and i want to

935
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,840
emphasize that we're all a community we

936
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,360
need to work together to make our

937
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,880
software safer

938
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,640
so if you need to reach out to me i have

939
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,320
no problems there will be times where i

940
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,159
need to reach out to you

941
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:12,880
to

942
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,600
better understand your systems as well

943
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,799
we don't need to hide things from each

944
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,480
other

945
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,480
all right

946
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,830
thank you

947
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,730
[Applause]

948
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,200
do we have any questions

949
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,840
yes

950
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,679
a great question

951
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,760
okay the question is

952
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,519
how do you overcome the challenge of

953
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,880
finding

954
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,039
bad things in your own system because

955
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,480
you're sort of like a parent to this

956
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,600
code

957
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
it depends on people's personalities as

958
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
well i remember working at a company a

959
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,760
few companies ago where i spent five

960
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,000
years building this one system and then

961
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,840
i knew for the business to move forward

962
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,360
i have to put all the effort to actually

963
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,519
kill this system and so we can move on

964
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,519
to the next generation so some parents

965
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,679
are bad like me

966
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:24,880
there are a lot of good parents where

967
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,799
they want to protect their child i i

968
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,640
don't think i came across that sort of

969
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,840
problem um

970
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,240
as part of the process we did have

971
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,640
folks that were just harder to for them

972
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,480
to understand vulnerabilities as part of

973
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,039
their system we tried coaching them so

974
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,279
again as part of the threat modeling

975
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,679
the actual sessions where security as is

976
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,840
in there your job is to coach a mentor i

977
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
don't want to tell you as a good parent

978
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,159
i don't want to tell my kids if they're

979
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,240
i'll hint at them when they're behaving

980
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,240
misbehaving but i want them to discover

981
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,480
when they're misbehaving so similarly i

982
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
want to make sure that the

983
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,960
the engineers themselves are

984
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,559
finding the vulnerabilities themselves

985
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,760
and if they aren't i'm going to drop

986
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,440
hints if they aren't i'm going to point

987
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,120
a little bit closer and if they're not

988
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,360
then i finally will actually tell them

989
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,600
what they are but these are

990
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,360
mentorship sessions we want to make sure

991
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,760
that we're continuously telling them and

992
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,360
getting them better as part of the

993
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
process

994
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,120
yeah go ahead

995
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,120
okay

996
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,440
yeah uh that

997
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,039
that really depends on

998
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,200
sorry the question was how long does it

999
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,080
take uh engineer with no experience to

1000
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,600
actually be good proficient at threat

1001
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,320
modeling that really changes uh with

1002
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,760
engineered engineer um most senior staff

1003
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
principal level ones they didn't require

1004
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,080
much training like they did the training

1005
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,159
and then shortly afterwards maybe a

1006
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,840
threat model maybe two they're already

1007
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,519
really really proficient at it it was

1008
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,519
the junior and the intramural folks that

1009
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,600
really needed a lot more help which is

1010
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,360
okay they're junior and intermediate

1011
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,760
folks they they that's why they're at

1012
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,440
that level but

1013
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,119
we're there to coach them and guide them

1014
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,520
and then the ultimate situation would be

1015
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,960
if you train

1016
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,040
the engineers so well they can deliver

1017
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,320
that training they can deliver that

1018
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
mentorship so that circle

1019
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,918
as part of their team is closed very

1020
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,679
quickly

1021
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,280
perfect i i know i had a question here

1022
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,280
first

1023
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,399
good the question is around how do you

1024
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:41,679
how do you deal with the pushback from

1025
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,320
engineering management management so we

1026
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,159
talked a little bit about the amount of

1027
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,679
threat modeling training there's three

1028
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,159
training courses it was a total of five

1029
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,079
hours first one was hour and a half

1030
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,599
second one hour and a half last one was

1031
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,199
two hours

1032
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,040
five hours of training is not bad at all

1033
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,160
and then the threat modeling session

1034
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,680
they have to do them anyways they're

1035
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,440
supposed to be every feature should be

1036
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,400
threat model

1037
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,079
so we're adding maybe about another half

1038
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,920
an hour to the engineer's time as part

1039
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,839
of that threat modeling session so the

1040
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,640
buy-in itself was very easy to implement

1041
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,440
and at the at the end of the day we we

1042
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,280
sold them on the fact that

1043
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,960
your velocity is going to go up

1044
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,359
considerably so first we're going to be

1045
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,440
threat modeling all of the things so

1046
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,480
we're going to be

1047
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,400
having a lot theoretically we should

1048
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
have a lot fewer vulnerabilities if you

1049
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,520
have fewer vulnerabilities it's going to

1050
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,440
be fewer

1051
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,760
hours put into doing security work

1052
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,520
and it'll be those hours you can use for

1053
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,599
development and future work so that's

1054
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,599
how we sold it to them told them long

1055
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,720
term you're going to be saving a lot

1056
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
more time in general

1057
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,720
perfect

1058
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
yes this is yeah we can definitely tie

1059
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,800
it to eric's budget talk

1060
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,119
close the loop

1061
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,240
so the question was

1062
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,160
what's the ratio of

1063
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,359
security engineers to engineers and

1064
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,599
especially as an organization

1065
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,480
matures i've seen it different at so

1066
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,680
many different companies it really

1067
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,320
depends on the companies themselves but

1068
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,280
again the program's goal is to actually

1069
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,880
build mini security engineers everywhere

1070
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,839
and

1071
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,240
at companies that are smaller smaller

1072
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,240
startups you can do that considerably

1073
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,400
faster at larger enterprise you have to

1074
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
be very focused on the people that you

1075
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,440
want to actually develop so maybe you

1076
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,040
want to develop your architects first

1077
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,520
because they have a lot more sway in how

1078
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
the technology is going to be built so

1079
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,599
you spend the vast majority of time

1080
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,000
there or maybe your principal engineers

1081
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,720
in general so at a larger organization

1082
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,400
you want to be very

1083
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,079
focused on the type of folks that you

1084
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,880
want to actually train

1085
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,800
perfect

1086
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,800
yes

1087
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,200
yeah so

1088
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,960
yes great question

1089
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,520
by mistake we discovered that the best

1090
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,119
way to

1091
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,680
oh sorry good question okay

1092
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,359
how do we document vulnerabilities

1093
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,480
discovered as part of the threat

1094
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,000
modeling process

1095
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,400
by a happy mistake we found out the best

1096
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,599
way to

1097
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,560
find

1098
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,680
to

1099
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,440
create vulnerabilities

1100
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,599
threat modeling vulnerabilities was

1101
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,160
actually create vulnerability tickets so

1102
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
that we actually filed real text after

1103
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,400
every threat modeling session and it was

1104
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,880
great because then we can keep track of

1105
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,119
it if it's through documentation we lose

1106
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,079
track

1107
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,000
that either the threat modeling

1108
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,119
ticket stays open um and

1109
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,960
it was just a challenge that way so we

1110
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,440
just actually filed real tickets they'll

1111
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,160
have to follow slas if they

1112
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,920
end in slas it's

1113
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,839
it's kind of weird because it's

1114
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,280
not technically a vulnerability because

1115
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,000
it's a design flaw at that point but

1116
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,160
they'll come up with slas and as part of

1117
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,480
the sla extension process

1118
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,160
we can sort of figure out hey is this

1119
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,040
actually

1120
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,720
going to be

1121
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,800
do we are we actually continually

1122
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,160
working on this feature was the

1123
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,240
priorities changed so we have those

1124
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,440
discussions as a part of that whole

1125
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,520
process

1126
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,560
perfect

1127
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,799
yeah

1128
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,880
love it

1129
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,839
the

1130
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,520
question is how do you ensure the

1131
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,680
quality of threat models stay well over

1132
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,760
time during the security optional phase

1133
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,960
uh one of the things that we want to do

1134
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,640
is make sure that we continuously take a

1135
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,960
sample and we're actually reviewing the

1136
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,520
artifacts after the fact so that you you

1137
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,680
actually can make sure that the quality

1138
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,480
of threat models stay well over time

1139
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,160
and in addition to it you should

1140
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,000
continuously build more threat modeling

1141
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,079
training so you have your 100 level you

1142
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,920
should have your 2 and 300 level ones so

1143
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,760
that you continuously training folks

1144
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,440
that have been threat modeling so that

1145
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
they remember and do other things as a

1146
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,839
part of it

1147
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,240
perfect

1148
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,240
all right

1149
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,799
oh sorry yeah

1150
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,520
perfect the question is how do we

1151
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,760
is threat modeling the only thing that

1152
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,240
we should do or are other

1153
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,480
solutions like using product management

1154
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,119
to really build out security user

1155
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,400
stories as part of their process um

1156
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,839
i think

1157
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,160
um when looking at kovid we want to use

1158
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,240
a swiss cheese model where we want to

1159
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
wear masks we want social distance we

1160
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,760
want to do all these other things we

1161
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,480
want to vaccinate and same with security

1162
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,520
so if we can get our product managers to

1163
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,160
do the security user stories we threat

1164
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,200
model

1165
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,880
we do bug bounties we have security

1166
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,640
tooling all that

1167
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,000
combined will make sure that our

1168
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,760
products are really really safe so i

1169
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,680
wouldn't say that there are different i

1170
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,200
would say that we will work on those on

1171
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,560
parallel to make sure that we have a

1172
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,480
much more robust life cycle

1173
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,079
great question so

1174
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,160
the question is

1175
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,400
security should still be involved with

1176
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,160
threat modeling especially the more

1177
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,560
sensitive areas how do we

1178
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,839
ensure that engineers are looping us in

1179
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,079
it depends on the sort of situation

1180
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,640
context i know that

1181
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,480
security is involved with a lot of

1182
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
conversations just in general with the

1183
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,280
engineering team um and actually the

1184
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,839
engineering teams

1185
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,280
most engineers want to do the right

1186
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,920
thing um and they will know most

1187
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,119
engineers will actually know the

1188
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,800
processes so they'll know that

1189
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,880
and you can also have

1190
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,200
small little security questions to

1191
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,000
really help you tune that out as well so

1192
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,119
there are a bunch of different

1193
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,040
strategies for that so

1194
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,200
if you're a smaller company where you

1195
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,640
just have uh

1196
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,480
documentation

1197
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,839
engineers will reach out to you they'll

1198
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,079
let you know but at larger companies you

1199
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,000
have a ticketing system make sure that

1200
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,680
they're answering really easy questions

1201
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,119
that will let you know if you need to be

1202
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,040
involved or not i should also note

1203
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
that's a great question in general not

1204
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,599
all teams are at the same place

1205
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,359
so some teams are going to be at the

1206
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,800
training phase other teams are going to

1207
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,960
be at the review phase someone might be

1208
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,040
at the observation phase not all teams

1209
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,880
are alike and you want to make sure that

1210
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,480
you cater it for your teams

1211
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,800
yeah

1212
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,359
yeah that's a great question

1213
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,200
companies big and small when do you want

1214
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,319
to actually push push on that investment

1215
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,520
that's a really good question

1216
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,560
i guess i would say that when some of

1217
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,200
the foundations are already built um so

1218
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,839
that's a hard one

1219
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,680
yeah i would lean on the foundations and

1220
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,560
it has to be the next evolutionary step

1221
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,280
for the organization because

1222
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,599
you have to have the right buy-in from

1223
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,599
management engineering management and

1224
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,599
executive leadership so you you have to

1225
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,520
make sure that it is at the right

1226
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,040
priority level

1227
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,280
it's a really roundabout answer but uh

1228
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,560
yeah you'll know

1229
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,479
yeah

1230
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,078
i'm sorry i can't hear you

1231
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,640
ah

1232
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,560
perfect so the question is how do you

1233
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,480
keep the engineers updated on security

1234
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,760
vulnerabilities

1235
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,359
what we i we don't want

1236
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:38,480
great question

1237
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,640
i want to make sure that we distinguish

1238
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,119
between security vulnerabilities uh as

1239
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,240
well as your systems so secure

1240
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,520
availabilities are always going to come

1241
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,880
third party vulnerabilities you're gonna

1242
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,000
have pen tests and all that sort of

1243
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,920
stuff that's always gonna come you're

1244
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,520
gonna have a workflow for that you

1245
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,119
shouldn't have to worry about it what

1246
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,720
we're really looking at is betting

1247
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,119
security during the design phase let's

1248
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,680
architect these solutions to reduce

1249
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,040
certain type certain classes of

1250
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,119
vulnerabilities just in general so it

1251
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,680
doesn't matter if log for j is out there

1252
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,280
that is going to be a completely

1253
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,359
separate type of

1254
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,520
work than actually looking at your

1255
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,200
system and figuring out how you can

1256
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,520
architect it in a way to reduce certain

1257
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,839
type of vulnerabilities in general so

1258
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,599
separate things but both of them are

1259
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,480
extremely important

1260
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,280
yes yes great okay um the question is

1261
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,200
how did we actually roll out our program

1262
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,160
we did it by team um so

1263
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,200
on the segment side um we focused on

1264
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,960
individual teams i wanted the

1265
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,800
conversations small and intimate i

1266
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,960
wanted people to actually learn my goal

1267
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,400
is to actually teach them so that they

1268
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,560
can learn about security so we rolled it

1269
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,800
out with teams with the last training to

1270
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,599
be on a feature of their own but after a

1271
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,599
certain amount of time

1272
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,200
you've already trained all the teams and

1273
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,480
there's new people coming into the

1274
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,800
company so what we would do in that

1275
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,520
scenario is we would put all these folks

1276
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,440
that are from different teams together

1277
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,760
we train them up and then we would do a

1278
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,359
threat model of one of the systems that

1279
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,040
we have to threatmauld anyways so that

1280
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,880
they get trained up on that

1281
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,839
so a lot of the statuses on which phase

1282
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,000
they're on was based on teams as well so

1283
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,920
i sort of mentioned earlier that some

1284
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,040
folks were in the observation phase and

1285
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,119
some were in the review phase so it's we

1286
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,640
made it mostly team based from that

1287
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,359
respect as well

1288
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,640
that will be a talk for another day eric

1289
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,960
built up a

1290
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,079
way to incentivize folks to really do

1291
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,960
security work so um

1292
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,480
it was our security

1293
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,960
leader point board i think it was

1294
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,880
leaderboard that's right so security

1295
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,760
leaderboard it was fantastic it really

1296
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,760
you saw how folks wanted security points

1297
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,480
so

1298
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,400
finding vulnerabilities writing threat

1299
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,560
models fixing vulnerabilities would give

1300
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,160
them points and there was actually

1301
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,960
competition for being on top it was a

1302
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,119
great program

1303
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,440
yeah

1304
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,520
yes

1305
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,160
perfect the question is is there a

1306
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,640
mechanism to share

1307
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,400
vulnerabilities across the entire

1308
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,000
platform

1309
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,319
so i sort of mentioned that

1310
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,839
self-serve threat modeling won't solve

1311
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,680
all of your problems so those are some

1312
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,839
of the problems that we continue to have

1313
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,280
but if you do build out maybe

1314
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,680
with sharing you might you might want to

1315
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,119
make sure that there's certain

1316
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,119
attributes that you want to label there

1317
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,760
is x accessible abilities or broken

1318
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,079
access controls you can still label

1319
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,920
those attributes to see the type of

1320
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,079
vulnerabilities that either you're

1321
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,520
missed by

1322
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,760
your threat modeling program or things

1323
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,440
that we discovered as part of the threat

1324
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,599
modeling program to sort of know where

1325
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,520
their gaps are as part of the program

1326
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,839
and add more training there but no we

1327
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,440
personally didn't but that's a fantastic

1328
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,319
idea in general yeah

1329
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,680
perfect i think we're good um again feel

1330
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,160
free to hit me up sstm

1331
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,960
segment.com hit me up on twitter i'm

1332
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,040
more than willing to chat more about

1333
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,119
this there's a lot of

1334
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,359
great reasons for doing a program like

1335
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,200
this there's a lot of challenges i want

1336
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,800
you all to know the investment

1337
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,280
beforehand but i don't mind uh walking

1338
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,359
you through how we did it

1339
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,000
in any particular details that you want

1340
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,810
all right thank you all

1341
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:59,949
[Applause]
