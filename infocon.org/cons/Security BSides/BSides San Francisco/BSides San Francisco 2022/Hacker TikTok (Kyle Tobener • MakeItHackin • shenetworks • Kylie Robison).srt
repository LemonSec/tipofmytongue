3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,799
controversy

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,400
so with that we have a moderator over

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,599
today our panelists are going to be kyle

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,720
tobner uh serena aka she networks she's

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,719
on zoom and um make it hackin andrew

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,239
um today we're gonna be talking about

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,399
tik tok and um

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,000
our security professionals and their

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
content that they make on there tik tok

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,280
is best known for being a dancing app as

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,320
you know

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,239
uh animal videos all that

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,320
but they have decided to make security

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
content on there and quite successfully

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,039
so

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,600
we're gonna get into that um

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
without further ado some introductions

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
we'll start with kyle

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,000
different ways that hackers start with

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
serena network let's talk about dhcp

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,720
dhcp is a protocol that allows your

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,119
computer to dynamically receive an iep

34
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,799
address without you having to manually

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,040
enter any information it does this by

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,280
broadcasting requests out to a dhcp

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,840
server and the dhcp server will grab an

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,600
iep address out of its pool and assign

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,080
it to you an attire can continuously ask

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,000
for iep addresses until there's no more

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,840
addresses left in the pool to give out

42
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,040
and this is going to cause a problem

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
because now real people who need

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,880
addresses aren't able to get any and

45
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,240
this is going to cause a denial of

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,400
service this specific attack is called

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,520
dhcp starvation the next attack is dhcp

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,439
spoofing and when your computer is

49
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,920
broadcasting out and asking for an ip

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
address everybody on the network can see

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,079
it so this means anybody can respond to

52
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,720
it

53
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,799
the attacker can sit there and say hey

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
i'm the dhcp server here's an ip address

55
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,840
and you should send all of your traffic

56
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,159
through me i'm the gateway and this is a

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,600
type of man-in-the-middle attack

58
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,640
[Applause]

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,840

um hi so my name is serena um i am

64
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
currently a tester at black hills

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
information security but previously to

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
that i was a network engineer at cisco i

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,920
worked in tac for uh cisco ucs and i was

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,720
on

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,760
a i was a data center uh technical lead

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,040
for

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,840
customer success and yeah i make videos

72
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,760
on tick tock about networking and cyber

73
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,160
security

74
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,800
thank you serena yeah

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,680
right who do we have next

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,200
right make a hacker it's a piece of

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,959
information that you learned that feels

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,319
illegal to know

79
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,080
i studied physics in college and one day

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,840
we learned about faraday cages which are

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,519
metal structures that block radio

82
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
frequency signals and i thought don't

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,319
stores put rfid tags on things that are

84
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,080
expensive and if you walk through the

85
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,120
door

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,360
the alarm goes off well all you got to

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,440
do is use a faraday cage like a piece of

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,200
aluminum foil

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
wrap the foil around the tag

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,560
and now the alarm doesn't go off

91
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
that's uh educational purposes only

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
folks okay

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,640
um i'm andrew make it hack in i was a

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,879
theater major and i also studied physics

95
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,760
too uh army veteran i'm a nerd i drive a

96
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,040
star wars car

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,720
and i love electronics reverse

98
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,920
engineering and i have a cat

99
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,000
thank you andrew

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,680
what's a piece of information that you

101
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,840
like

102
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,518
last but not least

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
tell me you're a hacker without telling

104
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
me you're a hacker

105
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,319
i want to read this new york times

106
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,840
article but i don't want to pay for an

107
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,040
account

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,599
so i go to the url bar

109
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,640
at a period after dot com

110
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,200
and i'm in

111
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,319
educational purposes only

112
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,040
hi i'm i'm kyle tobiner

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
i am a head of security at a software

114
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,238
startup i spent a long time at

115
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,400
salesforce on their security team

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,240
and i try to make educational security

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,040
content on tick tock

118
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,759
thank you kyle

119
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,320
tell me your

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,800
serena

121
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,759
okay

122
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,080
so next we're gonna get into creativity

123
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,960
so

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
i don't think i would have ever expected

125
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,520
security informational videos to be

126
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,040
going viral on tick tock especially

127
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
kyle's i remember watching that or um at

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,400
the

129
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,680
show me you're a hacker without telling

130
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
me you're a hacker would have never

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
expected that but it they blew up

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,440
they're quite viral

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,759
they've been quite creative and i wanted

134
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,880
to know

135
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,080
precisely why tick-tock uh where there's

136
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,520
dancing videos and not necessarily

137
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,080
the great the best place for enterprise

138
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,639
security content uh why tic talk

139
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,520
um so the reason i got started on tik

140
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,759
tok was during the pandemic

141
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,639
and one of my friends got me into it he

142
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,960
was on it back then i think it was more

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
of a dancing app or at least starting to

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,240
change a little bit and he convinced me

145
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,160
to start creating some videos

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,800
and it didn't start off as security

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,080
content i was just kind of posting

148
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,720
random stuff had a chick-fil-a video go

149
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,440
go viral but after that you i kind of

150
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,120
saw the growth and then

151
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,039
eventually made a new account to do the

152
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,280
security content so i like it just

153
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,400
because it's very easy to grow

154
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
get your name out there get your content

155
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,560
out there

156
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
so this is slightly dramatic i apologize

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,319
but last time i was at b-sides about two

158
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,160
years ago presenting i just found out

159
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
two days prior i had cancer it was kind

160
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,120
of a very tough time for me and during

161
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,800
chemo tick tock actually was one of the

162
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
things that made me really happy it's

163
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,400
very easy to use there's silly videos

164
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,000
and so coming out of that whole cancer

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,680
experience i'm all better now but coming

166
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,199
out of that i was like i'm going to make

167
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,560
some videos on tick tock i'm going to

168
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,080
give back a little bit to the thing that

169
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,759
i enjoyed so much and i didn't start

170
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,120
with security content i just started

171
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,800
with stupid nerd stuff

172
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
but i slowly gravitated to security

173
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,000
content and i saw that there was a

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,479
really big appetite especially from like

175
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,319
college and high school students to

176
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,919
learn how to get into this field and so

177
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,000
that i found that really fun to do and a

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
really interesting way to give back

179
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,560
thank you serena i'd love to hear from

180
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,759
you

181
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,639
yeah so very similar um well not quite

182
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,199
as similar to kyle but um

183
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,360
downloading tick tock over the pandemic

184
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,520
and at the time there really wasn't a

185
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,720
lot of

186
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,199
tech creators in general and definitely

187
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,960
not a lot of cyber security or

188
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,199
networking so you had a lot of like

189
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,599
developers i think at the time but

190
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,560
anything else was kind of lacking um and

191
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
so some people you know when we started

192
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,319
posting a lot of us started posting

193
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
around the same time and we're very baby

194
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,680
and you know had some videos go

195
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
um pretty viral and that was great

196
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,759
because it kind of was like oh like

197
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,639
there's an interest for this here and it

198
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,639
kind of pushes you to think a little bit

199
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,280
more creatively and see what you can

200
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,440
really do in 60 seconds

201
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,960
but overall my favorite part of it has

202
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
been like the community and that's why i

203
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,720
continue to do it is because i've just

204
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,759
met so many great people along the way

205
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,840
and have made great friendships and

206
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,039
connections and i i think it was a great

207
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,360
opportunity

208
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,520
thank you serena

209
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,879
so as many don't know it's kind of a

210
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,280
grind to make content on tick tock all

211
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,319
the time has to be pretty consistent um

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,120
and i can't imagine how hard it is to

213
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,879
make consistent security content all the

214
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,960
time um i would love to hear you guys

215
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
thoughts on being security professionals

216
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,759
and having this tick tock gig going how

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,120
does that go for you guys how do you

218
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,599
keep up with the content grind uh

219
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,720
andrew we'd love to hear from you

220
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
i definitely post less now than i did

221
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,280
before um but

222
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
yeah i think

223
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,479
you know for me

224
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,680
uh i i am a big uh fan of creating

225
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,280
things i do a lot of circuit board

226
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,199
projects and other kind of like nerdy

227
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,759
projects so i think just for me i like

228
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,879
creating

229
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,159
and whether that's a video or a project

230
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,880
i get a thrill out of that so

231
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,958
making a video showing off my projects

232
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,320
is just kind of rewarding because i get

233
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,200
to document it i get to share it

234
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,039
but yeah i think

235
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,519
i definitely put probably way too much

236
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,600
effort into creating my videos

237
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,640
um

238
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
then maybe i should

239
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,279
because i don't think it's necessarily

240
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,760
required on tick tock to

241
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,920
you know put a lot of effort into things

242
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,080
you can just kind of record in the app

243
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,519
and and upload it but i usually

244
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,720
edit it off off the app first but

245
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
yeah it's just i like creating things so

246
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,720
i keep doing it

247
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,680
i think i'm very different from you

248
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
andrew and that i try to create my

249
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,680
content as quickly as humanly possible

250
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,040
like the least amount of effort i can

251
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,720
put into it the better

252
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,800
which works for my really busy schedule

253
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,200
and i think early on i was like one a

254
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,800
day or two a day i had to do it had to

255
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,560
do it and then at some point i just was

256
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,000
like you have to give yourself a break

257
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,160
it can be really stressful to to set

258
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
these artificial limits yourself so i

259
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,000
just now i just do it when i want to and

260
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,920
when it makes me happy and i'm a lot

261
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
happier making the content now than i

262
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,440
was before when i had that schedule

263
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,160
yeah i would say

264
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
um the same

265
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,959
as

266
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,760
kyle i i try and

267
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,240
do it as quickly as i can um but i think

268
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,880
for a lot of creators in the beginning

269
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,959
there is a

270
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,800
ton of incentive and it's very exciting

271
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,040
and you come up with all your ideas and

272
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,959
then your ideas become like more and

273
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,320
more sparse

274
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,000
uh i mean this has been at least my

275
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,440
experience has become more and more

276
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,279
sparse as you put everything out because

277
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,760
you're pushing out stuff so quickly

278
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
and so you know for youtube if you think

279
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,079
of youtube a creator might have maybe

280
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,640
one two videos a week that they put a

281
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,320
good amount of effort in but that's

282
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
really only two ideas for tick tock they

283
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,800
want you posting very consistently daily

284
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,600
or multiple times a day so i've had to

285
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,560
completely revamp the way that i have

286
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,880
approached creating content

287
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,440
and um it's worked out for me really

288
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
well just coming up with ideas and kind

289
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,200
of planning things out a little bit

290
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,079
better

291
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,959
um but yeah it's it's it's a grind for

292
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,040
sure

293
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,320
thank you

294
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,959
um on top of keeping it creative keeping

295
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,120
it consistent uh you have to keep it

296
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,000
engaging so with security awareness it

297
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,440
can be hard to keep it engaging

298
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,920
especially for a younger audience 33 of

299
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
tick tock i believe is under 19 if

300
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,120
that's correct

301
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,519
so how do you keep it engaging for such

302
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,640
a young audience

303
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,160
well i think if you make an entertaining

304
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,720
video it's going to appeal to

305
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,959
anyone well maybe not anyone but i think

306
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,880
i think you'll find

307
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
uh depending on your content you'll find

308
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
people of all demographics

309
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,760
tick tock doesn't provide um

310
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,279
analytics on age so i don't know how

311
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,360
many of my followers or her viewers are

312
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,440
in the young category but

313
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,399
yeah i think you just make it

314
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,839
entertaining

315
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,160
maybe stuff relatable

316
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,240
i don't know how close security can get

317
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
that to the to them but

318
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,360
early on in my uh tiktok career if you

319
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,959
want to call it that um

320
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,200
i was doing a lot of security tag videos

321
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
like the one that you saw at the

322
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,079
beginning that was actually just my

323
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,240
first one

324
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,200
that

325
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,040
so a stitch in tick tock is where you

326
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,639
take someone's video

327
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,360
and you add your sort of response to it

328
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,240
so that was a stitch to that girl asking

329
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,440
what's something that feels legal to

330
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,519
know and i was like oh i know a lot of

331
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,279
things that feel illegal to know after

332
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,839
watching a lot of defcon talks and uh so

333
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,320
i did that and then uh just the response

334
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,120
was overwhelming uh so many comments

335
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,360
talking about uh i think the top comment

336
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,120
on that was walmart ain't ready for me

337
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,079
tomorrow and uh so i was like oh yeah i

338
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,519
like security tags i like the physics

339
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,360
behind it so let me just kind of dive

340
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
into it more and um yeah we'll talk

341
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,839
about later why i stopped posting that

342
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,360
kind of content but

343
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
um

344
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,000
yeah i think you just make it engaging

345
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
you want people to comment you want

346
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,160
people to share so yeah

347
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,760
this is actually where tick tock has

348
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,800
influenced my professional life the most

349
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,279
um so the video i shared was like really

350
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,639
quick where i talked about the new york

351
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,959
times and that video went

352
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,440
mega viral like 26 million views is

353
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,639
probably the thing i've done that'll be

354
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,720
seen the most in my entire life but

355
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
there were some weird side effects of

356
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,079
going that that viral and one of them

357
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,320
was my mom saw that video and didn't

358
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,760
know it was me

359
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,279
until later when my sister shared it

360
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,360
with her and was like wait that's my son

361
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,600
but so then we had a conversation she

362
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,839
called me about it and we had the most

363
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,680
lucid conversation about what i do as a

364
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,279
professional that i've ever had with her

365
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,920
she was like so your job is making

366
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,279
things in the browser do things they're

367
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,399
not supposed to i was like yes oh my god

368
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,000
you get it

369
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,120
and so

370
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,279
now when i do things on tiktok or when i

371
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,600
do things for security education at work

372
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,360
i'm trying to make them as simple as

373
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,519
possible because the fact that my mom

374
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,440
who knows very little about the internet

375
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
very little about hackers was able to

376
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,120
connect that dot to me was like

377
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,800
revolutionary and that changed my

378
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,399
thinking about content especially

379
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,000
security content going forward after

380
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
that

381
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,120
yeah um

382
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,120
sorry what was the question again i

383
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,680
haven't answered the correct one

384
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,920
no worries um it's how to keep your

385
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,839
content engaging especially since it's

386
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,000
surrounding security awareness for your

387
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,720
uh

388
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,480
for your audience

389
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,680
yeah i think um i think a lot of people

390
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,440
are more interested in cyber security

391
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,639
than you think

392
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
i think that the way that corporate does

393
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,279
cyber security is

394
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,079
ineffective and boring

395
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,760
and if you think of like a lot of

396
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,000
content that younger people watch it's

397
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
or you would assume younger people watch

398
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,519
which is true but it also appeals to a

399
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,399
much broader age range like how youtube

400
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,880
videos are set up and things like that

401
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,680
um

402
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,000
you know just keeping it interesting and

403
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,839
teaching them something

404
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,800
and letting them them know like the how

405
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,560
behind something so if you think of like

406
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,720
a corporate phishing email it's like

407
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,399
okay this is boring like don't click a

408
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,399
link but if you talk about like what's

409
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,560
happening on the back end

410
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
that's way more interesting because

411
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,800
they're like oh okay cool like

412
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,639
you're learning something aside from

413
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,959
like don't click a sketchy looking link

414
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,600
you know so and another thing that i do

415
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,240
is i just experiment a lot so i try and

416
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,079
create a bunch of different type of

417
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,120
content to see kind of what does really

418
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,839
well what responds what doesn't and then

419
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,320
you know navigate and adjust my videos

420
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,399
from there but you'd always be surprised

421
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,839
a lot of times

422
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,639
um

423
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,720
highly produced videos might not do well

424
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,199
but a video that i say something really

425
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,000
dumb in in 15 seconds does really well

426
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
so it's

427
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,040
it's hard to tell honestly

428
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,399
thank you

429
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,199
so uh on top of keeping it engaging

430
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,920
creative uh you're

431
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
you're posting for a community a

432
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,839
community

433
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,480
um and i wanted to know uh

434
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,519
what about

435
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,279
having that audience on tick tock versus

436
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,320
youtube twitter instagram what drew all

437
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,079
of you to that platform when there were

438
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,920
so many choices out there to build a

439
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,279
community which you all three have

440
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,439
quite

441
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,079
i think tick tock so tick tock's

442
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,000
competitors right now are instagram

443
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,759
reels which came after tick tock and

444
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,600
youtube shorts which just came after

445
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,959
tick tock tick tock came from musically

446
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,880
um i think vine was probably like the

447
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,639
first short form video platform but um

448
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,399
i think just having like a short form

449
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,160
video platform

450
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,839
is appealing to a lot of people

451
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,759
especially to the younger generation

452
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,120
just because you don't have to sit there

453
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,639
for 10 minutes even though i'll sit

454
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,720
there for an hour and scroll through

455
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,800
tick tocks but you don't have to

456
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,399
if you just want to watch one or two

457
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,920
videos

458
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,160
you can you have that choice so i think

459
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,040
that was tick-tock success they were

460
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,720
kind of like the first ones although

461
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
like vine was like six seconds so a

462
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,519
little longer i think you need to engage

463
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,480
people

464
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,759
and their algorithm in terms of like

465
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,560
recommending videos to you is so

466
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,519
good

467
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,680
uh you know after you have to like once

468
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,440
you sign up you just have to like feed

469
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
it a little bit and then it'll just like

470
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,000
start pushing you videos that you never

471
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,160
knew you wanted to watch and

472
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,480
i think that's partly

473
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,679
um how we're able to get to our audience

474
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:08,959
is because

475
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,160
um tick tock has so much data on what

476
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,880
you interact with you know i follow kyle

477
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,119
so like sometimes a video will be

478
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,039
recommended to me and i'll see i'll see

479
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,119
that he commented on it

480
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,839
so

481
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,199
yeah i think their algorithm is just

482
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,720
really good and they're also really good

483
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,079
at just finding your audience for you

484
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,919
i think the social aspect of the video

485
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,840
creation is really fun too where like

486
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,160
andrew makes a prompt i respond to it

487
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,080
and then people ask questions and he can

488
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,760
answer questions i can answer questions

489
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,000
and you can just from like one moment in

490
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,760
time you can make create kind of

491
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,360
hundreds of videos around a bunch of

492
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
different creators and it kind of draws

493
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,360
people in where they're like oh you can

494
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,320
you can go down a rabbit hole and

495
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,520
tick-tock very quickly you're like i

496
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
like this thing let's watch more more

497
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
more more more and suddenly you realize

498
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
oh i want to go into cyber security i

499
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,720
didn't know that but this is amazing and

500
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,799
so i like i hear that feedback a lot

501
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,640
from people who found not just my videos

502
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,400
but sort of the communities videos on

503
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,559
the topic and they're like suddenly very

504
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,240
invested in pursuing that as a career

505
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,039
path which i think is really cool

506
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,320
yeah

507
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,799
mine's i mean i just started using tik

508
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,160
tok like i used other platforms so i

509
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,320
mean i had used instagram i had used

510
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
twitter um i had used facebook right and

511
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,080
so i just started using tiktok

512
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,919
like the way that i would have used

513
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,880
those platforms but in that medium if

514
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,039
that makes sense so obviously being like

515
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,799
in your mid-20s

516
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,160
um you're very online very social media

517
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,480
and so i mean at the time i only had 50

518
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,600
followers on twitter and i had you know

519
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
a couple thousand on instagram and then

520
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,520
i started making tick tocks and and i

521
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
didn't really expect

522
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,720
um

523
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,840
the response that i received

524
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
um but you know sometimes you just find

525
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,400
something that you're good at or that

526
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
resonates with a lot of people and you

527
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,080
just keep pursuing it because it's like

528
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,440
oh this is you know i'm doing something

529
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,679
right this is working and it's great and

530
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,000
i'm having a lot of fun doing it and so

531
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,919
i kind of more just like stumbled upon

532
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,600
it i didn't really

533
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,080
i didn't start take talk as a creator i

534
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
started as more of just like an average

535
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,720
user and then became a creator if that

536
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,240
makes sense

537
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,760
i just want to add something real quick

538
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,799
um

539
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
tiktok definitely has like a culture so

540
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,600
when i was talking about those other

541
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,640
platforms

542
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
i don't know how much of a culture there

543
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,919
is on those platforms but as kyle was

544
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,240
talking about there's like trends so

545
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,480
like you know there might be a they call

546
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,919
them sounds but it's really like the

547
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,000
song that's on a video might be like

548
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,799
going viral for some weird reason but

549
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,080
you can go down the rabbit hole and

550
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,679
seeing everyone do the trends so there's

551
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,080
definitely a culture on tiktok that i

552
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,919
love

553
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,840
thank you guys for your answers

554
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
so you guys have all built up a

555
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,240
community on tiktok and as you mentioned

556
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
before you're

557
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,000
often showing vulnerabilities that they

558
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,520
can exploit

559
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,320
um

560
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,480
to hundreds of thousands of followers

561
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,640
how do you guys go about

562
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,880
showing those vulnerabilities

563
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
and handling showing that to so many

564
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,120
people

565
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,000
it's hard um so

566
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,200
i think we're gonna get to the some of

567
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,520
the moderation stuff later but

568
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,360
i i i did probably months maybe six

569
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,280
months or so of like showing different

570
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,200
security tags and how to exploit them

571
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,640
and that sort of thing

572
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,960
tick tock doesn't really want you to do

573
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,880
that they don't really want you to show

574
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,120
how to exploit something

575
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,320
even though i would have like a

576
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,720
disclaimer on my videos saying you know

577
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,600
educational purposes only um those only

578
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,039
worked so far

579
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,919
um

580
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,559
but some videos were removed

581
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,520
again it's

582
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,600
i kind of thought about it as like lock

583
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,400
picking like lock picking isn't illegal

584
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,679
it's only illegal if you're picking

585
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,600
someone else's lock so if i show you how

586
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,240
to open a security tag like don't use

587
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
that for like malicious purposes but

588
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,559
like if you're interested like me i know

589
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,320
i like to know how things work i like to

590
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,559
reverse engineer i like to find exploits

591
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,159
that sort of thing that's all good don't

592
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,919
do it you don't take money out of

593
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,919
someone else's hand and you know don't

594
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,559
harm a business but you know i think

595
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,880
just because tick tock has billions of

596
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,120
users or whatever it's like they just

597
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,559
are trying to play it on the safe side

598
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,240
and uh they don't want you to do that

599
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,760
kind of thing um

600
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,320
so it's been hard uh i think you can

601
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,039
talk about vulnerabilities without

602
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,640
showing how to do it but i i like to

603
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,120
show how to do it so like i said i got a

604
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,840
lot of videos removed

605
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,919
i think i learned like i've been having

606
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,919
a real struggle with this i mean i'm

607
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,440
sure if you follow me on tick tock or

608
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,400
twitter

609
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,960
um you know that i've had a struggle

610
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,120
with tech talk and removing my videos

611
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,159
like most recently they removed a video

612
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,159
and it's not even just when it comes to

613
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,840
vulnerabilities like they removed a

614
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,240
video that i created on nmap

615
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,480
um which is you know

616
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,200
it's just nmap it's a ip scanning and

617
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,440
and cert you know anyway so i did a

618
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,440
video on nmap and then that was removed

619
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,200
and then there was another video that i

620
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,440
did on password spring where i just

621
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,240
talked about what password spraying was

622
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,880
and like a little fact or a little tip

623
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,520
that you could do to help

624
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,120
detect if there's password spraying in

625
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,880
your environment and that one got

626
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
removed and so

627
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,679
it's

628
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,640
really frustrating because

629
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,039
my idea is like i would like to get to

630
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,720
people who are interested in these

631
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,559
things and i'd like to get into them

632
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,280
early before they seek out

633
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,559
um this type of advice from

634
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,640
you know more of a negative area on the

635
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,440
internet um and get them into a

636
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,000
like a path that can provide them a

637
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,799
great job with great money and um just

638
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,120
by following their interests but in a

639
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,679
positive community right

640
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,760
and so it's definitely very frustrating

641
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,400
i don't show any active exploits i mean

642
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,240
to be completely honest and i'm sure a

643
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,919
lot of people would understand that

644
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,960
showing an exploit fully in 60 seconds

645
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,159
would be

646
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,159
almost impossible depending if you're

647
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,520
just instead of you're just like i'm

648
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,799
going to get this thing off github and

649
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,039
then download it and exploit it that way

650
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,120
um so there's a lot of stuff that goes

651
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,159
on before making the video that i make

652
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,200
that um you don't see so the full

653
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,880
picture really isn't there but you'll

654
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,559
walk away with an understanding of how

655
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,919
it works if that makes sense

656
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,080
that does thank you serena and you were

657
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,960
talking about those positive outcomes of

658
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,480
having such a large community and

659
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,640
interacting with them i imagine almost

660
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,880
daily weekly um do you guys have any

661
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,880
stories of positive outcomes of having

662
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,360
that community success stories people

663
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,480
getting into

664
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,679
security stuff like that

665
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,240
i kind of stumbled my way into content

666
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,320
about job descriptions because people

667
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,840
have been asking me about how to find

668
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,000
entry-level jobs and i went to look for

669
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,400
entry-level jobs and couldn't really

670
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,080
find good ones and sort of it was an

671
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,679
education for me so i started doing a

672
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,320
series breaking down really bad

673
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,840
entry-level jobs and giving people the

674
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
signals of like this is not entry level

675
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,200
ignore this kind of job

676
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,760
and i got a lot of really great positive

677
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,919
feedback from people that it helped

678
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,240
refine their search and so i get really

679
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,919
happy when i get linkedin messages as

680
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,600
like hey i found the job i got my first

681
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,440
cyber security job that's like a little

682
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,039
victory moment for me and they always

683
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,559
make me happy and i've had enough of

684
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,919
them that like that's what keeps me

685
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,360
going making the tick tock content

686
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,720
obviously i got to know kyle through

687
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,559
tick tock it was really awesome seeing

688
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,880
his video go viral and then removed how

689
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,120
long was it down for six days it was

690
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,559
down for six days

691
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,159
i think that during that time it was

692
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,559
probably new york times like scrambling

693
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,400
to fix their vulnerability i don't know

694
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,559
if it's it would be a vulnerability but

695
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,919
yeah how do you remember how long it

696
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,320
took him to fix that it was like two

697
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,559
weeks actually yeah so you could you

698
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,720
used to be able to use that trick uh to

699
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,039
read an article but not anymore thanks

700
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,760
to kyle so yeah it was awesome he had so

701
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,159
many shares on that video the like the

702
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,720
pay well paywall technology got so much

703
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,120
better after that video went viral like

704
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,880
they used to be so full of holes and now

705
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,320
i it kind of pisses me off because i'm

706
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,240
on my ipad and i can't i can't do

707
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
everything i used to do but it actually

708
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,840
did cause a lot of these platforms to

709
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,120
improve their

710
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,039
paywall technology which was interesting

711
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,480
yeah i think part of my favorite thing

712
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,120
about tiktok is like just seeing like

713
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,919
uh that tell me your hacker video uh got

714
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,919
a lot of like people like kyle like

715
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,159
stitching it and kind of

716
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,159
giving their response so i've i've

717
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,679
become like internet friends with a

718
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,640
bunch of people through that

719
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,559
yeah definitely i mean i i've i've done

720
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,559
giveaways and things um i've partnered

721
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,720
with other creators to give away classes

722
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,039
on wireshark and ccna i we i partnered

723
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:48,320
with the duck bill group to give away 10

724
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,559
ccna vouchers for people who are

725
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,640
interested in taking the exam and then

726
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,159
partnered with david bumble to provide

727
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,039
them with all of the courses that they

728
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,120
would need to help pass that exam

729
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,000
so

730
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,159
truly like i really

731
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,559
just keep trying to funnel people in as

732
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,039
much as i can depending and it doesn't

733
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,720
really matter where they are

734
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,600
um

735
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,840
in their journey into tech

736
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,600
but yeah it's been great i mean i

737
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,279
definitely get a lot of dms especially

738
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,000
from women which is fantastic um just

739
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,720
saying that hey like i wasn't sure if i

740
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,480
wanted to go into tech because you hear

741
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,640
so many negative things but you know

742
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,799
watching your content has helped me and

743
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,960
i that is obviously my favorite too

744
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
because i'm just like yeah like welcome

745
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,520
please come

746
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,159
i love that thank you serena

747
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,400
um as you mentioned you get a lot of

748
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,120
messages from women trying to get into

749
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,240
the field uh something we know about

750
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
tick tock it is not without controversy

751
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,320
especially for women and we've talked

752
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,799
about the moderation it's an uphill

753
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,279
battle for you guys so i was wondering

754
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,760
um as content creators

755
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,640
how can we uh discuss the the struggles

756
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,480
you guys have faced individually with

757
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,080
the platform and being content creators

758
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,559
and getting stuff take down taken down

759
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,720
because you're showing vulnerabilities

760
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,080
or whatever it may be

761
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,400
so i think there's a couple thoughts

762
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,480
here one i think you know a lot of the

763
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,159
stuff that i used to post i think is in

764
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,799
the gray area of stuff that used

765
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,799
of things that tick tock wants or

766
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,039
doesn't want on the platform so i've

767
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,880
kind of moved on from showing those

768
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,000
things and i'm okay with that

769
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
i think my

770
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,120
biggest wish is for them to improve

771
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,360
their moderation i think they've

772
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,279
got a good set of community guidelines

773
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,720
and i think all their intentions are

774
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,679
good

775
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,200
but i think you know

776
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,760
anything at scale is a problem in trying

777
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,200
to moderate

778
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,799
millions of videos uploaded

779
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,399
i read the transparency report this

780
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,720
morning i think in the last quarter

781
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,320
there was something like 90 million

782
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,760
videos

783
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,679
that got taken down

784
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,559
and uh i think half of them

785
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,360
were by automated means so and i

786
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,279
remember a transparency report last year

787
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,440
that said i think it was five percent of

788
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,080
those taken down were false positives

789
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,720
and i'm just like oh my god that's

790
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,559
that's how many videos that are like

791
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,240
being taken down that that shouldn't

792
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,440
have been and as a creator uh you know

793
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
you might put a lot of time and effort

794
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,000
into your content and when it gets taken

795
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,159
down it kind of just like hurts a little

796
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,159
bit especially if it's like something

797
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,200
that is innocent so i think there's some

798
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,480
room to grow

799
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
for the moderation to

800
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,840
i don't know if it'd be involving more

801
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,320
humans one of the other thought i had is

802
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,200
you know

803
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,799
some of it's automated some of it's

804
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,799
being reported by users and i think

805
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,960
there's a lot of content being taken off

806
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,559
the platform that should not be on there

807
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,919
whatsoever

808
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,679
but then you have people that just kind

809
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,080
of get targeted uh for whatever reason

810
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,000
and you know you can just report

811
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,240
anyone's video so i don't know what they

812
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,679
have in place to

813
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,360
fight mass reporting or anything like

814
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,600
that but i'm hoping that they get better

815
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,799
at you know trolls uh from reporting

816
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,240
yeah

817
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,320
there's definitely uh people who have

818
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,799
alluded to potentially my videos getting

819
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,080
mass reported and taken down and that is

820
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,480
a possibility for sure and i can't

821
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,880
really say that if that if that's true

822
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,559
or not i don't know

823
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,880
um but i do see this problem with other

824
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,640
content creators in the cyber security

825
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,799
space who are not me so

826
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,559
obviously hopefully they would have some

827
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,279
type of system in place that mass

828
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,360
reporting um

829
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,240
you know

830
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,840
wouldn't cause so much

831
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,159
uh disturbance in my videos i don't know

832
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,120
um

833
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,760
but it seems to me like a lot of things

834
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,559
that

835
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,640
to get taken down are things that show

836
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,880
terminal or command line in my videos

837
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,720
which is super interesting so i'm going

838
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,159
to be experimenting with that for the

839
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,600
next few weeks

840
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,679
um because it just seems that's like

841
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,200
some videos when i'm just explaining

842
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,960
something's fine but the second i bring

843
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,679
up like a terminal it becomes an issue

844
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,360
and it gets taken down so that's just

845
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,679
something interesting that i have kind

846
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,720
of found myself

847
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
but you know a lot of my videos i don't

848
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
think they're in a gray area i think

849
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,399
that they should be out there i'm not

850
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,399
showing things that

851
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,600
um

852
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,919
people shouldn't know i think it helps

853
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,760
people to know those things to better

854
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,080
their cyber security practices even as

855
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,360
just an individual a non-tech person

856
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,640
just to understand some of these

857
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,799
concepts and how these things were

858
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,960
their moderation is very frustrating and

859
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,120
the human component can be interesting

860
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,520
because when you talk about hacking or

861
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,360
hackers it obviously comes with a very

862
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,240
negative connotation for a lot of people

863
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,279
and

864
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,440
it doesn't need to be negative right

865
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,559
because there's a lot of pen testers um

866
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,120
or white hat or whatever

867
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,360
people that are doing hacking for a

868
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,679
positive way to earn money

869
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,760
legally and things like that so you

870
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,320
could get a moderator who just is like

871
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,399
hacking spat no and they they're not

872
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,240
really

873
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,399
digesting the video per se or

874
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,320
understanding the implications so that

875
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,399
can be kind of an interesting

876
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,559
thing to deal with even with a human

877
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,880
moderator is just the

878
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,840
idea of hacking and maybe their bias or

879
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,919
a

880
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:25,760
preconceived idea of hacking

881
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,799
i think i get frustrated with kind of a

882
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,679
different thing which is there i spend a

883
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,159
non-zero amount of time self-moderating

884
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,919
the comments of my videos because there

885
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,120
is a huge part of our community that is

886
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,000
just gatekeeping and that i i get really

887
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,200
frustrated with that because i make a

888
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
video try to make it really simple entry

889
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,640
level for people who might be interested

890
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,039
in the field and in the comments people

891
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,720
start talking down to other people who

892
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,399
are interested in this kind of simple

893
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,799
content and i hate that because we have

894
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,399
such a pipeline problem in cyber

895
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,760
security of getting people into the

896
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,679
field you know there's so many unfilled

897
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,000
jobs and if we have people at the front

898
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,519
lines kind of gatekeeping and turning

899
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,200
people off of the field i find that

900
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
really problematic so it you know it

901
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,880
doesn't violate tick tocks guidelines

902
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,240
but it kind of violates my personal

903
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,080
guidelines so i have to do a lot of

904
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,000
comment deletion and blocking to kind of

905
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,720
try and maintain the positivity and you

906
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,600
know

907
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,840
help people not get discouraged

908
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,039
yeah and one note on top of that kyle um

909
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,320
i think compared to youtube like for

910
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,120
whatever reason take talk you just get a

911
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,200
ton of comments

912
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,440
like base base if you look at a similar

913
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,480
view on youtube to tick talk

914
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,840
um tic toc just has so many comments and

915
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,440
before

916
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,200
the last maybe six months or a year

917
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,840
there was pretty much like no moderation

918
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,640
for

919
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,640
comments on tick tock

920
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,720
and now they've gotten like slightly

921
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,760
better but um the comment section could

922
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,960
probably have its own talk on its own

923
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,760
because it's so chaotic sometimes

924
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,720
thank you guys so uh you guys are all

925
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,960
security professionals um it's not

926
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
without its challenges and you have to

927
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,559
turn out content all the time keep it

928
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,600
engaging

929
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,279
why do you continue to do this what's

930
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,880
the upside especially as you guys are

931
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,320
all established professionals in this

932
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,639
field

933
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,679
um like i said before earlier i just

934
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,840
like creating things and

935
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,440
my day job has nothing to do with what i

936
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,200
post on tick tock so

937
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,840
i um

938
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,120
i always have another project kind of

939
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,519
going on so i'm always

940
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,880
i always have something to post about

941
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,679
i think i enjoy kind of the ancillary

942
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,399
opportunities that it opens up

943
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,720
um like i met you because of my tic toc

944
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,159
posting uh

945
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,840
nist reached out to me which i thought

946
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840
was really fun to say you know we really

947
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,519
enjoy your content we can't say publicly

948
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,880
we enjoy your content because you use

949
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,720
tik-tok and that's a problem for us but

950
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,159
keep going and here's some resources we

951
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,000
might want you to talk about maybe and

952
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,200
so like stuff like that is really

953
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,679
interesting to me where it's like tiktok

954
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,000
is really good at building a big

955
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
audience that a lot of the platforms

956
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,600
other platforms struggle to reach like

957
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,560
really young people and so i think tick

958
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,079
tock is really unique and so that's why

959
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,679
i kind of just focus on like i have no

960
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,960
real interest in youtube or other

961
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,480
platforms i just enjoy tick tock it's

962
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,879
really fun

963
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,079
yeah and i really enjoy the interactions

964
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,599
that i have with people for the most

965
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,960
part i mean obviously there are some

966
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,839
negative but overall the people that i

967
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,960
meet through doing it and i get to learn

968
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,320
a lot while doing it myself

969
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,599
overall i think there's just so much

970
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,280
more benefit for me to do it and i enjoy

971
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,000
it

972
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,879
so

973
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,320
luckily it's it works out well when you

974
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,239
love doing the thing that

975
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,839
brings you a lot of other benefits

976
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,440
thank you serena

977
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,839
so uh for people who might be in the

978
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,918
audience looking to do the same

979
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,800
uh make videos on security content what

980
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,400
is your guys's advice for getting

981
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,040
started and navigating

982
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,240
all of the things you guys have

983
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,800
discussed today

984
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,560
who is on tick tock raise your hand

985
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,640
watches your videos

986
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,680
oh cool

987
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,160
yeah i wish there were more hands up um

988
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,520
but yeah i i think you know

989
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,200
there's there's people who are just on

990
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,880
the platform to

991
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,599
to watch and that's perfectly fine um

992
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,599
but uh my advice is if you think

993
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,359
you have something interesting to say or

994
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,160
show

995
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,079
go ahead and like make a video i totally

996
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,320
understand with this crowd if you don't

997
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,440
want to put

998
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,960
something else on the internet i totally

999
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,359
get that but um

1000
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,599
if you have a fun hobby i watched a

1001
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,079
video the other day it was someone

1002
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,400
scraping beeswax

1003
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,960
off of i don't know what you call that

1004
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,680
but honeycomb just scraping the wax off

1005
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,520
of it and it was like i was like i can't

1006
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,040
believe i'm watching this and i watched

1007
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,800
the whole thing and then like it was

1008
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,240
just it was a viral video like for

1009
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,079
understandable reasons it was just like

1010
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,320
looked really awesome so i think tick

1011
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,800
tock is uh also a good platform because

1012
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,000
there's just

1013
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,400
so much exposure to the things that you

1014
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,960
never get to see in your life uh there's

1015
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
a guy i don't know i think he's from

1016
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,440
some south american country but he was

1017
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,800
like weaving

1018
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,280
blankets on a live and it was just

1019
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,960
thousands of people in this live like

1020
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,880
watching this guy weave blankets and

1021
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,400
there's so much out there so if you

1022
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,200
think you have anything interesting um

1023
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,160
to show post it and and even if you

1024
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,599
don't think it's interesting someone

1025
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,440
else might so maybe it's something like

1026
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,200
routine that you do

1027
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,040
but if i would also say if you're very

1028
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,800
passionate about what you're doing i

1029
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,400
think that helps kind of like deliver

1030
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,160
your message like hey i really find this

1031
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,520
interesting um yeah

1032
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,040
i think also

1033
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,160
tick-tock makes you a better

1034
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,320
communicator because the out the way the

1035
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,599
algorithm works with the platform it's

1036
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,520
very honest about like did people watch

1037
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,200
your video or not how long did they stay

1038
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,040
interested did they comment did they

1039
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,480
share it with a friend

1040
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,320
and so you start to realize like the way

1041
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,760
you might be speaking and the way you

1042
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,680
might be communicating may not hold

1043
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,920
people's attention and as you get better

1044
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,440
you start to realize oh there's ways

1045
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,720
that i can be more interesting more

1046
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
captivating tell a better story and so

1047
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,800
that translates directly into my day job

1048
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,320
and there's a bunch of accounts i follow

1049
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,079
on tick tock that have nothing to do

1050
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,839
with what i'm interested in they're like

1051
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,000
22 year olds who are in college but i

1052
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,839
think their presentation style is so

1053
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,440
much better than mine that i watch

1054
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,960
everything they do because i'm learning

1055
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,720
a ton from how they communicate to the

1056
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,720
world and i i just love that

1057
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,280
yeah i agree both those are great points

1058
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,359
um there's two there's people that

1059
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,320
follow me there's one person who is a

1060
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,440
pilot for a major airline and he follows

1061
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,720
my content i follow his content and i've

1062
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,880
never flown a plane but you know it's

1063
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,720
just interesting to learn about some of

1064
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,880
the aviation stuff and the way that he

1065
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,680
presents it i'm like wow this is cool so

1066
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,359
definitely love to see other people's

1067
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,599
style in presenting really interesting

1068
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,599
things i mean there are accounts on tick

1069
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,359
tock that'll have like

1070
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,960
i think i came across an account a

1071
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,560
cleaning account and all this account

1072
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,960
does is does like house cleaning

1073
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,200
and they have like 5 million followers

1074
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,960
because some people are just like oh

1075
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,280
learning cleaning tips for your home or

1076
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,520
just it's satisfying watching something

1077
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,920
that's like super messy be really clean

1078
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,560
and see the potential in a space so

1079
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,480
like whatever you're passionate about in

1080
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,839
your hobby

1081
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,320
just post it there um there's another

1082
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,480
cyber security creator his name's crypto

1083
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,000
the llama and he got i think almost like

1084
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,079
400 000 followers and he never showed

1085
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,680
his face in a video

1086
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,839
so that's another way too if you're not

1087
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,839
interested being you know front and

1088
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,760
center in front of a camera i get that

1089
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
there's been times where i've stopped

1090
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,280
posting for a while just because i just

1091
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,359
didn't want to be on camera

1092
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,560
um

1093
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,280
there's a ways around that too so it's

1094
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,599
really up to you and

1095
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,440
you know just keep posting if you're

1096
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,680
interested in it and whatever you decide

1097
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,200
really

1098
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,720
krypto does have his picture when his

1099
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,079
profile picture which is funny though

1100
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,680
because yeah he never shows his face

1101
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,440
except his profile picture

1102
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,280
yeah i would also just say it's really

1103
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,359
really easy to get started with tick

1104
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,200
tock content like i've never used

1105
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,119
anything else except my phone i use the

1106
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,200
editor in the app i use my phone to take

1107
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,480
all the videos

1108
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,240
i don't invest a lot of energy into it

1109
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,079
and i've been very successful and it's

1110
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,839
like you can get started for no money at

1111
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,520
all yeah agreed

1112
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,720
thank you guys

1113
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,839
so we're about to wrap up um

1114
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,480
i just wanted to open up to q a

1115
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,599
discussing everything we've talked to

1116
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,079
our creators about today the controversy

1117
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,320
the community the creativity uh if

1118
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,599
anyone has any questions

1119
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,760
and uh we sent a link on twitter with

1120
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,920
that slide do thing do do you know if we

1121
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,000
have anyone moderating that

1122
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,400
because i hope so

1123
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,320
hi

1124
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,520
i'm jackie

1125
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,079
uh so i've been tracking advanced like

1126
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,760
nation state actors for the past 10

1127
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,480
years and so it just really makes me

1128
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,040
wonder what you're thinking about

1129
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,599
when you use a platform that is in part

1130
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,240
owned by the chinese government

1131
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,920
as security professionals sorry it's the

1132
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,240
elephant in the room

1133
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,160
i mean um the americans should make a

1134
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,000
better platform the platform's awesome

1135
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,760
right

1136
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,440
it's great so

1137
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,400
i did a um final paper for my master's

1138
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,440
program on tick tock and

1139
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,040
kind of

1140
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,760
the controversy around

1141
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,680
the chinese government and it owning

1142
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,839
tick tock as a platform

1143
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:44,880
and

1144
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,119
honestly a lot of it

1145
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,000
was a political campaign

1146
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,240
um there was a lot of money spent on

1147
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,599
anti-tick tock

1148
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,319
uh rhetoric and campaigns and ads and

1149
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,640
content i mean we're talking like

1150
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,720
hundreds and thousands of dollars spent

1151
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,200
from political campaigns on anti-tick

1152
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,880
talk ads

1153
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,440
i think this is this started happening

1154
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,319
coincidentally around when tick-tock

1155
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,359
took uber's place as the number one

1156
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,560
startup

1157
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,079
and

1158
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,680
i think you know if you look at tick

1159
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,240
tock itself they have done so much and i

1160
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,839
am so critical of them like if you

1161
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,599
follow me on twitter you know i'm very

1162
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,560
critical of them but i do want to you

1163
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,240
know correct information or

1164
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,760
misconceptions because they're so

1165
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,079
transparent now i mean tick tock is not

1166
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,400
available as an application in china

1167
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,480
none of tick tock servers are in china

1168
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,560
all of them are based in the us

1169
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,319
um or singapore

1170
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:43,520
and

1171
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,640
there's a headquarters in the u.s they

1172
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,319
show they have their source code

1173
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,560
available for you to check out yourself

1174
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,160
if you're interested they publish your

1175
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,240
transparency reports

1176
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,720
um i personally as a cyber security

1177
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,079
person and if we're talking about risk

1178
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,359
i'm less concerned with tick-tock and

1179
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,119
more concerned with like our power

1180
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,040
plants if we're really gonna get into

1181
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,920
the conversation of security and

1182
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
um nation-state actors

1183
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,960
but

1184
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,760
that's just me i i've done

1185
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,599
a decent amount of research on it mainly

1186
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,920
because i had the same question and kind

1187
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
of came up with like all right this

1188
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,920
seems like there's some

1189
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,200
other motivations happening here um with

1190
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,280
just people disliking

1191
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,680
china and the government of china and

1192
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,160
not being very happy that they had a

1193
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,520
successful

1194
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,839
startup in america basically

1195
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,119
got a question over here

1196
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,200
yeah it sounds like you have some

1197
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,119
understanding of who watches your videos

1198
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,280
through kind of anecdotal experiences

1199
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,680
comments stuff like that people say hey

1200
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,040
it helped me out

1201
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,200
but i'm wondering um does tic toc like

1202
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,960
twitter or youtube have any kind of

1203
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,319
analytical tools that help you

1204
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,160
understand who's watching your videos

1205
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,760
who the audience is

1206
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
even you know like maybe you post a

1207
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,960
video and

1208
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,319
people drop out in the first four

1209
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,800
seconds that that kind of thing like

1210
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,800
how deep into the weeds can you get with

1211
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,720
like demographics and how people watch

1212
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,520
your content and consume it

1213
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,960
they're definitely getting better uh

1214
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,800
there's a new release i don't have it

1215
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,560
yet but it's it's kind of got like the

1216
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,319
youtube analytics where you can see drop

1217
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,480
off like when that happens

1218
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,240
so they just started pushing that out do

1219
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,640
you know if you have that yet

1220
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,839
i can see

1221
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,800
uh

1222
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,200
male versus female like percentage-wise

1223
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,880
mine's about 70 30 70 male 30 female

1224
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,319
which is interesting because when you

1225
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,240
sign up for tick tock you never put your

1226
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,400
gender in there so

1227
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,079
how are they

1228
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,920
how are they assigning your gender

1229
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,680
that's very interesting to know we don't

1230
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,960
know age

1231
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,800
although if you do have a tick doc

1232
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,119
business account or you sign up for ads

1233
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,319
or something

1234
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,400
you can see that information because

1235
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,640
you're trying to target

1236
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,520
certain

1237
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,560
ages

1238
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,319
you get to see your country

1239
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,880
or where your people are from

1240
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,520
i'm only about 60 u.s which is very

1241
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,720
weird

1242
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,160
but

1243
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,560
some videos kind of get pushed out to

1244
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,520
to other countries

1245
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,960
that's kind of like the basic

1246
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,480
information you can see average watch

1247
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,400
time the percentage of people who watch

1248
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,160
the full video

1249
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,200
but they are getting better at their

1250
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,759
analytics

1251
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,560
great other questions from the group

1252
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,560
here

1253
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,760
okay

1254
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,400
well um

1255
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,319
closing house back to you

1256
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,400
question for you

1257
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,720
you write a lot about tick tock i've

1258
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,119
noticed that what got you interested in

1259
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,400
tick tock because you're not a you're

1260
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,000
not a content creator but you you tend

1261
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,280
to write about it

1262
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,640
well i didn't expect a question for

1263
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,599
myself

1264
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,040
um

1265
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,520
yeah i don't know i'm interested in

1266
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,920
technology i majored in information

1267
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,000
systems and i became a journalist after

1268
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,839
college because i liked writing more

1269
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,920
about technology than uh creating

1270
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,040
technology

1271
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,720
um

1272
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,480
tick-tock is a formidable platform i

1273
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,040
used to not take it seriously and i was

1274
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,040
in college not that long ago it was you

1275
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:19,760
know

1276
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
a platform for people my age i did not

1277
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,520
take it seriously i thought

1278
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,200
uh it's for people who are even younger

1279
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,040
than me

1280
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,200
but once i got into it um my mentor

1281
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,400
actually she was like you need to start

1282
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,920
making tick tocks now and i was like i'm

1283
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,520
never gonna do that

1284
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,760
um but she was right people were blowing

1285
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,160
up as you guys all did um

1286
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,640
not really expecting to it's it's a very

1287
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,079
formidable platform and i don't think

1288
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,599
it's gonna go away any time soon i think

1289
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,520
it's only gonna get stronger and not

1290
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,520
only that the people i've written about

1291
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,200
on tiktok and why i met kyle was because

1292
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,040
my editor

1293
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,960
tick tocks was like wow look at this

1294
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,319
look at what they're creating and look

1295
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,119
at everyone's responses

1296
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,800
so i thought that was interesting these

1297
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,880
people who are blowing up on tick tock

1298
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,400
and then the comments

1299
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,240
of people who are my age and younger

1300
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,319
like wow i learned a lot from this can

1301
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,319
you tell me more and um

1302
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,640
people engaging with it uh

1303
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,280
i think it's only gonna get bigger from

1304
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,640
here and i think we're gonna see more

1305
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,760
creators

1306
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,480
who are you know security uh

1307
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,240
professionals

1308
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,560
uh maybe ceos that would be funny i

1309
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,079
think it's just gonna get bigger so

1310
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,319
that's why i chose to write about tik

1311
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,079
tok and people like kyle

1312
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,680
thank you guys oh we see another

1313
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,240
question in the crowd

1314
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,359
thank you

1315
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,680
uh so with tick tock content you have

1316
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,920
the inherent limit of like 10 10 minute

1317
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,160
videos right now and you miss some of

1318
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,400
the context around like a blog where you

1319
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,240
can technically detail something for

1320
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,240
security or a screen share from your pc

1321
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,839
where you can show kind of hacker tools

1322
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,160
or infosec tools what are strategies you

1323
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,200
guys use

1324
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,040
to build the content but still be very

1325
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,040
technical

1326
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,800
i think the limitations are actually a

1327
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,960
strength and i've never created a video

1328
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,880
over a minute and i never will like i

1329
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,280
like the one minute limitation

1330
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,200
uh and so some of my more technical

1331
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,240
videos i'll take a a bug bounty report

1332
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,000
from like you know a transparent hacker

1333
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,839
one report and i'll break that down for

1334
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,440
people like here's how the attacks work

1335
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,880
here's how they found the bug here's

1336
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,880
what it means and you can actually you

1337
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,119
know with with crisp editing you can

1338
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,960
explain a lot of technical details in a

1339
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,960
minute i think it's actually a really

1340
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,000
good exercise to see how you can be more

1341
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,240
simple

1342
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,319
i just want to add that uh one thing to

1343
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,480
remember about tick tock is

1344
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,559
usually people aren't searching for

1345
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,800
content on tick tock you're not you know

1346
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,160
you might go to youtube and you're like

1347
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,960
how to use nmap right but you're not

1348
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,040
doing that on tick tock so you also kind

1349
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,800
of have to like come up from a point of

1350
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,280
view where this the people aren't really

1351
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,559
searching for this content they're just

1352
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,559
getting it delivered to them so i think

1353
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,480
depending on the content you maybe

1354
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,079
there's some content that doesn't belong

1355
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,359
on tiktok like if it's a tutorial um it

1356
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,040
might not have the biggest reach where

1357
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,640
it would like on youtube where people

1358
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,960
are searching for that sort of thing

1359
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,680
and then i also just kind of think that

1360
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,680
you know there's i think there's a time

1361
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,400
limit for just on what type of video you

1362
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,720
want to make like um one of the recent

1363
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,720
projects i did was hacking harry potter

1364
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,440
wands and someone wanted to

1365
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,319
get a tutorial on how i did

1366
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,240
uh one of them and i was like oh man i

1367
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,000
don't think i was gonna do very well but

1368
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,240
it's like a four minute video and it's

1369
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,319
it's doing pretty good so i think if you

1370
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,240
kind of structure it right um and if

1371
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,599
it's appropriate for tick tock you don't

1372
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,000
have to like worry about is this what

1373
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,040
something's searching for then it'll be

1374
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,800
okay

1375
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,440
cool thank you

1376
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,920
all right oh we got a question

1377
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,920
i really love this active audience here

1378
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,800
this is good stuff

1379
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,599
hi um i have a question around

1380
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,920
being a security kind of informer

1381
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,559
educator versus an influencer it sounds

1382
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,680
like the three of you create a lot of

1383
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,040
educational

1384
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,119
content which is amazing we need more

1385
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,800
people in the security space

1386
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,770
do you foresee yourself trying to

1387
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,079
[Music]

1388
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,160
become like more of an influencer trying

1389
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,520
to influence security trends trying to

1390
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,920
influence better security posture

1391
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,000
using kind of your platform in that

1392
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,119
direction is that something you've

1393
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,480
considered or

1394
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,520
see anyone trying to go in that

1395
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,119
direction i get

1396
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,760
contacted occasionally for sponsored

1397
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,680
content and i tend to just ignore it all

1398
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,079
like i have a job that i really enjoy

1399
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,920
and that's where i make my money so i

1400
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,119
don't do

1401
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,280
tick-tock to to make money or to be an

1402
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,520
influencer and i kind of don't intend to

1403
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,200
and i'm happy with that because i think

1404
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,880
it lets me keep my content really clean

1405
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,040
like i decide what i talk about and

1406
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,800
don't have to take edits from anybody

1407
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,960
else

1408
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,440
yeah

1409
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,839
i i do take sponsorship so i'm a little

1410
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,800
bit different but i'm very very picky on

1411
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,200
the sponsorships that i take so i've

1412
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,400
worked with

1413
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,839
um like esa and nvidia aws

1414
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:28,400
um all companies that i am familiar with

1415
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,079
and have used

1416
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,640
and can attest to just as a person

1417
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,760
because

1418
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,720
again we are all professionals too so i

1419
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,319
don't want to put my name on something

1420
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,640
that would discredit me

1421
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,200
um or make me look bad i'm not

1422
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,520
using take talk to make money um but it

1423
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,040
definitely is somebody who also had

1424
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,280
recently graduated college and has some

1425
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,640
student loan debt i'm like all right

1426
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,839
cool i'll take definitely a few

1427
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,559
sponsorships um to help with that and

1428
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,240
also kind of

1429
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,280
i don't know i don't want to say it

1430
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,359
motivates me to make content but it's

1431
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,839
like okay you know like if anything goes

1432
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,000
wrong if i lose my job it is another way

1433
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,160
that i could potentially at least pay

1434
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,640
some bills if needed luckily it hasn't

1435
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,800
come to that but um

1436
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,319
has helped me pay down my student loans

1437
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,160
so i'm very grateful

1438
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,960
for that as far as being an influencer

1439
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,400
um i'm not entirely sure like

1440
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,640
ultimately i think that word just means

1441
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,400
different things for different people

1442
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,040
like what i do sign contracts uh

1443
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,880
sponsorship contracts there are

1444
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,520
influence or contracts a lot of the time

1445
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,280
um it'll say that or something like

1446
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,559
similar to that

1447
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,480
um i'm here to make like educational

1448
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,079
videos and talk about security stuff um

1449
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,000
my idea of influencing is just

1450
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,400
influencing people into the field

1451
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,760
so that's hopefully what i'm doing

1452
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,800
excellent all right well we are out of

1453
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,839
time

1454
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:54,800
um

1455
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,520
thank you very much uh

1456
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,280

1457
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,640

1458
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,960

1459
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,839
