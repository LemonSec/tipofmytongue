hiring managers in my network

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,960
hiring and retaining security talent is

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,320
by far one of the most challenging parts

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,480
of their day job

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,240
on top of this niche skill set we find

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,519
ourselves one of the most competitive

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,679
markets we've seen in many years

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,000
and twins with the great resignation and

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,920
mass layoffs more recently it's becoming

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,760
more and increasingly challenging to

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,640
hire and retain top talent

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,760

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,760

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,360

23

12 years of my career helping companies

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,680
to build technical teams and the last

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,360
four years

26
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,440
working on security hires with a lot of

27
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,000
these companies at the table today

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,480
we've got an incredible panel um today

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,640
of season security executives and

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,559
leaders that i'll introduce in a second

31
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,720
um and we're going to explore hiring and

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,640
culture and how to kind of hire and

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,000
retain talent

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,439
uh before we get going is there any

35
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,360
hiring managers in the room

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,040
anyone's hide in the last six or twelve

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,400
months

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,920
yeah keep your hands up if you find it

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,200
relatively easy to hide during this

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,799
period

41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,159
there's no hands up in the room

42
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,840
oh okay find it easy over there nice

43
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,119
we'll come back to you

44
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,360
we'll make sure we'll come back to you

45
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,720
yeah because they think i'm an expert

46
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,119
and i'm not so

47
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,119
good

48
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,360
well um these these folks around me who

49
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,280
are introducing in a second may have not

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,040
completed it but they've done a pretty

51
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,920
incredible job of hiring retaining and

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
scaling security teams

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,159
today we'll be exploring how

54
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,000
these folks have approached it and

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,759
approach talent attraction in general

56
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,759
and they'll be sharing some of the wins

57
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,280
challenges

58
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,040
that they'll face when building teams so

59
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560

60

fortunate to have in front of us today

113
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,920
so

114
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,959
i've had

115
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,640
so many kind of questions thrown my way

116
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,040
which will kind of start um it's really

117
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,879
nice to see that the two keynote

118
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,640
speakers which by the way were

119
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,879
incredible both asla who maybe in the

120
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,280
room and jackie yesterday

121
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,239
a golden thread of their talks was

122
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,080
bridging the cyber security talent gap

123
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,480
and building culture of cyber security

124
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
and building a great culture within

125
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,319
these companies so i think we'll find

126
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,840
some interesting conversations today

127
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,599
coming from here so the first question

128
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,600
that i did have come through and and

129
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,199
thurman we'll start with you if you

130
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,720
wanna answer this one when the questions

131
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
came through what are the key factors

132
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,400
and considerations that you have when

133
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,160
you're looking to build a security team

134
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,240
from from scratch

135
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,160
that's a great question um i mean the

136
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,520
first thing that i

137
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
i look i mean let me tell you what i did

138
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,840
when i arrived at data rigs and this is

139
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,320
a story that some of you um i i'm

140
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,840
looking at travis that he knows his

141
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,720
story

142
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,240
the first thing is you do an assessment

143
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,759
what is what is the

144
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,440
what are the needs from the company what

145
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,520
is the the current tools you know uh

146
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,680
budget the engineers that you have and

147
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,360
and i usually do four things the first

148
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,160
one is what is your strategy in in the

149
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,360
security field it's like how are you

150
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
going to outpace the attackers right uh

151
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,560
the second thing that you do is like

152
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
what is your security organization that

153
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
is going to you know help uh fulfill the

154
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,840
strategy the third thing is like okay

155
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,680
what are the leaders and the that they

156
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
are going to help you to build that uh

157
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,759
that organization and finally you know

158
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,520
you building that organization from an

159
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,080
ic level and execution right so um

160
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,639
essentially is going back to

161
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,880
the the the company that you are in what

162
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,600
are the needs what are the tools and

163
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
bridge the gap between these two things

164
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,400
right and the first thing that you need

165
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,240
to do is like do i have the tools that i

166
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,639
that i need and if not you know i always

167
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,320
say this thing is like during my first

168
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,800
six months at databricks i was not a cso

169
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,840
i was a recruiter

170
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
essentially right it's like uh uh

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,800
sourcing you know convincing people

172
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,120
building culture for uh the existing

173
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,960
people assisting with people to

174
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,800
to to persist in the company through the

175
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
changes that we're going you know super

176
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,960
super important to to bridge the gap

177
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,479
between where you want to go where you

178
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,720
are always be recruiting always be

179
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,479
recruiting always be recruiting

180
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,319
you want to go come back

181
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,240
yeah i think that's been a goal of going

182
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,639
through our professional relationship is

183
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,639
you never you're never offline caleb

184
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
with with hiring same question to you

185
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,039
when you come into organizations i know

186
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,440
you've worked on startups and now large

187
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,479
enterprise customers like robin hood

188
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,759
how do you approach that how do you

189
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,360
approach it starting from security

190
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,199
hiring from scratch

191
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,919
so yeah this is a very complex question

192
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,400
um and i think really

193
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,720
there's a lot of context that has to be

194
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,479
taken into account i think going off of

195
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,720
what firm said like what stage of

196
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,400
company are you what type of business

197
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,319
are you when what's your threat model

198
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,319
what where is the existing team where

199
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,479
are the gaps in those teams what are the

200
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,000
leadership look like there's so much

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,720
context in terms of i think who you

202
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,360
choose to hire so what i'm going to do a

203
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,720
little bit of is i'm going to kind of

204
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,560
skip over some of the strategy of who

205
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,759
you choose because i think it can be

206
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,680
very very context

207
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
driven is maybe talk a little bit about

208
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,840
maybe how i hire because i think that

209
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,639
can be just generic across the board

210
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,840
um and so when i think about how i hire

211
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
you know i i do agree with from

212
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,800
especially when you walk in and you're

213
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,960
building a team you are

214
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
dedicated to recruiting you have to

215
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,479
understand i think you have to take this

216
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,120
context that people are number one

217
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,880
talent is number one

218
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,800
and you cannot do anything without

219
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,440
hiring that talent and so you have to

220
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,520
have that in your mindset you have to

221
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,840
have you have to inflict that into your

222
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,160
team and to the people around you that

223
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,560
people is number one and how do i hire

224
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,520
so that you start really focusing on

225
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,440
what is the hiring process what's the

226
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,960
recruiting process how do i choose

227
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,520
what things to deal with and let burn

228
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,479
versus

229
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,240
focusing on the people and the

230
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,319
interviewing

231
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,400
that's a really really tough part so i

232
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,960
think when i first came in that was one

233
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,120
of the big things is instill a culture

234
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,919
of

235
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,080
interviewing people and candidates being

236
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,560
number one what's the process how do i

237
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,840
make that as efficient as possible

238
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,160
and make sure that we do the right thing

239
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,599
and focus on hiring and how to hire

240
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,560
and i think that in doing that you have

241
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
to make this decision because i think

242
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,319
what the hardest part is

243
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,639
hey i've got 50 fires that i've got to

244
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,560
go deal with

245
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,360
or i go focus on hiring and at the end

246
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,160
of the day hiring is kind of treated as

247
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,520
this you know you know manage the corral

248
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,000
of herd of sheep coming in and people

249
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,320
and it's just a process right like it's

250
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,599
a process

251
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,360
when that's you have to look at this and

252
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,120
say like these fires

253
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,039
if i don't get the right people and look

254
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,640
at this not just being a process and

255
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,320
about herding cattle this is an

256
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,680
important critical piece of what we do

257
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
you get these people the faster you get

258
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,600
good quality talent in the faster these

259
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
fires go away so you have to say these

260
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
fires are going to burn for now and i'm

261
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,800
going to go focus on this stuff around

262
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
making sure that the hiring process is

263
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
just not considered a process it's

264
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,160
something you invest in it's something

265
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,920
you care about it's something that is

266
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,080
the core part and how do i instill that

267
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,680
into the teams and the culture of the

268
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,000
company i think is important yeah

269
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,360
great answer thank you

270
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,880
um jessica

271
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,519
to kind of dovetail into another

272
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,080
question that's come up is

273
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,920
building these teams yeah and moving

274
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,000
quickly and as caleb says kind of

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,800
choosing to kind of let fires burn

276
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,720
to sacrifice making these investments in

277
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,640
highers that can then eventually put out

278
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
the fires um

279
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,160
in such a competitive market right now

280
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,720
that we see ourselves in how can you how

281
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,360
do you get the edge over the com

282
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
other companies that are hiring for the

283
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,360
same skill set um and able to build a

284
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
team of top security talent

285
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,160
yeah i think that there's um there's a

286
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,279
couple different

287
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
things that that we have to look at and

288
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
you know on the on the tactical side i

289
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,440
think you know kind of echo with what uh

290
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
caleb furman said you know when you look

291
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,880
at your strategy

292
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
that kind of sets the

293
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,480
direction the north star of where you

294
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,399
want to go from a hiring perspective

295
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,240
but i think the yeah the first thing i

296
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
always look at is having very close

297
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,000
relationships with my hr business

298
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,480
partner folks because they are going to

299
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,760
help me with looking at things like

300
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
paybands and how is comp

301
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,399
benchmarked uh because in a lot of cases

302
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,839
comp is benchmarked against i.t

303
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,440
positions and we all know that security

304
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,200
positions cost more than i.t positions

305
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
and so so you can go and get all these

306
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,120
great candidates but then you're running

307
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,360
into roadblocks trying to get them all

308
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,920
on board it um so you know i definitely

309
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,839
think starting with looking at kind of

310
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,320
the fundamentals of what you have what

311
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,560
are the factors and metrics that you use

312
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,600
to determine headcount ratios for me

313
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,720
appsec ratio appsec engineer ratio to

314
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,800
developer right there's that's a metric

315
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,839
um trust we deal with a lot of business

316
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,680
customers that you know we have a whole

317
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,760
team called trust services that handles

318
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,440
all of our customer requests and we need

319
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,279
to benchmark how many sales people and

320
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,000
how many customers and to you know right

321
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,079
size and help understand how many people

322
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,160
we need to support the to support the

323
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,720
mission i think that um

324
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,240
in the overall um

325
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,800
you know hiring good uh

326
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
good talent um

327
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,760
you know

328
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,160
most of the people i i feel like the

329
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,760
really great talent that i've have have

330
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,680
i either been um

331
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,680
you know uh connections um from the past

332
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,480
or

333
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
having my uh my folks tap into their to

334
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
into their connections we found

335
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,560
a lot of some of my best hires have been

336
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,640
very kind of just random and then they

337
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
happen and it's like two weeks later

338
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,760
you're getting this person an offer and

339
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,880
they've been at

340
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,640
boeing for 25 years and they really

341
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
thought about leaving until you talked

342
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
with them right and so i would say

343
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,560
there's a definitely a lot of kind of

344
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,160
uh having to sort of mine through the uh

345
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,079
the large um

346
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,720
you know the very large looking

347
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,959
uh or maybe the scary dearth of of

348
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,040
candidates and then you know being able

349
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,519
to find out find those kind of those

350
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,880
diamond of the rough folks that you can

351
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,920
kind of pull up we also do a lot of uh

352
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,160
internal you know recruiting right so

353
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,320
some of my best abstract people are

354
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,120
former qa folks some of my best you know

355
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,920
uh

356
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,839
you know folks in my security

357
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,160
engineering team came from you know and

358
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,320
services support and you know so looking

359
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,160
for the looking at those folks and then

360
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,320
those you know places who

361
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,959
you know maybe kind of uh you know have

362
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,560
kind of a security mindset that you can

363
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,480
pull into uh into um security roles you

364
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,839
know and i think

365
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,519
i think the one thing that sets security

366
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,880
folks apart is

367
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,240
and the one thing you have to look for

368
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,320
whether you're recruiting outsider or or

369
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,440
internally

370
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,959
is you know

371
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,639
i always kind of say i can teach anybody

372
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,440
security i cannot teach you an innate

373
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,519
level of curiosity that says what's next

374
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,880
what's next what's next right and it's

375
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,279
kind of that constant question asking

376
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,120
that security professionals do all the

377
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,240
time right

378
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,120
um

379
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,279
you know i can i can take anybody who

380
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,040
has that and i can teach them security

381
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,639
that's not the hard part the hard part

382
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,560
the harder part in a lot of cases that i

383
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,959
find is is really finding the folks who

384
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,360
have that kind of innate sense of

385
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,480
curiosity that innate sense of kind of

386
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,079
okay you've given me an answer but i

387
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,120
want to know the answer behind the

388
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,399
answer and then the answer behind the

389
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,079
answer right which is what you know from

390
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,600
a security perspective we do all the

391
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
time whether it's threat modeling or

392
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,760
third-party risk assessment or whatever

393
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,839
but i think there's you know uh there

394
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,160
there's a definitely a couple different

395
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,320
a lot of different factors and areas to

396
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,160
look at when it comes to to pulling

397
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,920
talent into your team

398
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,519
thank you jessica i think another

399
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,120
question that has come in that we'll

400
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,360
answer in a moment is the transition

401
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,839
like people are that are not in security

402
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,920
like kind of what is the pathway to move

403
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,360
into that so we will address that i

404
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
guess throw it

405
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,399
to both of you kind of

406
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,880
i've seen you both scale large teams in

407
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,120
the last 12 18 months

408
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,639
what's your secret source what's kind of

409
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,839
how have you been in this kind of

410
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,279
competitive market recently of course

411
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,000
i'm not going to tell you

412
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,360
and then you will know right so now my

413
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,680
point is um going back to the challenges

414
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,519
let's assume that all these you know

415
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,680
combines and all these processes they

416
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,399
are they are good which uh

417
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,839
the norm is that there is work to be

418
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,320
done then what is hiring right it's like

419
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,560
there is a lot of work that uh

420
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,399
goes back to us right it's like you may

421
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,959
have an amazing talent acquisition team

422
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,560
but you know um

423
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,639
in my experience over the last probably

424
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,480
three four years

425
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,000
around sixty seventy percent of the

426
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,360
sourcing

427
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,440
is internal sourcing right and it's done

428
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,279
by us right these references that we

429
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,360
know people from the past or friends or

430
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,720
friends or campaigns that we do

431
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,279
internally right so

432
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,120
hiring the challenges is to to

433
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,000
differentiate yourself from caleb from

434
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
jessica from others right because at the

435
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
end of the day you know they are i mean

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,079
they are csos and css for amazing

437
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,600
companies and you need to make sure that

438
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,680
the candidate understands why we are

439
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,920
better than others or why we are uh

440
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,199
different than others let's say this way

441
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,199
right and and one thing that i do is

442
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,959
like i uh at the end of the process

443
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,680
whenever we do an offer um and this is

444
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,839
well i'll disclose a secret i do

445
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,600
something that i called a champion call

446
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,560
right

447
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,920
and i talked to the candidates and i

448
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
explained them hey now you have an offer

449
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,440
and you also have an offer from google

450
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,800
you have an offer from robinhood you

451
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,480
have an offer from all these places and

452
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,639
i told them amazing companies right but

453
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,639
let me tell you why databricks is better

454
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,360
from my opinion let me tell you why um

455
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,720
the culture that we're trying to build

456
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
here the challenge of the company right

457
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,040
uh uh where we're going and all these

458
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,720
things let me give you enough

459
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
information

460
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,680
for you to make an informed decision

461
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,279
right those champion calls they are

462
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,800
amazing right

463
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,279
i uh i'll give i'll give all my secrets

464
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,480
out so

465
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,360
i

466
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,920
need a notebook it's it's so here's the

467
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,759
thing is i actually find i do a little

468
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,639
bit the opposite um you know what i tend

469
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,800
to find is like

470
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,160
by and large most interviews are

471
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,399
the company vetting the candidate it's

472
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
basically like hey prove to us that

473
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,800
you're good enough to work here and then

474
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,399
we'll sell you

475
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,279
right so i just reversed it so i just

476
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,839
said okay it doesn't matter who you are

477
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,519
what we're going to do is i call this

478
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,519
the reverse interview

479
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,519
and many of you who work maybe at robin

480
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,199
hood have probably been been through

481
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,279
this with me is the first call and this

482
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,279
is what i mean by dedication and time so

483
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,959
you understand the level at least when

484
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,240
building the team that you have to

485
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,519
commit

486
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,839
in the first calls i will sit for 30

487
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,160
minutes and i'll basically say you can

488
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,839
ask me the questions

489
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,480
you can interview me if i can sell you

490
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,839
on me the company the culture the people

491
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,680
at the beginning

492
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,600
because it's to me it's like let me

493
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
prove to you why we're good enough for

494
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
you to come work for us

495
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,959
then they get hooked and when they're

496
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,079
hooked

497
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,920
they're more excited to go through the

498
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,040
process

499
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,800
and so then it's not at the end where

500
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,959
you do the battle you just do it right

501
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,040
at the beginning and by the way

502
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,119
i've had candidates

503
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,640
at the beginning we'll go through that

504
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,000
at the beginning the candidate will say

505
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,839
hey i don't think this is probably the

506
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,959
right fit

507
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,559
and i'd be like that's awesome and we

508
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,160
figured it out right right there at the

509
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,199
beginning

510
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,280
and i found like that to be one of the

511
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,000
most amazing things is when people go

512
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,520
through that process

513
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,119
you know the

514
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,679
the culture of us is basically saying

515
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,919
how can we tell you that robin hood is a

516
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,760
great company to work out how can i tell

517
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
you that i'm a good leader or person to

518
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,280
work with

519
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,679
and as soon as that is good i think that

520
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,840
opens up the floodgates of the candidate

521
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,320
going through and asking the questions

522
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,280
and that's helped a lot and by the way i

523
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,480
you know at the beginning when you're

524
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,320
building a team i don't care if you're a

525
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,919
junior i don't care if you're an intern

526
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,760
i don't care if you're senior i will do

527
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,520
those calls with you

528
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,840
obviously as the comp as the team scales

529
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,919
as the company scales it becomes a lot

530
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,400
harder for me to do those things but i

531
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,840
always offer

532
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,160
in across the board one you gotta tell

533
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,600
your managers and your leaders can you

534
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,760
convey that same culture to them

535
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,320
and two i also offer hey if you have

536
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,799
candidates that you consider sort of p0

537
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,400
like you know they're coming in this is

538
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,039
a the you you definitely like i'll go

539
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,039
and do it like i'll come in and say

540
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,640
right at the beginning in the first call

541
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,720
reverse interview what can i answer for

542
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,320
you and so that's a it's a big secret um

543
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,280
so

544
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,799
for those of you

545
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,799
uh

546
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,480
really working hard over there but it's

547
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,919
i think it's helped a lot and it helps

548
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,640
establish a lot of uh trust i think with

549
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,559
the candidates um one thing i want to

550
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,240
mention is like um we're talking about

551
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,120
the edges of the process yeah it is key

552
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,039
the the the interview i mean even in the

553
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,559
middle right uh

554
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,039
the candidate through the through the

555
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,039
the panels through talking to people

556
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,559
either interviewing one way or the other

557
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,400
ways because remember whenever you

558
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,840
interview for a company it's two ways to

559
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,000
interview right is to give them a an

560
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,640
amazing experience that's that's uh they

561
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,000
are literally going to have four or five

562
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,280
hours

563
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,160
with with the company uh they you need

564
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,840
to sell them and they need to not only

565
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,960
to sell them

566
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,480
sell certain the reality of how it's

567
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,840
going to be them to be working over

568
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,520
there right it's not only on the edges

569
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,120
it's through the interview

570
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,200
everyone through the panel the the

571
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,720
interview uh

572
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
the interviewers you know to to to be

573
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,240
able to explain how it's going to be why

574
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,960
uh working for this company is is a good

575
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,320
thing what are the challenges what is

576
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,760
the company where is the company going

577
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,919
right and these touches of caleb doing

578
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,360
at the beginning or myself doing it at

579
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,120
the end is what what's what help but

580
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,440
this through the interview process

581
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,559
i can tell you from firsthand

582
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,720
experiences that actually from the

583
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,320
recruitment process

584
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,840
having that

585
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,280
kind of level of involvement in

586
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,160
investment and communication is is such

587
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,840
a golden thread of of how you've been

588
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,559
successful in hiring it it adds so much

589
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,880
difference and is a big differentiating

590
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,559
factor against a lot of other companies

591
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,000
out there for sure one other thing i

592
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,240
just want to put like a double plus one

593
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,000
on is the firm is thinking about

594
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,600
transparency

595
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,440
right when you go through the interview

596
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,640
process

597
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,559
um i think it's so key

598
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,640
you know i've heard from others where

599
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,400
um people will candidates will go

600
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,640
through an interview process and the

601
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,799
in the company will just sell how great

602
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,840
they are what awesome things that they

603
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,520
do um and then when you walk in the door

604
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
you're surprised at the

605
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,200
the the

606
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
disaster that you've kind of walked into

607
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,960
uh which by the way you all know this

608
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,400
every company is a disaster behind the

609
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,559
scenes so like we all know this

610
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,960
um and so but i think being up front

611
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,039
about it is really really key and what

612
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,559
he was pointing is like talk about the

613
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,200
challenges talk about the the disaster

614
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,039
that it is because that's the thing i

615
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,799
think candidates really like because

616
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,960
that shows hey those are things i can

617
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,760
have impact on right like i've done you

618
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,919
know sdlc before and if you're telling

619
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,320
me your sdlc is super immature and

620
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,919
really early you need a lot of help like

621
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,760
wow that means i can come in and really

622
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,840
add the value that i've learned in my

623
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,559
past and so i found you know again that

624
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,640
transparency thing is really key yeah

625
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,720
you know if you don't do it

626
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,480
in six months that person is going to be

627
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,400
gone and you're back into you know the

628
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,159
first stage so you you lost you

629
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,080
essentially waste time for the candidate

630
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,159
and yourself

631
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,280
that's a great point right i mean i

632
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,200
think most folks you know when they're

633
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,080
looking at you know uh leaving a company

634
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,520
they're looking for a challenge right

635
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,120
most people want a challenge they want a

636
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,559
vision of

637
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,360
where

638
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,559
where is

639
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,159
where is this company going where's this

640
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,799
organization going you know

641
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,320
what am i getting myself into and i

642
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,919
think that um

643
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,960
you know being able to kind of sell the

644
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,159
here's the challenge and here's where

645
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,440
you have opportunity to make impact

646
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,159
because

647
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,960
sell the disaster

648
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,600
and have an impact right like i think

649
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
it's just a fundamental human part of

650
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
human nature is you want to be able to

651
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,679
make a change so make a difference

652
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,159
nice you talk about kind of um

653
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,679
trust and transparency i think we're

654
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,440
talking about kind of hiring and how we

655
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,799
get people through the door i think a

656
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,480
nice little segue

657
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,120
is around kind of retention right now i

658
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,960
think there's a lot of companies that

659
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,799
kind of the term

660
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,360
great resignation gets overused but has

661
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
been a thing i've seen a lot of people

662
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
move and and kind of a lot of churn from

663
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,919
a lot of companies so

664
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,799
what what do you do to build trust

665
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,520
collaboration transparency

666
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,919
in a remote workforce like this this is

667
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,320
such an amazing time to have so many

668
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,400
people in a room right now but it's rare

669
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,080
it's it's rare that we have this kind of

670
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
face time so

671
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,400
how do you get how do you build trust

672
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,200
and collaboration in a remote workforce

673
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,000
um

674
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,919
the first thing i do is i block code red

675
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,080
from the email system so you cannot talk

676
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,960
to my people

677
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,440
at the end of the day i mean same as you

678
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,520
are attracting candidates to increase

679
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,120
your security team the size of the

680
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,440
security team you need to make sure that

681
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,240
you spend equal or more time

682
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,200
building

683
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,240
you know the the qualities of an amazing

684
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,360
team right

685
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,880
that we operate as a team or

686
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,000
psychological safety or where we we got

687
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,440
each other's back and things that you

688
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
need to build a culture where people say

689
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,240
you know what you know i could go

690
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,679
shop around interview and things like

691
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,799
that but why should i i'm happy here i

692
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,480
am challenged and doing the amazing

693
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,880
things that i i uh that i'm doing right

694
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
now that they are up to my expectations

695
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,360
why should i risk this right so it's

696
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,000
super super important to build that uh

697
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,600
to spend that time to build those

698
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,720
qualities inside the team

699
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,070
and of course blocky

700
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,559
[Music]

701
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,200
we'll talk after okay

702
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,679
i think there's there's a couple um

703
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,279
thoughts um

704
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,960
so

705
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,360
i think that the pandemic did some great

706
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,240
things which is it allowed everybody to

707
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
work remote which means now we started

708
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,600
hiring remotely in a company like

709
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,279
docusign where we used to hire everybody

710
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,760
in san francisco and seattle now i've

711
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,440
got a third of my team is probably

712
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,960
remote all over the united states right

713
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,279
which is you know fantastic because we

714
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,840
changed a lot of culture around how the

715
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,720
company thought about things um that you

716
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,960
know the downside is is now you know how

717
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,080
do you operate in that in that world um

718
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,679
you know i would say that the the

719
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,679
biggest thing that i learned is over

720
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,720
communicate if you think you're

721
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,080
communicating enough with people you're

722
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,360
not communicating enough with the people

723
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,200
i'm going to tell you right now because

724
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
now all you have all these remote folks

725
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,480
and they all feel

726
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,559
remote and alone right

727
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,440
and so it's really hard for them to feel

728
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,200
connected to a building i'll be i'll be

729
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,679
really honest i started at docusign

730
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,360
april 2020

731
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
post everything shutting down

732
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,760
i didn't come into an office until i

733
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,720
think

734
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,039
april of this year and you know when you

735
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,559
go in you're like oh hey there's walls

736
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,640
in a building and i feel physically tan

737
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,880
i feel tangibly connected to this thing

738
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
and these people right and that's that's

739
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,799
really hard when you have somebody who

740
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,200
is remote and it's really easy for them

741
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,240
to feel

742
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,520
like they're just doing the job and

743
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,440
disconnect it from the broader group so

744
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,600
i would say you know over communicate

745
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,760
you know that if that means that's where

746
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,159
i spend i would say so much of my time

747
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,320
uh monthly amas one-on-ones with

748
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,240
everybody i have 110 people on my team i

749
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,360
still try to do one-on-ones with

750
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
everybody at least you know

751
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,840
one supporter it's it's tough but we we

752
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,440
get through it usually you do well to be

753
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,840
hit today then right

754
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,720
right now with 100.

755
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
you know forums like we've we've had to

756
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,480
like get creative around how do we get

757
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,559
these different groups inside of you

758
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,240
know the work just to communicate

759
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,840
together right and that's been another

760
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,960
thing is like

761
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,080
again there's all those those uh

762
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,000
stop by the desk conversations that

763
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,840
don't happen in a remote workforce and

764
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,320
so people feel like they struggle with

765
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
understanding what's happening you know

766
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,000
what's happening across the organization

767
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,840
who's doing what you know kind of that

768
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,679
natural conversation kind of things that

769
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,720
would normally happen don't get it

770
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,799
happen so you really have to be

771
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,039
very intentional about how you

772
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,559
make that happen and you know i think as

773
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,400
you know the leader of the organization

774
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,320
our respective organizations is up to us

775
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,159
to make that happen right because

776
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,760
otherwise it's it you know it will

777
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,000
happen organically at a maybe a group

778
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,080
level but at an org level it it'll

779
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,880
struggle sometimes

780
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,799
yeah i really don't have a good answer

781
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,720
for this that's why i'm learning from

782
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,039
these two i'll add these two so i can

783
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:27,320
learn

[Music]

785
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,080
i would just say this i think that what

786
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,840
i've noticed if i were to think about an

787
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,000
overall

788
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,400
challenge with remote work is it seems

789
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,760
to me that

790
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,159
remote work there's there's like

791
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,039
is really lends itself well for

792
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,480
in-depth tunnel focus sort of vision and

793
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,640
working hard through deep problems right

794
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,159
like real work

795
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,120
as long as you're not on slack um

796
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,720
and then the

797
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,960
but what really suffers is decision

798
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,120
making fast decision making i think

799
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,320
suffers

800
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,000
um and so

801
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,880
it's difficult to figure out well how do

802
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,279
you really make up the fast decision

803
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:07,720
making

804
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,799

805

problem

806
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,159
working remotely and i'll be very blunt

807
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,760
i don't know

808
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,600
of a great answer to that

809
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,360
i think there's lots of different

810
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,159
thoughts from you know daily stand-ups

811
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,039
to

812
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,799
you know having a strategy meeting

813
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,559
everyone comes in the office once a day

814
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,000
or once a week you know what are these

815
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,399
whatever these things are but um i don't

816
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,120
know i would love if people have good

817
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,640
thoughts on that that would be great to

818
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,919
hear i think elon musk uh has recently

819
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,480
made a decision on how that works maybe

820
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,600
don't take advice from that one

821
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,799
um it's a good opportunity i mean i'm

822
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,039
for hiring it's a great opportunity

823
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,320
no i mean think about this i'm pretty

824
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
sure some some people are going to be

825
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,159
happy because they want to go to the

826
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,080
office some people they don't want

827
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,600
they feel like okay maybe one or two

828
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,120
days some people is like no i don't want

829
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,919
to go to the office right so you know

830
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,279
he's made the call well one thing to

831
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,760
respect is he made the call yeah exactly

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,080

833
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,240
in and i mean it's

834
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,760
you got to respect the stance he made

835
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,240
the call and he's owning it like he is

836
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,480
he is present and he is there in the

837
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,399
factories every day so yeah

a lot of people come to to our booth and

841
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,960
we talked about this panel today and not

842
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,200
to inflate all of your egos

843
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,480
but you are very seasoned leaders um a

844
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,399
common question that's come through is

845
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,760
we fake it well

846
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,120

848
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,080
you've done great work with hiring

849
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,919
talent but a common question that's come

850
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,679
through that knowing that i had this

851
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,600

853
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,679

854
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,760
into a kind of a leadership opportunity

855
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
i want to scale a team i know that this

856
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,840
is thinking back many moons from when

857
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
you're kind of just building a team out

858
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,679
what advice would you give to somebody

859
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,360
that is starting kind of their

860
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,600
management career and needs to hire

861

862
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,880
um so i would say for for

863
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,039
someone who is uh uh

864
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,080

hardest job you will ever do i'm just

868
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,880
gonna say this like i i think that you

869
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,960
know we talk about resignations and

870
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,919
people leaving and you know

871
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,679
it hurts right like i hear people give

872
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,919
resonations and i'm just like oh my gosh

873
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,760
like another one right and so you know

874
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,240
you you you feel that you kind of feel

875
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,480
very connected to your people hopefully

876
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,080
and hopefully you know you you build

877
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,440
that investment so when people do leave

878
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,720
it's it's tough um i would say that um

879
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,760
you know

880
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,480
the

881
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,320
from uh

882
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,080
the first thing that

883
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,480
you'll want to understand kind of moving

884
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,760
into a new

885
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,159
into a new manager role is

886
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,320
it really is about

887
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,039
building that investment and that

888
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,799
mindshare with

889
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,960
um with your team and with the members

890
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,159
of the team that you're bringing on

891
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,440
board

892
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,840
um i think that you know there's there's

893
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,919
a saying that you know and i don't know

894
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,279
how true it is today but there's a

895
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,559
saying that you know

896
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,080
people you know uh

897
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,200
what's the saying something about people

898
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,120
don't leave great managers they leave

899
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,520
they leave bad companies um and i think

900
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,840
that you know there's uh

901
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,480
there there is a big piece and and it

902
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,360
gets understated where you know

903
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,080
a great manager can hold a team together

904
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,360
right even through a lot of uh adversity

905
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,760
as a company and i think that um

906
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,919
you know building that mind share and

907
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,519
building that relationship with your

908
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,039
folks and

909
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,159
is going to be

910
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,080
you know job number one and i've i'll be

911
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,480
honest um i've learned from so many

912
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,559
people who have been

913
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,559
uh peers of mine on you know how to

914
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,000
uh build team cohesion how to uh

915
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,120
lift your team up um you know

916
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,600
and really kind of make uh you know the

917
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,799
folks on your team sort of the front and

918
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,320
you know i support them from behind i

919
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,679
think the other thing is

920
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,279
you know make sure that you are being

921
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,840
intentional about building diverse teams

922
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,519
and i know you know we we talk about it

923
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,760
all the time but you know it we still

924
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,519
haven't done enough and i'm going to be

925
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,279
raise a hand docusign hasn't done enough

926
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,799
to build diverse teams

927
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,399
um you know who are your who who are in

928
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:47,600
your

929
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
who's in your interview panels is it all

930
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,679
white guys because if a black woman

931
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,200
walks in the room there's

932
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,960
gonna be really tough if any kind of

933
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,559
underrepresented minority rocks in the

934
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,919
room it's gonna be tough it's gonna be

935
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,320
very intimidating right going or it's

936
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,720
going to give a real insight into the

937
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,399
culture of the company right it's all

938
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,440
very

939
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,279
monochrome

940
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,720
you know i think that you know

941
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,159
hiring

942
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,799
diverse candidates you know building

943
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,519
diverse teams bringing in different um

944
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,799
points of view

945
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:19,760
you know

946
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,360
be flexible with who you hire like like

947
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,679
i said before like there are

948
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,399
people that you will identify in other

949
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,159
groups in your company and you will say

950
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,679
and i've done this before and it's

951
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,960
actually one of the biggest things

952
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,440
that's brought me joy is i will take you

953
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,919
know somebody who is in desktop support

954
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,360
and they're they're like hey i'm

955
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,200
interested in the cyber security thing

956
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,960
like what should i do and i'm like yeah

957
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,440
come on come over here right

958
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,799
and building them up and now they're

959
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,640
architects at ebay and stuff like that

960
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
right and you kind of get to see them

961
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,320
you know kind of grow up and move and i

962
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,760
think that um

963
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,720
you know finding that that diamond and

964
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,039
the rough talent and and and being like

965
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,760
yes you i want you on my team right and

966
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,399
in making that sense of inclusion

967
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,320
you know they don't need to be you know

968
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,640
the whiz-bang hacker right um some of

969
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,559
the best folks on my team were

970
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,080
you know

971
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,320
in the video editing business right like

972
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,919
they had nothing to do with with cyber

973
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,840
security or even with technology in

974
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,080
general but you know now they're like

975
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,360
kind of some of the leads of some of our

976
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,320
biggest projects so i think that um it

977
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,440
really is

978
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,840
key to look outside of kind of just the

979
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,440
normal box of where you would look to

980
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,799
hire from

981
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,559
so i'm sorry long answer

982
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,440
that was

983
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,120
a great great answer

984
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,960
in fact there's not much i think i can

985
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,720
follow on to that because i think these

986
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,840
are all phenomenal points around

987
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,159
just learning how to be a manager and a

988
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,559
leader and what are some great so i'm

989
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,399
going to be a little bit more tactical

990
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,080
on mine and i'll be very security

991
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,600
focused since i think you really covered

992
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,399
a lot

993
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,399
um i'll say when i think when you're

994
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,399
thinking about building your team

995
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,360
um

996
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,279
you know first if you're a first time

997
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,960
leader and manager building a team this

998
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,559
probably means you're working at a small

999
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,559
company would be my guess and you're

1000
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,799
starting from scratch so i would

1001
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,119
recommend two things in when you're

1002
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,440
looking for your first team to hire

1003
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,639
which is going to be really important

1004
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,960
whoever those first people are that you

1005
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,560
hire are going to help set your culture

1006
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,760
of your team

1007
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,480
first i would probably focus on good

1008
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,000
general athletes

1009
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,159
the and second they need to have the

1010
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,480
attitude to sort of a point made earlier

1011
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,599
around curiosity um hard work good

1012
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,760
general athletes when you're small and

1013
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,520
you're starting a team it's not like oh

1014
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,280
i need someone really good at dnr oh i

1015
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,719
need someone really good at pen tests oh

1016
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,800
i need someone really good at appsec

1017
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,719
you need people who have some good

1018
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,359
diverse experience and just want to dive

1019
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,280
into they just they're curious they just

1020
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,359
want to learn and they want to dive so

1021
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,280
when you think about hiring

1022
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,839
those the first sort of three or four

1023
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,679
people around you

1024
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,199
really look at some good general

1025
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,800
athletes and how they're going to help

1026
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,119
you um and also you always need one

1027
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,640
person that's going to that's going to

1028
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,560
help tie all the

1029
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,920
people policy programs compliance you

1030
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,440
need one of those

1031
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,520
in your teams to help tie everything

1032
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,400
together too um i would say those would

1033
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,800
be the the tactical things i might say

1034
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,880
when you're a first-time manager

1035
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,280
okay um yeah i don't know what i can say

1036
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,680
after this

1037
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,040
at least next time

1038
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,320
i will try it right so you're you're a

1039
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
new manager right so on top of all the

1040
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,599
new things that you need to do you need

1041
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,480
to build

1042
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,000
feature x or you need to mitigate

1043
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,599
whatever it is right so there's a lot of

1044
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,520
pressure right and then

1045
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,960
you you need to build a team and you

1046
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,400
need maybe you have two or three people

1047
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,680
four people you need to retain those

1048
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,520
people right on top of that you need to

1049
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,800
you know increase the team size to

1050
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,240
deliver you know the final thing that

1051
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,079
you work hard for right so there's a lot

1052
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,920
of pressure right so the the best advice

1053
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,040
that uh

1054
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,280
i can give you to a new uh manager is

1055
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,440
like don't be a hero you are not alone

1056
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,359
right so start talking to others start

1057
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,000
leveraging uh you know the knowledge and

1058
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,839
expertise from other people get a mentor

1059
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,359
uh talk to

1060
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,920
andreas there's actually uh maybe not

1061
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,680
even in your company there's a people in

1062
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,480
the industry that uh they do the hey i'm

1063
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,800
the cso for well i'm going to quote uh

1064
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,040
someone that i know nico weisman cecil

1065
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,200
for left he does

1066
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,960
uh sessions uh with uh you know uh folks

1067
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,560
from the industry that they want to be a

1068
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,320
new sis or they want to do these things

1069
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,880
right so kudos to nico by the way um

1070
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,320
what i'm trying to say is that you have

1071
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,040
your job to to do you have a job to

1072
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,560
retain the people the good people that

1073
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,320
you have so you need to invest in you

1074
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,000
know the good qualities that i was

1075
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,079
talking about and then you need to hire

1076
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,839
right and don't be a hero there is

1077
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:40,960
multiple things and you will make

1078
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,000
mistakes

1079
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,839
it's totally expected i mean i made a

1080
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,720
ton of mistakes i i probably should not

1081
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,920
mention them because this is being

1082
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,960
recorded

1083
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,560
but uh you know it's okay to make

1084
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,720
mistakes because by making mistakes you

1085
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,680
learn

1086
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,520
for the next one you're going to do

1087
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,040
better you're going to retain your your

1088
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,640
team better you're going to hire people

1089
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,040
better right and other things that uh

1090
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,760
that jessica and keleb mentioned is like

1091
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,280
you know the the

1092
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,960
i mean hiring only security

1093

professionals with security experience

1094
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,520

1095
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,160
hiring people new grads i'm

1096
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,760

1098
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,079

1099
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,599

professional that's another one right

1104
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,119

1105

whole cso panel

1117
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,760
because i just want to just re-emphasize

1118
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,880

1119
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,119

1127
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,880
critical you know

1128
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,480
nice thank you folks

1129
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
um i had a question come through from uh

1130
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,040
twitter the last couple of days and it's

1131
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,720
kind of related to recruiting but it's

1132
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,320
um and maybe we'll start with you

1133
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,040
further okay

1134
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
you guys battle between yourselves uh

1135
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,480
with all the economic uncertainty we're

1136
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,160
seeing right now especially in the tech

1137
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,359
space um companies making layoffs um and

1138
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,240
cuts generally how do you

1139
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,079
plan to make security a priority your

1140
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,240
company

1141
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,160
i mean it depends on the context of the

1142
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,680
company right so

1143
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,320
um in in the context of data breaks

1144
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,079
right because of the product that we

1145
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,119
sell right to some degree we we deals

1146
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,480
with other secret sauce right so

1147
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,079
security is a priority for the company

1148
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,040
right at the end of the day under any

1149
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,520
financial situation right you you are

1150
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,040
going to take a look to what are my

1151
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,560
priorities uh

1152
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,040
you know marketing or uh

1153
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,520
sales or engineering but

1154
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,079
for us security is a key pillar because

1155
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,800
without security um there is no gtm uh

1156
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,960
focus here right so

1157
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,640
obviously i mean there

1158
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,480
i mean we will see this and we i don't

1159
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,680
have a crystal ball to see if we're

1160
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,960
going to go into a recession or not and

1161
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,800
things like that companies are adjusting

1162
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,720
right for me

1163
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,359
it's not a challenge it's an opportunity

1164
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,200
right because uh if companies are

1165
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,119
adjusting it's like hey uh

1166
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,680
let me take a look why uh i mean let me

1167
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,520
go into linkedin and search for all

1168
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,760
those tesla security engineers that may

1169
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,839
not want to go back to the office right

1170
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,359
because there could be good people over

1171
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,240
there right so again

1172
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,000
take advantage of your strengths as

1173
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,640
exploit the weaknesses of others

1174
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,880
i'm going to be a little spicy on this

1175
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,119
one

1176
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,079
my thoughts are are don't try to make

1177
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,839
security the top priority in the company

1178
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,960
i don't think

1179
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,520
oh well i got one fan on that spicy

1180
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:11,900
condom

1181
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,000
[Music]

1182
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,040
isn't that your boss over there

1183
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,200
yeah

1184
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
um

1185
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,400
yeah i would say you know when you think

1186
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,480
about like that it doesn't matter what

1187
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,079
business you're in security is never

1188
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,280
going to be the top priority even if

1189
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,839
you're a security vendor uh it's not the

1190
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,119
top priority um what i would focus on

1191
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,200
instead is there are spots or areas in

1192
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,000
your company that you can make security

1193
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
in the top three right or at least in

1194
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,920
the top five

1195
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,760
um and so the way like i think about it

1196
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,839
i'll be very sort of generic is like you

1197
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,359
ever heard of sort of like the intel

1198
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,359
architecture ring zero ring one like

1199
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,200
there's like in ring zero this is your

1200
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,560
top critical super paranoia ring one a

1201
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,400
little bit less ring two ring three you

1202
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,720
know you can look there are across an

1203
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,040
organization they're gonna be different

1204
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,760
levels of where security really needs to

1205
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,480
be priority versus where it doesn't

1206
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,599
or where you can be a little more

1207
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,079
relaxed and i think you need to find the

1208
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,480
areas that are the most critical for you

1209
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,520
to have either ring zero or ring one

1210
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,839
focus on those areas and help the team

1211
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,240
do it and ultimately if you really do

1212
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,440
the job really well security does become

1213
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,280
a little bit more built in and becomes

1214
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,359
more invisible to the business and what

1215
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:30,800
it does

1216
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,480
but i think those are the key areas i

1217
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,280
would focus on hey this team in this

1218
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,880
specific area what they're doing is

1219
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,760
super sensitive and super uh super like

1220
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,400
we got to focus on that help go to them

1221
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,560
and figure out how to embed security

1222
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,800
into their processes and make that a

1223
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
priority with that team and you can make

1224
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,040
a lot of progress that way

1225
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,359
okay so

1226
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,400
yeah i think that um you know from a

1227
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,359
from a

1228
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,760
from a docusign perspective you know we

1229
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,560
uh we consider ourselves a trust brand

1230
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,000
we use that terminology all the time

1231
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,560
it's all over the place right um we hold

1232
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,000
everybody's data right we hold

1233
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,160
everybody's mortgage documents and loan

1234
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,440
signings and i'm sure everybody's

1235
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,520
documented something once

1236
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,359
it'd be an interesting study on who

1237
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,839
hasn't but anyway um you know but all

1238
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,599
that data yeah lives in our cloud right

1239
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:20,640
and so

1240
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,800
um

1241
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,800
you know from our perspective uh you

1242
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,520
know

1243
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,960
we're going to continue to build and

1244
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,800
grow our team that's that's not really a

1245
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,720
concern from my perspective you know i

1246
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,400
think that um

1247
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,000
you know and we'll take advantage of

1248
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,920
everybody who's laying off and we'll

1249
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,359
pull all those people over because it's

1250
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,960
good talent

1251
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,400
i think there's a huge opportunity yeah

1252
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
i agree entirely i think that you can

1253
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,640
spin out his head and say we're able to

1254
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,400
reach out to talent and attract talent

1255
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,119
that we weren't able to do so 12 18

1256
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,680
months ago yeah but tom i mean that's if

1257
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,680
if you have the

1258
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,040
if you have the opportunity to keep

1259
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,480
growing right because there is companies

1260
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,760
that they will not because you know

1261
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,000
security you know as i agree with caleb

1262
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,440
right it's like may not be their

1263
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,200
priority one of their top priorities

1264
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,040
right so then what do you do you focus

1265
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,440
on retaining your people right you you

1266
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,680
going instead of going out out there is

1267
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,319
that you try to protect your your your

1268
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,640
crown you also essentially or or if you

1269
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,240
think about it if security is not your

1270
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,800
top priority right which listen at the

1271
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,880
end of the day every business like will

1272
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,520
always say hey security is important but

1273
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,680
it's never the top well why well because

1274
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,839
the top business the top party is being

1275
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:28,880
a business

1276
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,640
right we all know this like we have to

1277
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,720
be a business otherwise we security

1278
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,079
doesn't matter because we won't exist we

1279
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,440
need to make and that is really

1280
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,200
ultimately the most secure to be blind

1281
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,440
um but here's the thing is like we know

1282
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,240
this then our job is not to go and fight

1283
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,240
for the top spot and also i feel like as

1284
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,079
our job as an expectation as being in

1285
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,240
this industry is we're not going to be

1286
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,640
the top priority so how do we make

1287
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,240
changes and impact in order knowing that

1288
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,560
and knowing it in a way that enables the

1289
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,000
teams

1290
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,839
sets the right context around what

1291
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,240
they're doing allows them to say hey

1292
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,880
it's not just hey do this to be secure

1293
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,040
but hey if you do this it's an easier

1294
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,280
route of what you're doing today and it

1295
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,839
also happens to be secure right this is

1296
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,560
a much better model and allows you to

1297
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,319
align with the business allows you to

1298
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,800
make more more progress with the with

1299
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,400
engineer and the rest of the

1300
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,319
cross-functional partners and you're not

1301
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,599
like i should we should set that

1302
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,599
expectation like hey

1303
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,680
as although it's great when the ceo

1304
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,280
stands up and says hey security is

1305
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,440
important privacy is important right

1306
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,119
like for example at robin hood we have a

1307
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,280
safety first right that's right in our

1308
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,960
principles it's great when you hear that

1309
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,640
happen but like let's set the

1310
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,960
expectations hey at the end of the day

1311
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,800
it's awesome to hear it but when it

1312
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,960
comes to execution let's not expect it

1313
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,359
and let's not rely on it right we can't

1314
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,960
rely on someone at the top saying it's

1315
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,880
important for us to adopt what we're

1316
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,800
doing we've got to assume that they're

1317
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,960
not and that we're not the top priority

1318
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,000
so then how does that change our

1319
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,880
thinking

1320
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,440
yeah it's um i'm sorry to hijack this a

1321
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,000
little bit but it's a it's a question of

1322
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,079
being more efficient right at the end of

1323
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,440
the day

1324
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,200
i'm pretty sure that all of you have a

1325
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,720
long laundry list of things that they

1326
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,200
are wrong in in your own companies right

1327
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,599
um and if you go one by one it probably

1328
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,200
will take ten years to do all of that

1329
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,480
right so

1330
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,400
what are the top three top four top five

1331
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,119
that

1332
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,520
if you have resources not infinite ones

1333
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,280
or maybe less than what you have right

1334
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,040
now because there may be a recession or

1335
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,160
whatever right

1336
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,440
what are those ones that they are going

1337
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,200
to be giving you the most bank for the

1338
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,280
back right so completely agree with you

1339
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,280
caleb

1340
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,400
great stuff well i think we've got time

1341
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,319
for one last question something that you

1342
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,319
actually kind of indirectly addressed

1343
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,079
earlier but it's a dying question i've

1344
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,520
had about from three four different

1345
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,400
people

1346
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,920
what skill sets do you think can be

1347
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,400
learnt on the job for security folks

1348
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,280
i guess what skill sets can't

1349
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,240
um you know i i

1350
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,599
think i'm gonna repeat myself a little

1351
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,640
bit but you know there is

1352
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,119
if i look at what makes you know some of

1353
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,920
the best security folks on my team it's

1354
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,319
not the background that they have it's

1355
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,359
not

1356
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,400
the

1357
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,359
you know

1358
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,880
experience that they have although that

1359
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,240
helps right but i think fundamentally it

1360
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,960
is right in and whether it's incident

1361
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,200
response threat models

1362
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,359
engineering i'm sitting down with the

1363
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,520
development team talking about a new

1364
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,480
feature

1365
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,800
it's always asking the

1366
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,359
okay that's great and what else and what

1367
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,720
else and what else right it's that

1368
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,119
curiosity of getting to and sort of

1369
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,880
extracting and pulling apart everything

1370
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,880
and figuring you know and being able to

1371
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,079
understand

1372
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,640
the inputs and outputs and and the

1373
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,960
of a thing right and and how it works

1374
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,640
and what are all the things that a

1375
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,560
development team is not telling you

1376
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,680
about that or the really really

1377
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,040
interesting parts when you start asking

1378
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,480
questions and it's like

1379
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,599
yeah uh and and so

1380
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,280
again i think that is

1381
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,480
that kind of that curiosity then and

1382
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,240
that innate um

1383
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,359
you know

1384
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,240
uh

1385
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,920
sort of follow-up is is the thing that

1386
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,119
you can't teach you know i i can bring

1387
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,800
folks in from

1388
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,720
community colleges and put them into a

1389
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,560
sock and teach them to be a sock analyst

1390
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,119
and then move them into ir i can put

1391
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,800
developers who do qa right work into

1392
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,760
apps teams i can pull you know folks who

1393
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,680
have done you know

1394
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,960
desktop support and put them in

1395
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,040
engineering teams right so there's a lot

1396
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,520
of transferable skills right pretty much

1397
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,040
anything that any group in a development

1398
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,480
slash i.t

1399
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,319
even legal and you know um

1400
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,960
finance organization was done has some

1401
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,400
translation

1402
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,079
capability you know uh into uh into a

1403
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,720
security function whether it's you know

1404
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,119
audit risk you know appsec secops right

1405
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,960
in any of those functions so yeah i

1406
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,359
think that uh it's it's really more

1407
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,319
about

1408
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:57,920
so i would say

1409
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,200
if you're thinking about going into

1410
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,319
security and you're hung up on the

1411
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,680
oh i don't know enough to go into

1412
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,079
security i'm going to tell you right now

1413
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:06,880
you

1414
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,000
probably

1415
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,440
there's an opportunity for you there

1416
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,520
somewhere i'm just saying like there is

1417
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,119
a security manager that's looking to

1418
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,599
hire you i promise um

1419
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,079
so you know i would i would definitely

1420
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,040
not be hung up on the well i don't know

1421
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,119
so i can't do this right and

1422
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,040
and and really look at the

1423
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,640
what do you know and what is the skill

1424
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,000
set that you do bring and then you know

1425
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,520
a good manager

1426
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,119
can probably map most skill sets into

1427
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,480
into what they need

1428
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,079
and

1429
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,599
form that person

1430
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,040
multi person

1431
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,720
i can do next so

1432
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,240
i'm going to differ a little bit into

1433
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,240
this one although i agree but i think

1434
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,720
there are other type of skills that uh

1435
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,800
you can learn on the job right um i mean

1436
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,240
apart from the technical skills i mean

1437
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,240
if you're on ir you know you will learn

1438
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,079
how to do forensics how to manage an

1439
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,000
investigation but at the end of the day

1440
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,920
security teams usually

1441
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,960
um

1442
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,160
we we interact with others so others do

1443
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,559
the the changes to mitigate risk and

1444
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,160
things like that right so

1445
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,839
the things that i uh think they are

1446
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,760
super super important are the soft

1447
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,440
skills how uh how you talk to others how

1448
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,960
you write an email

1449
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,200
i mean literally the way that you could

1450
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,200
write an email you could you could win

1451
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,960
someone

1452
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,280
or you could lose them forever right and

1453
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,880
and then if uh the way that you build

1454
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,400
the bridge they will the way that you

1455
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,160
it's totally different for example

1456
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,599
whenever you send an email to someone

1457
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,280
asking for hey sorry i'm going to run

1458
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,000
your friday but can you do this

1459
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,240
if you have had a coffee or a beer with

1460
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,400
that person before it's way way easier

1461
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,319
right so those soft skills how to build

1462
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,520
those bridges how do you you talk to a

1463
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,839
new person how do you understand their

1464
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:50,559
their world how do you uh try to you

1465
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,000
know to be a partner on their world

1466
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,079
while they win them over to be a partner

1467
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,720
in your world right so soft skills those

1468
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,880
are the things that and and they can be

1469
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,800
used not only in security in other other

1470
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,200
fields super super important right

1471
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,480
technical

1472
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,640
skills yeah you will keep growing

1473
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,760
but people

1474
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,280
usually forget about the other ones and

1475
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,599
they are probably as important as the

1476
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,240
technical ones

1477
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,280
yeah um i will say i agree with all of

1478
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,520
these um i actually

1479
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,520
will just add a nice to have

1480
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,400
um

1481
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,240
i don't think this is even an

1482
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,640
essence necessary i think it's just a

1483
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,200
little bit of passion for the field

1484
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,240
um

1485
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,440
you know like we're here on a sunday um
