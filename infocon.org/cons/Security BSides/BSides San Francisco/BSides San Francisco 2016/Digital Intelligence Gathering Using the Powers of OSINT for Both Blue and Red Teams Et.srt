00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,810
specialization incident response enjoys
research projects and as an aspiring

7
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,770
model where analysts

8
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:30,199
thank you for that introduction hey guys

ok I thought I'd be like a lot less and
people were just came today for an

11
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:42,299
excuse to work but she's not be the case

12
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:51,380
worries man I'm actually taken out on
vacation for a quick shower so I did not

13
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:57,810
leave this on my personal page right
here cuz I'm totally egotistical

14
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,979
the yellow and gray really mess with
your eyes

15
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,470
sorry guys I have my my co-worker
William to talk with the same color

16
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,970
scheme yesterday was fine I don't know
what's what's the difference here anyway

17
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:21,000
Brian where her and was originally
talked with me he's a good friend of

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,030
mine couple things came up and he wasn't
able to make it please keep in mind that

19
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,640
she participated in research with me and
I work very closely in several

20
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:43,910
capacities and follow him on Twitter at
Brian underscore we're so anyway so I

21
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:51,450
work in a company called you know how we
r start up here in San Francisco for

22
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,829
just a few blocks away actually and I
actually just barely relocated here for

23
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,320
this position

24
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,430
loving San Francisco so far only been
here for a month though I am originally

25
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,070
from Utah and I'm I'm really excited
that I got a couple times here in the

26
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,519
room that came out for us a shout outs
americorps Texans old-time thanks for

27
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:19,880
being here guys alright so enough about
me let's talk a little bit about need

28
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,200
help where we work with government and
self-insured

29
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,050
we work with government self-insured
employers understand and improve how

30
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:36,290
people use health care that's the really
vague term exactly what we do that's

31
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:43,570
what Dr wants a say cuz it's on the
website in shorts we're we do data

32
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,820
warehousing and data analytics for
health care very much sums it up

33
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,180
security is the foundation of our
culture and our products and as a result

34
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,190
we like to be very transparent so if you
have any questions at all about new now

35
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,109
our security whatever I'd be more than
happy happy know ask them we got a

36
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,750
couple of the guys here at work here and
they will that we're gonna get out there

37
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:14,470
as well now we're also currently
accepting resumes not necessarily hiring

38
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,829
at this moment but probably will be in a
month or two so I'd be more than happy

39
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,530
to take a look at your resume and some
it if you're interested come pick me up

40
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:29,359
after alright sorry ellen gray gonna go
out that it's it's a shame really is

41
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,790
actually I think they complement each
other very well

42
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:40,460
freaking out on the screen alright how
many with the tempo cents or OS and I

43
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,330
personally don't like talking sense
alright who can tell me what it was

44
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,909
since stands for open source
intelligence what is open source

45
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,000
intelligence without looking at the
screen right there

46
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,660
information available from publicly

47
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,340
permission from publicly available
sources such as social network's public

48
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,890
data records such as your property
records or you're in a lot of states

49
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:23,090
your case records like every time you
get pulled over that is public and some

50
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,599
states have very information that they
share with the public for instance I

51
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,330
believe its arguments that was a little
bit later but believe north dakota

52
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:37,390
actually lasts for the person social so
that's fine if you're from north dakota

53
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:45,150
congressman get that fixed cuz shameful
anyway and customer data there's also a

54
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:51,880
there's a ton of other sources but the
most common form no sense I believe we

55
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:59,780
do it on a day-to-day basis is on
Facebook who who who here has leveraged

56
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:06,469
of cent on Facebook for an ex girlfriend
ex boyfriend but you know maybe a little

57
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:13,260
bit like this girl in stocking you on
Google Earth

58
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,330
how many guys have had a significant
others like this

59
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,890
alright he did tell details later

60
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,130
Wyo sense ok why do we

61
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,950
why do we leverage a lot of people want
to go said they often think of

62
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:37,419
intelligence company as intelligence
agencies and companies such as the NSA

63
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:43,590
FBI CIA or jetstream crap strike the
seven companies stressing that leave us

64
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:50,109
one of the sponsors anyway but private
investigators detectives lawyers

65
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,410
investigative journalists

66
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:57,539
Brian Krebs really good example of this
he is sure everyone here is familiar

67
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,390
with his work is an investigative
journalist and uses a lot of us in

68
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:07,570
criminal activity in law enforcement
also threat intelligence right a lot of

69
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,130
people classify docent at stocking its
not stocking called me in Internet

70
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,960
detective GATT's ok but really it is
kinda stalkerish but be honest

71
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,990
disclaimer so I am in no or there
actually is a big difference between

72
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,130
gathering open source intelligence in
stockings somebody and I meant no harm

73
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,620
advocating docking somebody that is
illegal so

74
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,130
guys want to get to the differences we
can later but a general rule of thumb is

75
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,530
stocking actually intel's physically
following the person now virtually

76
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:52,780
following person icon twitter otherwise
we would all be alright basic workflow

77
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:58,330
for open source intelligence is also
good to me this is this is a general

78
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,479
work for low for any threat intelligence
got identify the source identify

79
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:12,440
possible sources tell what are some good
sources of Intel intelligence ideas then

80
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:18,760
why do you think you could find so much
stuff on LinkedIn

81
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:30,950
ru penetration tester okay awesome how
many guys a penetration test used more

82
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:37,780
but they were let the record show that
there are a hundred hands went up anyway

83
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,478
twitter is one of my favorites Instagram
because of those careless people that

84
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,240
well okay sorry sorry there was a
generalization and very mean they're not

85
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,070
careless some people deliberately put
the G

86
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,630
geo-tagging on their on their posts and
a lot of them have legitimate reasons I

87
00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:03,950
personally don't like doing that anyway
gotta validate you gotta make sure that

88
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,870
it's not like a fake Twitter profile or
it's not a fake profile that's not it

89
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:16,150
just make sure its legitimate right and
then we're gonna go into a little bit of

90
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,620
automation if you're doing all this
manually to give very tiresome the next

91
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,610
step is to analyze so a wealth of
information from LinkedIn and trying to

92
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,990
get home and from Twitter and Facebook
and property records and tax tax records

93
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,320
are public but

94
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,780
anyway you get a wealth of information
but does it really all apply right

95
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,819
there's actually from all the stuff that
you can get a very small percentage of

96
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,630
what you actually gonna collect is going
to apply to your targets then determine

97
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:57,590
the probability you spoke to you if the
price target is really gonna be useful

98
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,760
then apply competence right like I know
for sure this person works at this

99
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:10,960
company right or I'm actually really
like only 50% short or I'm sure I'm 100

100
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,700
percent positive that this is my
employer this is one of my coworkers and

101
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,720
they're tweeting sensitive stuff about
my proprietary code for or are trade

102
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,540
secrets or something like that right and
then from there usually generate new

103
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:36,689
potential for something or it usually
send it usually very long process and

104
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,790
you could be as thorough or has not
thorough as you as you want to be really

105
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:48,390
could spend weeks just interpretation
then you enrich your contacts

106
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,740
probability comments level details and
we develop a narrative this person was

107
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,770
here on this day and they went did this
and based on the geotech Instagram photo

108
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:07,199
they were a part of this crap that's
that's the typical law enforcement or if

109
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,720
you're if you're involved in a corporate
espionage cases also might be useful to

110
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,700
look at the GeoTrax of people's tweets
that might be involved in that and other

111
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,840
possibilities are endless right guys
have ever used

112
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,740
can really see that now to go up and
nice thank you that's like half the room

113
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:34,940
I love Mauti go for those of you for the
yummy because I heard about to go okay

114
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,790
so I'd say just a small percentage of
people in this room but we're gonna go

115
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,550
over exactly what it is just really
quick so it's a leak

116
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:55,210
visualization to open source
intelligence you can email or our

117
00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:02,930
persons name or a social security number
or or Twitter handle or whatever you

118
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,540
want and you could run what are called
transforms on them which are basically

119
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:19,189
just scripts written anything which sees
me and and then she's me then you will

120
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:27,450
slowly get a web entities and
relationships to your investigation some

121
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:33,080
common terms i veri said in to see
indices transforms and machine machine

122
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,350
so what in its two years is these three
history thing is for things are regular

123
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,440
are considered entities amount to go
you'll see right here

124
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,950
reddit.com then you then you got their
name servers right there

125
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,900
those four things are considered
entities then transforms is the thing

126
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,620
that I which is why I like to think
transformed the scripts and it's the

127
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:05,620
transformed I actually ran to look red
its DNS services thank you very much and

128
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,530
the machines are running several
transforms together to develop a big

129
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:16,760
weapon result many guys have ever
developed your own transforms for

130
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,350
mounting we got a couple

131
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:25,390
it's very very easy pretty much you
write the script and Perl Python

132
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:33,430
whatever language you want and then you
throw next few lines of code from

133
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:37,910
Montego chances I promised my personal
favorite from Montego transform transfer

134
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:44,329
import start they basically just make a
class module or whatever you call it I'm

135
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,780
sorry I'm not really probably messing up
the terminology like crazy right now

136
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:53,339
anyway and you just you to support that

137
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,410
and then you have to create an LTO
transform object and then parse the

138
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:08,329
arguments a system arguments and in a
way you go it's a simple as that and

139
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:14,210
then then you got a call and say he got
a call the object returned the output so

140
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:20,660
that it actually takes place on mount
ago so little shameless plug here

141
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:28,230
gavel is about to go transform the brain
and myself we developed just out of

142
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:35,060
curiosity and I'm not expecting many
hands up how many data but chance ok 34

143
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:41,790
hi I expect a few hours so let's get
what it is

144
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,150
court case records from individual
states that I know that I new

145
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:53,170
information is provided for his record
some states are a pain in the actually

146
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:58,279
organized and filed a court case records
by county such as here in California so

147
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,720
you have to develop new transform for
every single one of those counties so

148
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,450
we're in the middle of the night we only
have Maryland and Delaware and I think

149
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,610
maybe another couple states if you are
interested in helping us with this

150
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:18,040
initiative and getting all states
pulling their core case records in

151
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,130
amount to go we would love to help her
go ahead and his about whether it's a

152
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,050
lot of fun

153
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:36,479
get tons of information and there's I'm
sorry there is nothing gets accomplished

154
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,700
Brian we're home slash gavel I let him
take his repo

155
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:58,029
ok so here's an example you'll see in
letting Brian to credit here you'll see

156
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:04,300
his name Brian we're home and we ran
this court case we ran this transform

157
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,359
against his name and we are able to see
that he is associated with those

158
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,200
addresses and those license plates
because he is from maryland and Maryland

159
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,029
does give you the license plate numbers
of the time you were pulled over and

160
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:18,600
whatnot

161
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:28,300
this is dummy data so don't go China
stock Brian I try to anyway

162
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:40,149
questions don't be afraid to set of
questions middle care I i apologize a

163
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:50,589
little bears I'm not familiar with ok we
looked at a couple other sources such as

164
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:57,140
know what was the one that we're looking
at it was this for private investigators

165
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,779
and it had a name that rhymed

166
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:08,040
yes yet like the Nexus and we looked at
a couple other ones yes we do we be

167
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,290
honest with you we can about this
project up all just cuz we had other

168
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,438
things come up in a little more
interesting and stuff but we do to plant

169
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,589
plan on developing it further and we
would love suggestions like that you'd

170
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,589
like to help us reach out to us on
Twitter and we'd love to

171
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:28,059
alright I got a story for you can tell

172
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,260
I'm sorry I'm gonna have to go back to
her her creative people here how many

173
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,720
guys ever seen this there's a whole
Twitter account is there are several

174
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,700
Twitter accounts dedicated to retweeting
pictures that people post their credit

175
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:54,280
cards and some of them might be fake
love the real I do believe this is this

176
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:02,928
is scary how many be seen this I wanted
to shout Danny Howard Zinn medic or text

177
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,570
for this he is he's done a lot of
research on get home is actually

178
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:13,059
speaking of you said salt lake city in a
couple weeks about his research and I

179
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:22,610
still the screenshot from him so thank
you anyway and this publishing sensitive

180
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,409
files such as at the shadow and password
or SSH keys to get her death

181
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:40,360
that'll keep gary mauro so here goes my
story so I was contacted by a university

182
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:49,139
in Utah to speak on house in 10 ml tigue
oh this was for their I T security club

183
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:57,070
as they were they were freshmen senior
enthusiast studying and researching

184
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,320
information security at this university
and they wanted me to do a primary for

185
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,189
them and I thought how cool would it be
to docs somebody

186
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:13,299
users said to embarrass somebody in that
club and reveal anyway so I contacted

187
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:25,490
this girl that I knew that was in the
club I asked her following a sensor just

188
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,960
so you know just a warning I I sense a
lot of these text her

189
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:40,039
I sent him so much that you might like I
could be made but I promise this all

190
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:46,100
really happened anyway so another
coworker and I have been asked to speak

191
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,469
to go with plan during a rather
expensive demo and wanted to see how

192
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,370
much info we could get on someone using
sources openly available on the internet

193
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,129
we were wondering if you would be
willing to be the victim of the demo and

194
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:10,559
she said yeah totally fine she said
there's definitely out there with an old

195
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:18,600
password hashes I put that in because
that ended up doing so we started with

196
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,129
Twitter data because she had something
like tens of thousands of tweets and she

197
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,110
tweeted an average of like 20 times that
is done

198
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:37,250
valuation so so it was really really
good data in she did geotag a lot of so

199
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:44,960
we need a way to parse through all that
so we automated all this year ago we

200
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,950
identified validated and then we're
gonna gonna show you all this process

201
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:58,289
this is the this is the code to the
transport that that we use

202
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:11,610
so this is why it's it's fun so this is
the function that I wrote well I can

203
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:17,610
take full credit if any because you're
familiar with Justin seats at a kind of

204
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,979
in a mentor of mine and I've taken a lot
of ideas for him in some of this code is

205
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,539
his but I have modified to my two
minutes

206
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:37,390
so anyway so Twitter only lets you grab
202 eat at a time right

207
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,310
so this is just going through grabbing
220 keeping track of the idea that we go

208
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,970
back and then when you go to this
function which calls the previous

209
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,810
function that showed

210
00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:01,040
if we keep track that we make sure we're
not going to put it all into list for us

211
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,470
which is nice so we we downloaded on
retreat so go grab two hundred tweets

212
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:12,920
per API call but they only let you
polled the most recent 3200 weeks of a

213
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,580
user so we were able to pull 3220

214
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:22,419
so if anybody so that this is just an
interesting note so if any of your

215
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:28,080
applications have tweaked over 3,200
sweets for a person it's because they've

216
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,679
been pulling him for a long time in
saving them on their own their own

217
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,940
infrastructure and whatnot

218
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:40,220
anyway so we looked at the geotech
information we plotted on a map where

219
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:54,190
you guys think this is this what this
was home this is so that was pretty well

220
00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:00,980
there's like thousands of which is right
there then we wrote this another part of

221
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:07,810
this transform and this interacts with
the Google Maps Google Maps API so I

222
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,919
cannot take credit for this part of all
Brian totally broke this himself

223
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:19,919
part of the transform what it does is it
takes all the longitude and latitude

224
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:27,179
coordinates tweets and its limits and
then Google Maps app side of street

225
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:35,330
address what it does is it returns the
top five street addresses the person was

226
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:41,409
tweeting from we also made so in Montego
you can apply confidence levels

227
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:46,780
depending on how thick the line is that
the line connecting the two entities are

228
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:53,080
sticker that implies that a tire so
that's what we're doing right here and

229
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,668
again this is heavily censored so you
might not believe me but I promise you

230
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:13,460
this is her Twitter handle and those are
the top half anyway then we found that

231
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,830
was anyway we had a blast going
throughout her Twitter data and we're

232
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:23,780
able to just real quick signup back I
will I will tell you guys that one of

233
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,480
these addresses was a home another one
was where she spent most time on campus

234
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:37,890
of a particular school and that's really
scary in that we can and we did that and

235
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,799
all the possible routes that Google Maps
tells you how to get to those places and

236
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:47,450
literally trying soccer right but that
is crossing a line do not cross the line

237
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:54,360
ok and we did not do that and then again
we had documented approval from her

238
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:03,629
throughout this whole process then we
found this I don't see this and tell me

239
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,980
what it is is an unsalted hatch

240
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:20,400
and that's when it comes out we found a
rainbow table online and we were able to

241
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:29,830
crack it well as a shower on salted hash
and then we were like ok the scope of

242
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:37,159
this week again picture so I sent her
another email and I said sorry to keep

243
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,940
bothering you

244
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,280
we just wanted to verify this engagement
how far are we allowed to go we just

245
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,850
made a significant advancement and are
entering a bit of a gray area do you

246
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,178
have any issue with us

247
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:55,410
attempt to log into any of your online
accounts then I further said that we are

248
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,160
going to do any malicious we're just
gonna get into a screenshot prove that

249
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,049
we're there and get it she said go ahead
with the logins I have nothing

250
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:18,668
embarrassing as far as I know exactly
anyways so I have heard of no 1.com know

251
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:22,250
or there's another there's another site
that does a similar thing I can't remove

252
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,799
the name anyway you pop in a user name
right here

253
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:29,700
into the search and then it tells you
all the sites that the user needs taken

254
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:36,590
and she had a very awesome so we went
through that entire list there is much

255
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:44,110
more than he's shown on here and we tend
to log-in on how about half because we

256
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,928
ran out of time we got access to some
stuff

257
00:26:53,130 --> 00:27:04,850
it was expired but got into her credit
accounts or just like that in my reddit

258
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:14,350
account username he has never know
anyway so I mean this is so I love you

259
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:20,790
guys are probably thinking okay so this
is cool DOCSIS girl but how does this

260
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,100
apply to my job at this time

261
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,330
gonna get because I really like

262
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:35,649
applications to things and I'm going to
go with that person and go over exactly

263
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,160
everything that we were able to find and
we really get hurt your home address we

264
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,950
suspected that it was respected what it
was via Twitter but we are also planning

265
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:50,470
a hundred percent confidence level
because we found it in at sea shipping

266
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,150
address

267
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:57,620
be able to find a proxy class locations
where she was and what we really want to

268
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,000
do but we never got around to see if we
could actually determine her school

269
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:09,810
schedule based on what types which
location that was that transform that i

270
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,770
showed earlier where we found that the
salt was transformed written by one.com

271
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:19,680
they have one that integrates about to
go we're gonna find her close friends

272
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,860
who talks with the most software and
Instagram job history LinkedIn Facebook

273
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:29,370
that's not really a huge deal I was able
to find several IP addresses that she

274
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:35,449
users regularly based on her read it
logged history that's a big deal right

275
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:42,790
especially now that that's a little bit
of an application right so when they're

276
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:46,040
ready to count of Blois and see the
office

277
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,639
start attacking that I mean there's
other ways yes

278
00:28:51,750 --> 00:29:08,220
I'm gonna be as big as popular as
possible she was involved the company

279
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:15,330
that did not stop the past I'm sorry
what was that

280
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:25,820
yeah I don't know right she so to her
credit all these accounts she says that

281
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:33,149
she no longer she says she no longer
uses but no its deadly best practice to

282
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:37,260
change that password and not use the
same password cross which she does not

283
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:46,530
do it for all of us any good questions
any other questions now and we are able

284
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:54,050
to find her birth date and where she got
her hair did we are also able to find

285
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,180
some stuff out on her family we got
their addresses and their property

286
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,030
records we will find out how many
members brothers and sisters her age her

287
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:09,580
brothers and sisters ages and other
names and we could have gone a lot

288
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,320
further and done all of this on it each
of them individually and had a lot of

289
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:23,800
data so anyway so let's get into if you
use cases for the Red Team alright you

290
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,419
penetration testers out there what would
you use this information

291
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:36,840
toward social engineering fish all the
things so this is we did try to piss her

292
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:43,720
this is the sad part of the story she
didn't quickly so sad for me as I really

293
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:51,790
wanted her but it was a heads up to her
and we use when we did we took

294
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:57,300
information that we had learned about
her based on her profile and through all

295
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:02,909
that and try to try to get someone out
social engineering

296
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:08,160
only you can prevent social engineering
and she did prevent it

297
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:15,389
that's good so the red seen cases are
these cases are pretty obvious here

298
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,960
right

299
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,930
mentioned earlier that you use LinkedIn
data for investigations definitely also

300
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:28,480
good source right so let's talk about
the use cases for blue team K

301
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:37,550
before I go any further I wanna I wanna
talk about Johnny Cash Johnny Cash

302
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:46,330
fantasies but anyway so this is a very
thin line before you go and planning

303
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,379
anything like this

304
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:55,510
definitely need to consult a chief
privacy officer the CSO need to consult

305
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:59,990
other people just can't start going and
doing this on all your employees because

306
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:06,160
there will be a lot of pushback in this
is a very fine line of privacy ok so I'm

307
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:13,390
not advocating that you guys violating
anybody's privacy but however I do

308
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,780
believe that conducting a cent on some
of your employees will definitely help

309
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:27,550
prevent attacks especially social
engineering attacks ok ok so we could

310
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:31,830
use Twitter to see if there's if
anything that they're talking about is

311
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,899
potentially malicious at the following
competitors that's not really a huge

312
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,760
deal right there were talking with us on
Twitter you know that that might not be

313
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,650
able to talk about your brand right for
him

314
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:53,670
Instagram are they putting pictures
about with the work that is on it would

315
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,450
probably be accidental I don't think
anyone would deliberately

316
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:05,260
maybe but I wanted to post a picture of
my work badge right but I could see

317
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,470
myself doing it accidentally

318
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:13,750
passwords talk about this in that is
there a password or other sensitive

319
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:18,289
information such as a network diagram
drawing on the whiteboard behind them in

320
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:25,720
the picture that they're not aware of
what was the case with the Trayvon

321
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:33,760
Martin case that that the attorney took
his daughter took a picture on their

322
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,760
lunch break it ended up in terminating
him some way

323
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,409
Instagram I'm sorry that was very vague
details but that's all I know but

324
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:44,010
something like that right

325
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:51,129
trouble returns on a lot of research on
this community since the file cabinet

326
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:57,740
proprietary I'm guessing this I just
committed entire code base again that's

327
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:05,150
that's carry on the company due to be
day but committed company info like the

328
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:10,879
directory i've seen that before when I
was participating in a pretty blue team

329
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:18,050
CTF I was on the Red Sea and we found 10
teams get her proposed and had all their

330
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,070
phone numbers right there

331
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:24,589
listen the repo rate so there's there's
some really sensitive information and

332
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:31,379
like I said if you wanna find out more
on how you can check out a couple weeks

333
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:38,319
besides Alex city think you've given the
same topic please write and talk on

334
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:46,940
Facebook is any other public activity
militias friends with better is talking

335
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:52,909
about your brand that something is
Twitter right brand monitoring this is

336
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:58,150
where I think you could be extremely
valuable asset monitoring and this isn't

337
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:06,300
necessarily targeting your employees or
heard of the term a total number of

338
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:11,430
deployed and used gambler you might be
wanting to talk to you a little bit

339
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:19,129
after meeting gambler for those of you
who don't know as a tool and basically

340
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,660
you tell it to go search for stuff
online

341
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:29,118
come back and study began and it
specifically meant to find potentially

342
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:36,160
malicious chatter or leaked data
whatever you want to find out find it

343
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:45,649
correct me if I'm wrong that's
essentially you can monitor your name

344
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:51,490
your brand I think this is going to be
extremely helpful for us where we are a

345
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:58,029
healthcare company we have but load the
data very very sensitive data that I

346
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:02,040
would want to know if somebody's talking
on the dark web about it right about

347
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:13,020
noon I don't wanna know right away so
you can rate your employees I would

348
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,750
imagine that this stuff is a sensitive
stuff that they're gonna post will be

349
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:22,000
accidental let's have a disgruntled
employee or something right and I'm not

350
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
tell and I'm not saying that we should
seller boys know you have a life and

351
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,690
social media that's not what I'm
implying I think we should rate them and

352
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,830
those that are little more talkative
online and they may have a little more

353
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,060
potential to leak sensitive data we
should we should monitor them a little

354
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:53,570
bit closer right that that is a little
closer and then put your sim quietly if

355
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:58,040
you could get if you get intelligence
that there's a tack coming on your

356
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,200
network are you being targeted our
employees being targeted by potentially

357
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:06,029
prevent a social engineer

358
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:12,960
inspect that employees can be targeted
for fishing pull them aside telling the

359
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,860
extra careful with their permission
maybe even their incoming email stuff

360
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:27,720
like that so another shameless plug
interrogator we burning myself and

361
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,029
anyone else who wants to help us we're
gonna be developing a web application

362
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:39,700
that all of us will be continuous
monitoring of your workforce or if any

363
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:46,810
of your private i dooo semana anyone
else right you'll be able to visualize

364
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:50,930
the relationship with the graph database
much like Nazi go except in web or so

365
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:55,779
that users across platforms and we're
hoping to get an initial version out

366
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:03,610
sometime mid 2016 we're hoping to get
the beta version released before besides

367
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:14,240
some other things came up a waiver not
able to real quick touching on what I

368
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,689
was saying about Instagram looking for
objects and photos Just In seats which

369
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:27,160
previously or sites sorry about last
name he has a very active blog at a

370
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,640
meeting I'll send dot com and he
actually talks about finding

371
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,520
he he he researched the geopolitical
type stuff

372
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,140
automatically finding weapons could also
take this article and the practices that

373
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:46,430
he he applies here and find other things
is a great article I would highly

374
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:51,500
recommend it it says part 1 it was
released January is yet to come out some

375
00:38:51,500 --> 00:39:02,310
weed out once it does come out so yeah
just a few recommendations I'm sorry sir

376
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:06,350
question just few recommendations I
highly suggest following

377
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:13,020
Justin seats JMS underscore underscore
pie on Twitter also the truck to go

378
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:21,500
through with the groc he does a lot of
stuff he's pretty brilliant I dot com

379
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:26,940
that's Justin blocked telling chat dot
com so quick

380
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,290
disclaimer about bailing out dot com
they don't they're not security

381
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,080
professionals they are proud they are
private investigators and they more

382
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,319
focus on like geopolitical issues and
and and using satellites to detect

383
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:46,000
armies are moving stuff like that you
see in the movies but it does very very

384
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,940
good idea what we were able to
accomplish

385
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:54,200
probably give you some ideas of how do
your job and save companies but before

386
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:24,569
and it got any questions yes yes and I'm
sure and correct me if I'm wrong please

387
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:33,930
there is no formally released or unless
you wanna pay big bucks to do this right

388
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:37,290
the purpose that we're behind our
interrogator application we plan on

389
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:42,060
developing is to make it more easily
accessible to everyone we're gonna

390
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,299
completely open source the whole thing
right

391
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:51,710
gonna accept request anyone can edit the
code and open to lots of ideas we're

392
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,590
super refugee advocates of open source
software so the idea behind

393
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,999
interrogators to make it more readily
available to every

394
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:06,879
but you're absolutely right it is fairly
trivial things are going to be doing any

395
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:08,009
other questions

396
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:14,159
all right thank you so much guys
bloggers.com appreciate it
