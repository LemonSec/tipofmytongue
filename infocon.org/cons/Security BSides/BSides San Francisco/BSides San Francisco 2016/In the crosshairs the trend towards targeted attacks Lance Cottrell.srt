1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,629
like to remind you provide feedback
about the top there's information on

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,950
your ticket and also the schedule on the
website and I like to introduce next

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,119
speaker well thats she'll be speaking
about in the crosshairs please give a

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:35,460
warm welcome thanks very much for coming
my interest in gardening really comes

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,750
because the last 20 years working in and
then any technology so I sounded

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:54,329
anonymizer dot com back in 95 anonymous
retailers or she is something that's a

7
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,260
lot of time thinking about how people
get recognized how people get and what

8
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:11,320
kind of techniques they can just gonna
have fun with us just one second

9
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,949
get back to screen size where can
actually see things turn off all the

10
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,950
networking

11
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:46,900
want to start up just a general question
obviously did you get an ecard from your

12
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,280
mother on her birthday with her
childhood picture of you on the card and

13
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,080
on the ecard in your email

14
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,630
are you gonna click on that link their
heads shaking know but I think most

15
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,720
people know if you get something that
sufficiently personal look sufficiently

16
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,640
real is the kind of thing you're still
going to engage with your gonna you're

17
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,899
going to click on that because it
doesn't sound an alarm that's what

18
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,670
you're expecting see editor going to
mainstream website me how many of us

19
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,130
start the morning reading CNN or some
other website see what's going on today

20
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,010
most people don't steal nervous about
doing that like this is a pic legitimate

21
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,500
website I'm not in the dark alleys the
internet I feel pretty good about this

22
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,670
because each one of these sites has been
taken over for a watering hole attack

23
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,958
not just in general watering hole attack
actually been used for targeted watering

24
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,000
hole attacks just changes the entire
question the threat level but you're

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,150
dealing with and targeting in its heart
it really good data but it's looking

26
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,970
like a significantly growing threat so
there was a study that was done the

27
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,300
interview a couple hundred companies
they said are you concerned about

28
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,630
targeting not at all somewhat concerned
concerned or it's inevitable and in 2013

29
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,620
28% people said it was either a concern
or inevitable and in 2015 70% the

30
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,660
companies interviewed said darden was
inevitable so it's gone from yeah that's

31
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,570
the thing but most of the threats they
were getting where we're fairly broad

32
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,570
spectrum to really getting you know

33
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:36,359
so this this is a sort of actual
companies in England's but I think the

34
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,490
public generally applies over sixty
percent of the companies surveyed said

35
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,610
that they had been targeted in the
previous year forty percent said that

36
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,420
that was successful 20% lost data in the
process and 15% suffered significant

37
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:56,720
either financial or reputational losses
as a result of that so this is a huge

38
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,230
party people are getting getting
targeted and the Chargers are are

39
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,799
getting into being effective against
them and the two main kinds parting

40
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,680
receive your email

41
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,500
reality is that like that card from your
mother a really well crafted phishing

42
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,149
attack is really affect you know if it's
from the right person it actually comes

43
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,279
from your colleagues email account
because they hacked his computer first

44
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,960
referring to real things it's talking
about in a real situations very

45
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,890
difficult to get people not all that
kind of thing and realistically most of

46
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,700
us have to click to work will get a link
that someone sends you that in fact

47
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,120
although because that's part of your job
you need to get the

48
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:52,180
sounds just like feedback up here's what
we're seeing that with with the email

49
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,860
phishing attacks is a real trend towards
than being fishing links rather than

50
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,800
fishing attachments because we've done a
pretty good job training people not the

51
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,120
QuickTime files when they show up in the
in box that you shouldn't be opening bat

52
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,150
files or suspicious file but I think
people still feel more comfortable with

53
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,229
blanks as overseeing a lot more than
being the links you go to the link then

54
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,680
you get exploited and the browser really
is the problem

55
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,698
sixty-eight percent of all malware is
delivered through the browser over 90%

56
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:27,530
undetected malware comes to the browser
five of the most vulnerable applications

57
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,239
just by patch count are all either
browsers or browser plug-ins

58
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:41,650
got a few guys clearly got time to catch
Norma's applications that huge amounts

59
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:48,030
of capabilities that running into
multiple programming languages most

60
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,309
browsers running something like five
different programming languages inside

61
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:58,599
them this is sort of an impossible to
solve problem but watch targeting well I

62
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:01,780
think it's there's a couple of reasons
why they want to target the first is

63
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,919
just success rate if I get one of these
Nigerian scams no one's going to fall

64
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:13,849
for that you know that that situation
whereas you know with targeting I got an

65
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:18,840
email that says for me I really
appreciate you being here at my time and

66
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,030
I appreciate the questions you're going
to ask questions and here's the copy the

67
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,289
deck and there you go

68
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:31,919
but it wouldn't be so mean the guy
sitting next to you what's your email

69
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,760
address was and so the targeting allows
you to do that social engineering to

70
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,169
make to get that warm fuzzy feeling when
the message comes in because it's on the

71
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,639
right person it's got the right
information that's referencing the right

72
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,870
kind of context job-specific it's built
just for you and so the Oscar clicking

73
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,440
on that

74
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:01,260
be much much higher on the web it works
a little differently but with a web

75
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,120
based hardening their clever in
different ways the first one I want to

76
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,950
talk about was annexed against courts
and some hackers can they took over the

77
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,320
forbes quote of the day go to forums but
that thing comes up they managed to

78
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:21,530
compromise that now where they were
using a couple of different 0 days to go

79
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,239
after the people who website and those
are valuable resources but what they did

80
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,400
was they set it up so that it would only
attack certain people that they wanted

81
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,859
to go after in this case it went after
DOD employees and chinese dissidents and

82
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,440
I really clear about how they were doing
it but it looks like they're doing it

83
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,610
based on IP addresses but only people
Matt matching the criteria they were

84
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:51,170
going after the attack and so that's
great because now he's got a company's

85
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,790
scanning their website looking for
malware looking for a tax making sure

86
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,919
that there's nothing going on the course
that doesn't meet the criteria it

87
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,900
doesn't see the attack happened only the
people who wanted to go after it and

88
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,940
then you send in your friends extend to
go oh yeah I gotta buy this and they

89
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,900
check their website

90
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,750
you know they'll get the attack either
eventually they were able to dig in and

91
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,020
find them all we're sitting there but
it'll be very effective and stay active

92
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,020
for a long time

93
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,640
next and even more targeted attack was
an apt group that was called Dark hotel

94
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:32,199
and they went in and they did a
two-phase attack first they compromise

95
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,330
mostly Asian hotel chains and when at
the reservation systems and they look

96
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,950
for reservations by high-value targets
senior government folks or senior

97
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,920
military senior corporate kind of people
CEO levels and that they realized when

98
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,150
they were going to be staying at the
hotel we know this is gonna be checking

99
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:59,520
in on Tuesday they would then and only
then exploits the white portal and they

100
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,400
go into that and packet has now they
know who is showing up and where it what

101
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,089
room they're staying

102
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,670
well when you reach the captive portal
what two things doesn't ask you may

103
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,389
remember right so then they set it up to
only exploit that one person with that

104
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:21,300
name and remember rancher it would then
harsh and exploit machine these guys are

105
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,920
willing to work hard for it they were
doing a fake windows update with a

106
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,219
science a sign code base because they
brute force 25 well that signing search

107
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:37,069
and there were used properly signed
updates and then the software would sit

108
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:46,059
silent or six months and then it would
exploit you start you know data all that

109
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:50,600
other good stuff so extremely targeted
and took a long time for these guys to

110
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,720
trace down because the malware was only
resident for the short period of time on

111
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,860
the wifi that I was gonna be in the
hotel on the city's they ran the exploit

112
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,370
they actually uninstalled it and can you
send out your friends they don't see any

113
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:15,439
defects you're looking for and the water
but attack they had given another level

114
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:19,089
of slackness in the way they manage
targeting and nothing new there

115
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:26,439
watering hole as a two-faced target so
when you go to the website the first

116
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:30,800
time they grabbed a profile of your
computer a look at what browser what

117
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,689
operating system what plugins do you
have what your IP address they do a

118
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:38,099
browser fingerprint so the capture all
that identifying information

119
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:43,459
blocks and languages the light nuclei
identified that does it again when they

120
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:49,378
come back and then they wouldn't do
anything else so they can get to sit at

121
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,790
their leisure and look at what's your IP
address where you coming from do you

122
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,599
have used to I know who you are
recognized you are you the person I want

123
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,819
to go after and which attacks work on
you and then that's that's true then the

124
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:07,949
next person someone who was up interests
visits the page then they get exploited

125
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:12,319
was something that was almost sure to
work and would only attack that person

126
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:15,729
based on either the process fingerprint
or the source IP address

127
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,880
and i got really hard to track people
and they're able to get in and hit their

128
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,740
targets because they've done the ground
research they know who they're going

129
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,760
after they know the operating system
they know what what this is gonna look

130
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,170
like so we're not talking about general
watering hole attacks this what I

131
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,329
started calling the sniper at the
watering hole because if you're sitting

132
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,089
at a watering hole and you start
shooting every antelope that walks by

133
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:44,290
two things going to happen one hopes are
gonna start running the shooting that's

134
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,860
going on and to their gonna start
noticing all the bodies piled up right

135
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,790
and that's what happens on targeted
watering hole attacks so many machines

136
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,079
so many people you're leading lots and
lots of evidence lying around

137
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,570
ideally what you want to do is you want
to sit back and wait for the white rhino

138
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:08,450
to live because that's the money target
from you know how my away so the game

139
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:13,080
here is to stable radar right the
attacker wants to avoid notice it gets a

140
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,180
lot of wins format right so he delays
check because he's not so many people

141
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,770
it's much harder to notice the attack
you don't see it doesn't show up an

142
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,240
anomaly detection because you're not
getting a thousand exploited machines

143
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,040
getting three exploit it and of course
there's a numbers game the more machines

144
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,439
someone tries to hit the better the odds
of you being able to recognize because

145
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,660
the odds are lower

146
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:44,339
they can now also afford to use the
better tools so that's why with for

147
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,270
example attack they were willing to use
a couple of 20 days in their 30 days are

148
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,920
costing them in 066 figures plus to buy
on the open market they don't want to

149
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,949
then have that burned in 24 hours by
using the targeted approach they can

150
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:06,810
avoid allowing that technique having you
know the the signatures created having

151
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:11,670
everyone's intrusion detection now aware
of the techniques they're using and

152
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:17,149
going after it so by being very careful
about all the attacking the one you were

153
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:22,950
able to avoid that section we can also
do more damage with a targeted attack

154
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,900
because the groundwork you can lay ahead
of time if I'm trying to exploit

155
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,010
thousands of people I guess

156
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,970
thousand desktops I have no idea who
they are where they are

157
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,780
what company they work for what
resources they might have access to

158
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,060
where I'm going after just in the
process

159
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:47,510
I'm gonna work out you know what what do
you have going after you have access to

160
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:53,140
some particular piece of data got money
you got some sort of resource I know

161
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,490
that going in I know what I want to get
I can go directly to that and I know

162
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,530
what I'm gonna do with that I've already
worked out how to monetize this asset

163
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:06,000
that i'm gonna get or I've got a whole
campaign laid out to dump all your

164
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
emails on pastebin in a certain way to
do the maximum amount of reputational

165
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,020
damage whatever I'm gonna do that I can
make a lot more as an attacker because

166
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,720
I've been able to plan this out in
advance because I know who I'm going

167
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,970
after so are you a target wellman
obviously very high profile individual

168
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:29,650
your target Obama target you know your
company but do you have access to

169
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,199
valuable paid up maybe a slob your slept
with the keys to the kingdom that's that

170
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,510
that certainly makes you Aventuras do
you have access to the data might not be

171
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,840
valuable obviously but it may be
something to do something with this is

172
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:50,620
this is one always think about there was
an attack on PR Newswire see her with PR

173
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,710
Newswire they do their press release
company under press releases in a

174
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,520
plastic bunch of places like could get
less valuable than a press release it's

175
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:05,750
designed to be sent to every country
except their embargo most of the press

176
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,760
releases you upload it and the press
release get sent out in six hours or in

177
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,680
two days or something like that so they
hacked PR Newswire they grab all the

178
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,000
press releases while they were under
embargo find out which ones had

179
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,030
interesting news that like the stock
price of companies and then had a lot of

180
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:28,290
people that would then trade on the stop
and they need hundreds of millions of

181
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:36,290
dollars using this technique with these
people all over the country to access to

182
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,640
money obviously like money

183
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,410
access networks this target tax can't
get direct access to target

184
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,879
its network you go out company that does
their HVAC and get access to their

185
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:52,279
network that way so it if you have
access to a network which is of interest

186
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:56,850
that may target access to people I think
when you look at the phishing attacks

187
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,199
that really work there the personalized
one you know the guy wanna go after and

188
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,040
I know you know the guy I want to go
after I may exploit you just get access

189
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,540
to your email account so I can learn
about the right email and send it from

190
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,939
your computer right that's a huge win
and and it makes so much more difficult

191
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,259
to train someone well enough to
recognize a phishing attack when it

192
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,769
actually is on your friends account
talking about the fishing vacation

193
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:24,500
YouTube last week and you know
everything else and they they go after

194
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:32,670
looking so that we can sit there looking
for that starting choice so can we can

195
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,029
you prevent the targeting from happening
to you on the web

196
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:43,339
yeah this is sort of my my core
expertise is doing this so you can

197
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:48,279
delete your cookies you can hide your IP
address you can scrub the persistent

198
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:54,490
trackers try to get rid of the super
cookies can master browser fingerprint

199
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:00,540
browser fingerprints the tricky one
because it turns out basically uniquely

200
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,109
identifying of your browser just looking
at what you've installed on your posture

201
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,799
plugins and everything else it's enough
data points for most websites to

202
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:16,849
uniquely identify everyone else for that
my recommendations VPN virtual machine

203
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:21,879
said you got absolutely brand new
pristine p.m. with a browser never

204
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,850
installed anything and no plugins no
extra that generic a fingerprint as you

205
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:30,770
can generate and therefore gives the
least information and identifying

206
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,080
capability

207
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,889
emails way worse because it's a two-way
communication medium so you actually

208
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:43,260
need to give someone an address which
will reach you so if you wanna be

209
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,110
anonymous use an address which doesn't
have anything to do with your identity

210
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,428
or your child and be very careful about
to give that out this becomes basically

211
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,559
like running in all Elias you're not
windy

212
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,950
cover all the time and it's hard to do
business and deep cover so the problem

213
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:05,639
targeting an email I think it's somewhat
intractable but doing it for web dealing

214
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:10,139
with these these targeted on snipers
watering hole scenarios that's a that's

215
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:13,139
achievable if if kind of pain

216
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:21,139
what does it mean for defensive strategy
how do we need to be thinking about you

217
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:30,309
know now that we know we got the target
I love this curtain for thinking

218
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:40,809
differently so there's also some of the
people all all the time

219
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:43,999
can't fool all the people all of the
time really isn't relevant to the

220
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:47,480
attacker they don't care right people

221
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:55,190
time they can train your way out of this
you know there's just enough whatever

222
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,610
and just see no was not a good choice
either you can opt out of the internet

223
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,519
you can choose not open the attachment
from your boss just because it might

224
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:08,659
contain malware you know when you know
you're being told to go open this thing

225
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:11,659
to do something with it so

226
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:21,600
with targeted attacks detection those
targeted attacks are the ones that are

227
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,199
going to do the most damage because they
thought about targeting these things in

228
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,039
place but simultaneously this is the
time when they're comfortable using

229
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,480
those 0 days and the the brand new
exploit they built in the tools that

230
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,289
they haven't used anywhere else because
they are the least likely to be detected

231
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:45,700
using them to the longest possible time
so you call for next-generation security

232
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:53,490
whatever that I gotta be getting toward
security against unknown attacks and has

233
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:59,809
no email yet will happen will not detect
it and building systems that mean that

234
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:05,600
you dont lose everything just because
you got infected you got something

235
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,799
instant automated recovery whether or
not you just making sure each cycle all

236
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:17,289
the time and content management position
I think we're starting to see a lot of

237
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:21,679
companies doing these sorts of tools
where the application is gonna get it

238
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,190
exploded runs inside some sort of a
virtual machine it's it's and blocks

239
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,340
away from other things so that when that
happens it doesn't get to run away and

240
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:35,570
destroy the rest of your networking and
steal all your data and use resistant or

241
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,850
intolerant designed just because you
can't trust users are kind of quick

242
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,990
things are going to open links they're
gonna share things are gonna pass to all

243
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,220
the things that we keep telling me not
to do

244
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,720
ideally want to make sure that just
because someone's a human being doesn't

245
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,960
mean that you know you automatically
corporate security I really like the

246
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:02,450
idea of isolation isolating applications
from the desktop applications from the

247
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,710
network making sure that when the
malware attacks that application it

248
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,250
doesn't then get the pivot and do other
things it doesn't get to go from the

249
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:16,830
browser to the email from the browser to
the files keeping that and also in the

250
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:23,480
network and it's really easy to write a
little JavaScript that will use

251
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,510
WebSockets to enumerate the internal
network of your target without even

252
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,570
exporting browser right they just look
at the page and it goes and scans all

253
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,189
the IP's a local network that would look
like these cases cancel the IP's return

254
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:42,100
back information about it I want to go
after that so isolating both the desktop

255
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,969
and the network I think it's critical
otherwise you just learn them to go look

256
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:51,270
around for soft underbelly and I like
you a lot for this so the same way it

257
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,150
helps with identity protection and
anonymity it also helps with this kind

258
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,860
of isolation but you can you can put the
box and as soon as you're done

259
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:06,419
the box down the next time you need a
reference image you got rid of all the

260
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,080
malware and all that's gone

261
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:16,189
makes the restores really quick and easy
and you can keep small problems often

262
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:23,050
that one you'll start virtualizing the
whole desktop VDI solution but now you

263
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:27,220
just move your whole problem in the
cloud to compromise the BDI then I get

264
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,990
all your data you want to keep the box
can get compromised as small as you can

265
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:36,580
see the damage they can do to the stuff
and that minimize you know if they

266
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,070
compromise your browser they only get
the browser and only the stuff done in

267
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:45,810
the browser this session to go get email
on the rest of the systems and then just

268
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:50,280
making sure that the rebuild process
happens whether or not you don't want to

269
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:56,879
say I'm gonna wait until I see now we're
in this box to launch my story what's up

270
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,280
to every time you close tab close the
browser every time you finished your

271
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,149
email

272
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,110
down start again because there might
have been some now wearing air and

273
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:10,100
wouldn't know you can't count on having
just from an architectural part of you

274
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,320
trying to reduce the amount of data
that's floating around when I was doing

275
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:22,439
started anonymizer are the prime
directive was he will not about you or

276
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,630
your use

277
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:29,730
existing stolen if it's got lots of any
kind of data at all it could get out

278
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,060
there where did you design the
architecture for beginning to not have

279
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,669
that kind of information than that or
you know government can come along and

280
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,440
do you what they're doing to Apple and
insisting you try to reverse engineer

281
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,040
things out the back door not there you
know you don't have those kind of leaks

282
00:23:47,040 --> 00:24:03,820
so that's all the time I got it thanks
