1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,490
alright everyone good afternoon on a
public road you're on Twitter I go by

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,639
angry Hobbit talk a little bit about
wives all snake oil and that that may be

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,590
ok so any vendor sales people in the
crowd good you're not gonna like me very

4
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,090
much so

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,400
manager disclaimer using my own they
don't represent the views of my employer

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,590
my employer doesn't even know I'm here
they'll get to find out when the YouTube

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,390
video that'll be interesting so why are
we here we're here because frankly most

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,879
him secretary or not they just kind of
fell into whether they were enthusiasts

9
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,949
some have supported education some not
the computer scientists get a lot of

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,160
computational theory computational
technique while so let me know if you

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,269
ever been part or heard this discussion

12
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:00,250
welcomes any says reaches are just
costing us too much we can report it so

13
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,479
slick willie contractor comes book that
I and he says hey come by our next gen

14
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,010
box full of zero day detection right we
start to get a little bit hole right

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:23,810
really you can detect 0 days do it boss
holy Detecto days really I met with 12

16
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,330
marketing speak with a bunch of cute you
technology that you don't understand it

17
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,259
doesn't really explain with the product
does

18
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,630
we give them more money and then a
couple of months later

19
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:45,850
and apt comes along and that's what our
network looks like so I went to a bunch

20
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,830
of vendor websites preparation for this
talk I found all of this great language

21
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,179
can somebody tell me what any of this
crap means is not a tells me what the

22
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:02,290
product does or how the product works so
this good-looking guy right here is a

23
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,530
guy named Alan Turing some of you may
have seen a really bad mood with him

24
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,000
recently

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,770
Alan Turing basically came up with them
at that is the basis for all the

26
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,550
computers that run all over them and
attorney machine is just an abstract

27
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,760
machine used in mathematics to prove
fundamental limitations on mechanical

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,160
computing this is how I predict your
problem can't be solved by computer and

29
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,670
something is said to be turning complete
if it's theoretically capable of

30
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,570
expressing all attest accomplished by
computer security computer scientist you

31
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,989
get to spend a wonderful semester
learning something called atomic oh it

32
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:43,920
is really painful math notation but what
it really is a field of screams Matt

33
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,140
that studies computers in the problems
that can be solved by them

34
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:55,268
amor portly the problems that cannot be
solved by them ever so very generic

35
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:00,320
terms of Thomas problems into three
categories sorry there sold easy

36
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,650
intractable meaning that their heart and
we have to make a lot of assumptions or

37
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,610
they're undecided and therefore
impossible you will never ever ever be

38
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,980
able to solve these problems the
computer they're just not talk about an

39
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:22,030
intractable problem with computer to do
something called the traveling salesman

40
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,000
problem

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,340
fairly straight forward given a list of
cities and distances what is the

42
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,299
shortest possible route to visit each
city exactly once and then returned to

43
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:37,700
the originating city but it turns out
that computers as intractable problem

44
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:43,839
and you're running time is a factorial
of the number of cities so imagine that

45
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,600
your sales bending you gotta go from San
Francisco

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,150
York that is a ton of cities the Sun
will burn out before the computer find

47
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,780
you the optimal solution now somebody
out there to get ready to throw the BS

48
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,910
black and they're going to tell me that
sounds a lot like my GPS works and

49
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,210
you're right it is how your GPS works
but your GPS works because it makes a

50
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,390
bunch of assumptions it assumes things
like interstates are festooned in rural

51
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,450
routes will root for faster than farm
roads and then you may tell us some

52
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,029
things like hate don't show me any toll
rose sometimes these assumptions are

53
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:26,940
good but not optimal solution was not
well in the security World NOTW means

54
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,710
you're gonna have type 1 and type 2 airs

55
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,830
false positives or worse yet also niggaz

56
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,290
Baldwin intractable problems talk about
contradictions to certain problems are

57
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,330
mathematically proved to be undecidable
and cannot be solved by computers again

58
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,740
ever so often times general come to us
and they will make assumptions are made

59
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,880
claims that they have solved a bit
difficult problems here said you have

60
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,360
let's assume that they have let's take
them at their word and imagine that we

61
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,770
can take their solution that they're
trying to save you so you and package it

62
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:12,490
into a check if we didn't use that chip
to solve a provably undecidable problem

63
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,500
we've got a contradiction and if I can't
solve that undecidable problem than they

64
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,300
have solved the problem they suggested
that they canceled so there's no holding

65
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:35,190
problem or gift card machine and
language W my pictures missing very

66
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,750
confused baby alright let's try to
destroy the English additional halting

67
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,260
problem here's what it says very simply
given an arbitrary computer program and

68
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,340
you will never be able to determine with
a computer that will finish running and

69
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,830
logically this very straight port it's
either gonna finish or it doesn't and

70
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,529
the problem comes in when it does it
finish if it doesn't finish

71
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:04,129
maybe it's still running or maybe it's
stuck in an infinite loop and you will

72
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:08,849
never know what may decide to break the
program after 30 days but what if it

73
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:13,099
needed 30 days one minute to finish
processing you're never gonna know and

74
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:20,789
that's the problem let's get back to our
vendors vendors gonna come to us we

75
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:30,869
detect all 0 days and what we what we
hear is we detect all 0 days alright

76
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:35,229
let's assume that sure per minute let's
take that 0 detector let's put in the

77
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:41,248
ship a chip let's put in a halting
problem and then let's redefine halting

78
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,029
problem this way if it's a zero day

79
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:49,049
fault and if it's not a zero day we
won't halt so we saw the halting problem

80
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:54,558
but we can solve the halting problem at
all ever mathematically provable

81
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:59,369
hundred-percent so if you get sober
halting problem and I can use your chips

82
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:03,099
all my halting problem you have to solve
your problem either so there is no zero

83
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:12,929
day detection and there will be a right
to know detection alright so how to

84
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:17,229
vendors claim this well the claim that
because it can detect some 0 days and

85
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,659
some of them can they got some really
smart people at work these vendors and

86
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:24,739
they do it using signatures and
heuristics and statistical models and

87
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:29,089
yeah you can detect some things like Rob
chains on occasion but you're not going

88
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:33,979
to detect all of the assumptions to
reduce the problems facing the they can

89
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:38,799
solve the problem so the trick as a
customer is to ask them what assumptions

90
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:43,399
they made and then validate those
assumptions how are you doing what you

91
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:46,999
are claiming that you're doing what
assumptions did you make hello make sure

92
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:55,349
that they make sense in my real world so
about tcp/ip you're gonna get going to

93
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,049
show up and talk about their
next-generation firewall and they can

94
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:03,688
detect all malicious traffic tcp/ip
turns out tcp/ip is also turned complete

95
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:08,129
since its turn complete the halting
problem applies to the halting problem

96
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,610
applies they can't detect almost traffic
and

97
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,629
tcp/ip so that next product it may make
things better but it's not a panacea and

98
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:23,360
it's just gonna have different kinds of
signatures and dearest so the vendors

99
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,849
first be honest your claims your
customers aren't stupid we're going to

100
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:33,578
challenge you ask you about your
something and methodologies they're not

101
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:36,880
secret sauce you need to be able to
explaining and if you're uncomfortable

102
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,899
with that then have a sign an NDA most
of us again be fine with that and for

103
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,630
goodness sakes quit selling US marketing
speak at NextGen cloud enabled

104
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,910
software-defined heuristic based
virtualized threat centric multi-layer

105
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,189
and then and analytics and app to side
of the fence isn't worth the shiny paper

106
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:03,130
you printed on super the customers the
vendors do have some smart solutions

107
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:08,029
that they also need to make a living if
the claim seems too good to be true it

108
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:11,360
probably is so ask him how they're
solving these impossible problems

109
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,140
asked him how they're reducing the
problem space asked him what assumptions

110
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,040
they made and then make sure that those
things make sense in your operational

111
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,319
environment most importantly arm
yourselves little knowledge understand

112
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,470
what problems are not solvable by
computers in which problems are solvable

113
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:36,470
better hard so the next time it comes to
you with broader that Odom you later

114
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,690
asked him how they saw the halting
problem for those who attended our

115
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,649
sector grr SEC bingo cards were their
sales turns I am NOT responsible if you

116
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,890
die of alcohol poisoning while playing

117
00:09:50,890 --> 00:10:00,819
are there any questions I do not have
pony some of my graphics didn't make it

118
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,820
any other questions

119
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,359
resuming thank you very much time
