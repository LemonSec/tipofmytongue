1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
wanna thank our sponsors again

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:10,139
feedback feedback are on the schedule
for the talk you can click on the

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,768
feedback survey button we have one final
raffle at the end the day some $250 gift

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:23,670
card and a gift card to put your name
and the box about jim also otherwise

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,760
this is James Madison from list he deals
with product left in his fraud detection

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:44,250
and real-time trust decisions so few
besides events before speaking from

7
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:51,469
tests I'm here I'd start by introducing
myself a little bit like I don't really

8
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:56,620
have secured backgrounds such just as a
keen interest like a lot of security

9
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:04,289
forces and things I'm more of a general
software engineer and my interests tends

10
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,950
to be around to nose slightly arcane and
unusual systems so I worked in the

11
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,710
travel industry for a few years and I
don't know anyone here is familiar with

12
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,990
airline GPS systems there's a kind of
weird booking systems that book seats on

13
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,970
flights things like that to the payment
processing systems are of interest among

14
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,789
some reason I kind of 10 slightly
painful and faces of interesting to work

15
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:36,210
with so nice recent violence has been at
least I think they're now mostly work on

16
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,210
payments processing a little bit of
fraud detection

17
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,700
so I'm gonna be a little bit about those
mics pants in terms of battling through

18
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,740
it I'm gonna speak a bit about how can
influence is arranged their their

19
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,179
operations little bit of history behind
you know looking back to Boulder

20
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:04,250
dot-com companies ten years ago I'm
going to try and do a few parallels for

21
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:20,959
kind of discussion with traditional
computer security in IC fraud asset type

22
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:29,030
of attire its financial exploit rather
than get access to a nationwide 800

23
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:35,380
services but I think for a lot of
similarities between those two your

24
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,470
business whatever it is you have some
kind of attack servants you know whether

25
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,970
you're processing transactions of South
whether you're filling orders for the

26
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:55,260
people there are ways to target in fact
that operation and essentially any any

27
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:02,870
way to render goods render services
without payment is gonna be financed

28
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,900
baby Kaylee reach you know when you when
you gonna find you might even not notice

29
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,680
it until you really have problems with
with attacks

30
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,660
these are the kind of things that people
will look out for on they will try to

31
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,109
propose in Europe

32
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:32,070
is this is a very adversarial such
situations like myself the team I we're

33
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:39,170
trying to identify and against these
attacks using whatever signals we have

34
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,929
implementing new systems and practices
to try to close down an existing

35
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:53,470
loopholes are known you know it's a bit
like pregnant systems that the other

36
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:59,470
side of things that kind of red team
side of things we're trying to figure

37
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,430
out where the mighty jets where the
mighty weaknesses and try to attack and

38
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:22,400
also had some of the people out here are
are quite sophisticated like there

39
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,530
should consider the possibility of their
even things like malware or virus

40
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:38,080
software trends for your actions so it's
it's not just some random people using

41
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,450
stolen credit cards

42
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:56,120
it can be quite sophisticated the tights
and socks these guys so that's probably

43
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,979
could have you heard about so this is
from a description of the target credit

44
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:09,150
card for each of the seven years ago I
like this diagram illustrates that

45
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,270
there's a whole

46
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,640
organizational pipeline what's going on
here it's not it's not just a case of

47
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,729
you know some people broke into the
target somehow I always try to console

48
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:25,030
him as one of those one single operation
you know there's a there's a real

49
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,280
process of sourcing cards from places
whether it's things like 10 of skimming

50
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,940
whether it's breaking staged basis
actually getting pulled onto credit card

51
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,570
numbers with personal information is a
big thing around not just a card numbers

52
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:48,610
and then those furniture model lol
they'll go on internal testes odds

53
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,060
trends worked out how much value is
available on each other credit cards

54
00:05:52,919 --> 00:06:00,510
whether you know whether the cards are
still valid whether any of the stolen on

55
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:06,780
an entire market places where you can go
online some some in the black car while

56
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,479
some available via tour etcetera but
somewhere you can just log on and

57
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:19,770
download purchase on credit cards and of
course is finally gone to get used in

58
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,219
and purchase is often for high-value
electronic goods things going on

59
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,070
elsewhere and results for four real I
think the example here includes parts

60
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,260
and prepaids kind of difference which
are also good weight so very good value

61
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,260
from credit cards

62
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:52,539
my do or say but this is serious
different types of frauds credit card

63
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:58,180
sort in particular this is reported by
the UK Credit Card Association so they

64
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,910
do a good job of breaking down

65
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,930
different types of credit card loans so
these are things like charge present

66
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,830
which is the vast majority of online
transactions where the physical card

67
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:22,849
holder in the cards are not things like
reputation or creating credit cards and

68
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:26,259
a few other types of tack that the thing
I would note here it is

69
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,770
vetoed my spine creasing and heading up
to the right that is the Cardinal

70
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:37,030
presence of that stuff online
transaction fraud so the interesting

71
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,119
thing here is a lot of this post dates
the introduction of chip and pin in the

72
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,169
UK sometimes also called DMV so this is
basically the peers in your credit card

73
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:57,799
transactions so as you can see that
seems to be helping with physical

74
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,150
transactions by the cards is available

75
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,859
looks like they seem to be staying
fairly steady but what's really happened

76
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:12,580
here is doctor pressure against pros to
push stocks rose in Sioux on line 10

77
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:18,280
something use the credit card details we
are starting to see a few merchants

78
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,049
introducing second factor authentication
online so you may have seen sometimes

79
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,320
you can approach tends to your PIN code
or some other information on the web

80
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,578
that's gonna start to help there but for
the moment the fact that literally is

81
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,260
just a card number and a few other
details which are supposed to be

82
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,260
somewhat difficult to obtain algeria's

83
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:45,029
if a credit cards source from a database
there's a decent chance tailor their own

84
00:08:45,029 --> 00:09:02,699
side once it's a bit of history like how
did we get to where we are just now we

85
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:08,829
now have a situation where I have quite
a bold and amateur business pipeline

86
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:19,399
lot of good advice out there about how
to best practices for how to avoid what

87
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:29,009
was the background what are the things
let's see where we are going to have a

88
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:36,420
story to tax really rely heavily on the
BTU of online merchants son of late

89
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,420
nineteen nineties still fairly

90
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:46,009
continues things transacting with credit
cards online e-commerce wasn't wasn't

91
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:51,329
big deal we maybe hadn't seen many
examples of Taylor's of problems and

92
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:56,329
power so there's some classic things
like just not having very good charity

93
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:04,920
in a database no not not treating us as
a first data I think ahead to current

94
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,069
day if at all possible I would say you
read you really shouldn't be storing any

95
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:12,819
credit card information if you can
possibly avoid services like stripe in

96
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:17,009
Braintree do a great job of letting you
pass on the job of organizing and

97
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:20,009
storing sensitive data elsewhere

98
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,040
really doesn't limit the amount of stuff
you can do a service you can still

99
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,559
transaction value you can still do any
of the things you'd be able to do by

100
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,990
hooking up to a fully-fledged

101
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:39,769
process but it reduces risk another
example

102
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:47,780
early naivety here would be services in
which the systems and the card

103
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:53,480
processing systems are just so a user
places an order fulfillment system kicks

104
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,500
and within a few hours you got some
groups in the country and yet you have

105
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,370
charged the credit card so you don't
even know if that's going to succeed

106
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:10,220
order to get the client's so it seems
like an easy thing you know that was a

107
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,880
classic taxes

108
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:22,080
trial these cards all kinds emergency
which ones to get some thing is I think

109
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,040
there are a few limitations with the
verification systems the cards companies

110
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,240
themselves expose there are there are
standards to the inside they provide

111
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:43,540
documentation about ABS systems but it's
the transportation thanks you so these

112
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:51,150
will be things like check these check
that your name possibly matches against

113
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,959
the card although much luck with see
also check things like the street

114
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:04,110
address its registered this is good
stuff from reading a lot of the

115
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,570
documentation about this like it's it's
not it's not a super easy to use thing

116
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,570
and I i think you know

117
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,750
they don't blame but there's an elements
of hurdles overcome using those kind of

118
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,980
things which I can look at what size are
available at home now things are easier

119
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:37,760
to find a point there I think there is a
lot to the reputation or trust accounts

120
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,029
for a long time so one of things you
really need to do is make sure that when

121
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:48,810
you have user accounts you're you're
keeping track cause how many sort of

122
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,510
payment methods to the Scout has the
user successfully added a couple of

123
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,399
credit cars have a failed to add ten
different credit cards like that would

124
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,720
be a big black there and I think in the
early days people maybe do a great job

125
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:19,209
of storing trust and so that's great you
know let's say we reduced our having

126
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:23,560
these accounts where results are
verified information about user

127
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,060
we're not going to check markets and so
we we know that everything's ok with

128
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:40,380
payments there are still essentially
polls classic attack which seems well is

129
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:47,459
a good account is the best verified
information that you have available

130
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,130
trying get that kind of going to a good
state where its trusted by the system

131
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,269
and at that point at which point you'll
start to use some of the

132
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,199
stolen or otherwise acquired like credit
cards maybe use other than a payment

133
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:07,849
mechanisms trying trying to use that
account so I get some servants so

134
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,980
something I'd recommend areas basically
you know you have to treat any any

135
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:19,230
attempt new payment information or any
action with that you have to be careful

136
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:25,139
maybe some of the same amount checks
certainly a new payment insurance run

137
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:30,060
all those same kind of our nation's you
generally should consider kind of

138
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:36,899
degrading values were times for a long
time then you might want to be a little

139
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:47,720
bit more skeptical of the state's about
cancer

140
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:56,029
little bit more detail about what
happens these these goods so obviously

141
00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:00,220
this doesn't quite small businesses you
know many businesses provides online

142
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,449
services transportation to be an example
but it if you are shipping on physical

143
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:12,479
goods things to watch out for is
shipping so I'm a bit of a story from

144
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,110
PayPal a colleague of mine he was only
PayPal when it was first of all hang on

145
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,000
I think they're they're really good
source of a lot of early stories for

146
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,660
days on end payments so they identified
they don't always require delivery

147
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,509
addresses on their accounts but what
they did start to discover from the

148
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:39,720
address information they did how is very
big clusters

149
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:45,509
fraudulent dresses things where
transactions would be charged that the

150
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:58,639
use of words or basically sort of
results and other transactions fighters

151
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,889
shipping services lot of these are
legitimate but they will receive goods

152
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:13,970
on your behalf of the dresses some of
the International well on so it can be

153
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,920
pretty tricky particularly PayPal now to
use things like so this is an example of

154
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,740
how they it's a signal from from the
real worlds they they found something

155
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:30,569
that allowed them to clamp down on these
transactions I recognize you know there

156
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:34,050
are times when that is legitimate
business so it's not a perfect solution

157
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:41,859
for them and for their bottom line that
helped them down and I think I want to

158
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,329
cities and particular around the
US-french there now it's very difficult

159
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:50,500
to transits a power to your destination
is one of those cities just

160
00:16:52,570 --> 00:17:03,970
interests and see how it stacks of old
to see results of this the highlights

161
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:11,890
talks here is in relations for reshaping
so if if you know that you're not gonna

162
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,480
be able to take kids told these dresses
all locations

163
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,930
was a hospital worker and you can use so
in a couple of soda tax for people

164
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,220
started doing is actually recruiting

165
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,660
meals so these people you know just with
everyday street addresses will receive

166
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,260
those dudes and then I'll be up to them
to actually either physically take those

167
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,930
goods or email themselves to some other
destination so it's basically a way to

168
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:46,220
work around those address address
limitations there's a pretty good story

169
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:52,810
air parcel Express is the name of one
company that's pretty good report by our

170
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:58,040
say which has such a good story as an
example

171
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,330
once housed in a flexible delivery
options let's say where companies like

172
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:19,620
Amazon which also his moments we do want
to enable things like same day delivery

173
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,520
we want our multiple addresses on tennis
things we do to deal with this and also

174
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,660
scale this week we we need to be able to
perform and millions of transactions per

175
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,340
day

176
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:40,570
can stop what they in so many others to
you is to build trust level so take all

177
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:46,178
of those accounts or uses how I can
ensure you can do as much up front

178
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:51,429
possible to verify information about the
billing address information about those

179
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:55,059
cards other user activity as well is
valid

180
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:00,850
how did the user sign up for an account
do they tend to use discounts

181
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,459
is there anything abnormal about the way
that they used sites on service today

182
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:13,450
tensions over 21 address one or two
addresses basically any signals come up

183
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:19,570
with which which might help determine
different types of behavior collect all

184
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:25,639
lawyers and then to build trust levels
starting to look a little bit towards

185
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:32,390
machine learning and things which will
scale more than any human hi rules 44

186
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,390
issues

187
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,520
one of the things I dot there as well as
I i havent talked to create chargebacks

188
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,990
chargebacks will be reported to you by
your payment processor or whatever

189
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:52,480
services and it's very much worth
reading about chargebacks into these

190
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:00,360
models they're very expensive to use
someone charges back on a credit card

191
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,300
transactions made to them not only will
you not get revenue for the transaction

192
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,669
which occurred in the first place but
also you often have to pay an additional

193
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,429
phone

194
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:15,779
and this is a common technique that
people will use to try to pay for

195
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:29,539
something so we're now

196
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:35,889
girls where we've got a lot of stuff on
demands and I like real-time services

197
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:42,758
out there so what's it gonna take my
think about what is really two different

198
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:49,499
here you know what was actually changed
the situation so honest soul asylum the

199
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:55,320
way we pay two things doesn't mean
behind a great deal has really changed

200
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:01,149
is that time duration between it could
even be someone signs are installed

201
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:06,959
users that tour of some kind of service
straightaways that time we can be very

202
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,549
short set something to consider

203
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:15,710
we also have much higher expectations on
behalf of the user so people expect to

204
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:23,220
receive service right away they tend not
to like section like the fewer details

205
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:34,629
you are required to ads better in some
sense there is there is better

206
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:36,879
information available in certain zones

207
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:40,469
a little bit more eyes and see like you
can argue that we're now using mobile

208
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:45,479
devices which have some level of
high-density touch i think thats

209
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:52,369
Township by the tax to knows your
identity on devices virtual devices

210
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:58,639
special occasions so we need to be a
little bit cautious spare parts is

211
00:21:58,639 --> 00:22:05,369
certainly true that in some sense we
might have more information but the big

212
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:11,158
risk of course we have learned kind of
decision time which region either

213
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,159
approve or deny a given service

214
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:31,080
assumptions so we can assume that forces
our resort towns so if they want to do

215
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,129
more sophisticated attacks they are
going to need an effect numbers of the

216
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,279
news

217
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:42,909
potentially even take devices plans how
effective virtual devices are they may

218
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:48,200
need email addresses ending in Europe
the service verification steps in using

219
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,110
their there may be other things other
barriers that you can put up to increase

220
00:22:54,110 --> 00:23:00,979
the cost of the other thing that we very
good is we don't really know what our

221
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:08,750
exposure from various transactions so if
your shipping goods electronics could

222
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:15,120
top $100 worth you you know what the
potential cost to you is if you if you

223
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,178
lose the shipment to Spears so we can
use that to balance the cost for

224
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:25,480
replying to you know how difficult we
make it to them set up an account first

225
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,230
as one of the risks to US lets us very
useful tradeoffs bills make

226
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:38,668
we can assume that it is it is somewhat
difficult to kind of clear twice

227
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:44,209
identity is certainly not a lot of
hospital again depending on how

228
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:48,759
sophisticated the groups of attacking
you are you may see various levels of up

229
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:59,499
for a lot of the ground level so it is
true that you will see prices and also

230
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:04,059
with the kind of dudes examples
previously in many cases you can still

231
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:09,729
just charge from you know if the user is
making a reservation for something a few

232
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:16,139
days ahead then you can go ahead and run
a transaction now and then you then

233
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:26,928
you're not taking on any other risks
like Asians so I've seen as being very

234
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:28,929
very faxes and services

235
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:33,869
combating undertaking forward is to
build relationships so

236
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:40,089
databases are perfect for this what we
what we really care about this situation

237
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:46,519
is we care about the relationships of
$0.03 teens in our our service includes

238
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:52,169
things like credit cards are included
user accounts I would include locations

239
00:24:52,169 --> 00:25:00,950
billing locations all the generals that
stuff into some kind of network and

240
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,100
that'll start

241
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,080
letting a stroke and connections between
between users will will start to see as

242
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,678
credit card be shared between 500 users
are things like that can be a very very

243
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:20,220
strong signal again you can see maybe a
huge spike in a hundred or so accounts

244
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,490
getting created in the same location

245
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:34,970
you know things like that are also do is
we can start to record reputation so you

246
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,900
know a few times there about having
reputation Patel this is this is a

247
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:44,580
perfect place to solo Asian so most of
the graph databases are now know about

248
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,379
will let you store to plenty of
attributes against each node and so you

249
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,470
might have an account the number of
transactions they made in the past the

250
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:59,700
number of failures perhaps the value of
the transactions like customers made to

251
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,730
be useful information but then we're
going on to you know what's what's the

252
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,429
challenge also that every bottle is
information what was actually gonna be

253
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:17,809
good for starving in machine learning so
far as there are two basic rules we can

254
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:23,399
extrapolate once we got this graph we
want to avoid encountering too much of

255
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,350
our own business logic in this like it's
better if we can just meet in all of

256
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,360
those signals and have the system tell
us what its decision would be like

257
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,260
should we let us use our continued and I
had to we we have the perfect labeled

258
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:42,669
dataset that your business has 100
transactions you've seen the ones that

259
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:47,299
fails you seen the ones of you improves
so you have your own dates

260
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,279
what are the classifications one of the
labels for the results of our training

261
00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:00,950
so use that graph use those accounts and
train with the historic results levels

262
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:12,799
of things to do is make sure it's gotten
these models you want to be very careful

263
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,519
that anything that can affect your
production service for us so before

264
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,799
introducing one of these levels and
production you should make sure to

265
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,740
shadow those results are flying so she
records to very good

266
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:30,799
analytics about what decisions would
have been made but determine after the

267
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,889
fact whether those were effective work
you know how those were there being

268
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:48,260
negative impact to guide users like you
know this might sound like you should be

269
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,970
able to get any kind of action that
users taking maybe they're about to make

270
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,330
some kind of purchase

271
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:00,529
you should really be able to retrieve
any relevant information from your space

272
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:04,190
maybe a few models and soothe

273
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:08,399
couple hundred milliseconds like the
shuttle be there shouldn't be expensive

274
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,779
stuff that should be the kind of thing
you can do without the user necessarily

275
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:18,470
realizing has been taking place and that
compares very favorably I sent two

276
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:22,570
former heavyweight operations like
actually talking to the bank network

277
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:36,899
checks so few lessons learns from seeing
sort of stuff it does it definitely

278
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:41,649
requires bigs internal engineering
vestments like this stuff is crap

279
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:46,719
station specific you need to know what
signals are going to extract walks and

280
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,380
stuff you're going to store in your and
your reputation at work and that's not

281
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,730
really something that can be sold

282
00:28:53,730 --> 00:29:01,190
off the shelf products some lenders may
claim otherwise I would be skeptical of

283
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:09,970
those claims saying what's out there
certainly try to use the brown tree

284
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:15,300
signals where you can have previously
declined transactions and chargebacks

285
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,110
like those are those are things that
happen in the real world the United from

286
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:24,240
your own date so that they're the
perfect things to train ago I heard of

287
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,570
stories where people tried to use other
feedback from the system already used

288
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:34,460
previous decisions of baubles to relearn
against I tend to think that kind of

289
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,490
stuff is very risky like you risk
getting into things like read backwards

290
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:44,110
when you're training thing is considered
deteriorating the signals moulder data

291
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:53,219
so you know it is or has a user account
long time I can you maybe don't want to

292
00:29:53,220 --> 00:30:01,230
apply the same level of trust you want
how about how to six months and use

293
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:06,980
external signals as well are available
so there is one really useful feature

294
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:13,590
that most credit card tokenizer as i
striped Braintree they can provide a

295
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:21,149
sort of a fingerprint card details and
news in an identifying way to link

296
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:26,350
appearances on the same card across
multiple users so that that's a great

297
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:31,659
examples of the perfect thing to use of
edges between the nodes and a very very

298
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,630
powerful

299
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:47,950
and a few more tonight is just so there
are adjusting to the prostate spaces out

300
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:55,080
there near near for jay is very popular
on the something I haven't really looked

301
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:01,620
into yet old castle which is from GCHQ
seems to have a lot of these properties

302
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,179
the same kind of mechanism that might be
so there were stuck out if you're single

303
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:14,070
building something like this was a great
experience in terms of training and kind

304
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:18,659
of deploying models there are more
sophisticated things you can do there

305
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:24,020
I'm sure and I think the raven like a
few sort of cloud and hosted base

306
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,570
machine learning tools becoming
available those might also be worth

307
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:35,290
looking into depending on your level of
sensitivity personal information solely

308
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:40,030
to be aggressive about Robin Scholz like
you should you should consider these

309
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:45,120
checks to be negligible in terms of
latency cost you know you should also

310
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:53,389
run these things you should know of
course that you get back to learn and

311
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,630
use less the way to go

312
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,870
the cost to business for various actions

313
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,330
and also another maybe maybe not

314
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:08,059
to build a world where you have
different types of decisions to give a

315
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:17,139
whole sometimes it can be useful for
making transactions and authorization on

316
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,930
a credit card like just a check that
house the right amount of value

317
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:25,590
available or sometimes you might just
want to go ahead and start straight away

318
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:31,340
like that that's maybe a good example of
the kind of thing if you have a reason

319
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:39,809
to suspect this person like me maybe
once ahead of time and also had got a

320
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:45,940
few resources which are the slides will
be posted for a few of our schools which

321
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,580
all relates building was kind of
protection systems and see what's out

322
00:32:50,580 --> 00:33:09,620
there there are there are people too
kind of things better so I just want to

323
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:15,709
think about some of the Farallones when
security so this is all very much for a

324
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:22,350
discussion again I don't have much of a
security background myself I've heard a

325
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:28,678
few comment this is kind of similar to
what same systems are supposed to do so

326
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:31,960
like to load them

327
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,820
it's certainly possible for these
protection systems to involve human seat

328
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:43,159
back our toxic I sing used a little bit
so especially to avoid tolls like it if

329
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,710
you are in any doubt maybe we should we
should alert so long you human operators

330
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,480
intermediate there I think that's more
similar to say maybe where Utah

331
00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:01,230
arrays I think maybe one key differences
is that there is very application

332
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,070
specific vendors are trying to sell
things where you just plug it into a

333
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:15,529
network printer access logs magically
provides you and another sort of like

334
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:20,470
with any of these two approaches work
for other privileged access decisions if

335
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:24,969
you if you're trying to decide whether
to allow users to log into a certain

336
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:31,359
resource these kind of metrics
everybody's that's again something I'd

337
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,000
be interested in joining people out

338
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,090
and one thing which I have so much
experience was better at least have seen

339
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:47,889
in the past is some more sophisticated
attackers will sort of actually staged

340
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:52,870
their operations might just be a case of
sign up for an account make some

341
00:34:52,870 --> 00:35:01,529
transactions to actually be a counselor
created ahead of time sometimes were

342
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,390
able to talk to you again using ages but
sometimes they're prepared quite well

343
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:12,810
and quite carefully and then they may
sit idle for a long time I don't know

344
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:19,390
any great race heads massively tax or
kind of slipped out I guess you could

345
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:29,650
use things like we certainly try to
reactivate Council trusted but I'd also

346
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:34,540
be very keen to hear from anyone who has
ideas about protecting a network network

347
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,540
attacks

348
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,710
I think that's about all I had to think
we should house a little bit of time for

349
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:54,490
questions I do some work for a nonprofit
fundraising campaign at the end of

350
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:59,990
november december as many do and one of
the things we discovered is that the art

351
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:04,259
vendors are using us as an Oracle to
figure out of their cars were still

352
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:11,380
alive they were making very small
numbers of you know $1 $5 charges and of

353
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:17,130
course these will all be charged that
but we finally figured out that our

354
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,480
objective is to give them as little as
possible so they couldn't use us as an

355
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,170
Oracle but the funny thing we notice is
that there are some people who are Robin

356
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:32,119
Hood and they were giving us thousands
of dollars of debit card and we still

357
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,240
don't understand why they were doing
that because we could think of no way

358
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:41,189
that they can to their benefit so I
wonder if you happen to have seen that

359
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:47,690
in context people to a very large
transactions on debit cards just a value

360
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:55,000
for example this really interesting that
turmoil there is a very good ones ninety

361
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,640
say faces a good example of people
testing credit cards trying to figure

362
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,839
out how much that he was on there yes we
have seen that kenneth starr gets the

363
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,460
best practice advice there is a very
reserved now what you actually indicates

364
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,839
that the user of power lines and the
transaction might you do don't want to

365
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:25,880
use the car like maybe you might even
know stall and some of the responses

366
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,160
that credit card processors will tell
you why the card was declined but

367
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,410
generally it's good practice not to
expose that was returning the second

368
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,910
point about having seen Robin Robin Hood
ask you some credit cards

369
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:49,220
so I mean the main point of reference I
have a list and I would maybe leave it

370
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:54,470
to your imagination but there are
reasons why people would want to use

371
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:58,509
transport United raised me on stolen
credit cards such as Apple it pretty

372
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:07,079
clear value proposition why they would
donate using so is very interesting I

373
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:18,019
have any answers but maybe so many of
which have a question here so I have a

374
00:38:18,019 --> 00:38:21,019
friend who shall remain unnamed

375
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:29,509
the lack of a better word costs friendly
wrong so you know the used to provide

376
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:36,740
wrestle but I'm not a big fan of the
details and so did so he would actually

377
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:43,859
prefer himself email ids are free Google
Voice numbers are free and his critics

378
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:52,190
are provided so you pretty much gay
rights for like six months do you have

379
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:59,390
any lessons learned from that tape
contact me mention that but yeah I mean

380
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:03,618
we we and over and many other companies
make a lot of useful to Poland's

381
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:10,630
incentivize users we really like to
think of lies we like to think of them

382
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,920
in a sense in many ways the same as
credit cards like they're just a source

383
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,920
of funds it so happens we've issued them
to you our souls but we certainly don't

384
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:27,109
want an issue too many of them like we
really want to cry when granting credit

385
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:30,869
to you and hoping you're going to use
our service so I would actually say that

386
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,519
like chipmunks where one of the first
applications of a lot of the type of

387
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:40,250
technology reviews in here like just
texting someone you know from the same

388
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:45,970
device are going so so so that mean

389
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:53,509
new device so i hope i hope i mean
basically we are we are very concerned

390
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:59,160
about and this is also an occasional
type of software do to defend against

391
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:23,598
chinese have limitations on the number
of coupons will will issue we also have

392
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,060
geographic restrictions and other things
to make sure that uses in planning and

393
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:33,349
we have a lot of those monitoring and
alerting on National Stock at the end of

394
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:39,630
the day most of it comes down to
detecting the same person again I mean

395
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:46,340
there's not ultimately a huge amount of
the lab we do have you know there are

396
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,380
various checks we have to try and make
sure it's not being abused on a regular

397
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:58,140
basis I asked two questions first one to
answer the second ones may be a bit

398
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:03,190
longer I worked for a it's kind of an on
demand

399
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:09,730
marketplace company and two-sided market
place and we're facing a lot of she's

400
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:16,240
right now the question is is there an
industry standard for how much customers

401
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:23,000
are in line to get authorize my boss
told me that the charger and a dollar

402
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,869
also got a huge drop us but that would
solve a lot and a second question is you

403
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:36,560
mentioned using more complex graph based
solutions to tackle but what about using

404
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,330
something like a sex it's based on plate
D and you just kind of you know raised

405
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,160
an alert if you have I don't know

406
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:55,020
more excited about it about once a nerdy
asian once usual for using

407
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:05,920
regarding what are some industry
standards like a star so there's

408
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,329
actually there's a really nice thing you
can do for those reservations this is

409
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:19,789
basically just paying benefits it does
have a person's kind of the links thanks

410
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:24,579
for the card so it is going to verify
the card is valid exists but it's not

411
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:28,170
actually gonna check anything about
balancing its not hold any funds for

412
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:32,849
that to be extremely useful like I had
actually been working on stuff $1 is

413
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:38,289
also a kind of implicit standards PayPal
does this interesting thing where if you

414
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:42,900
authorize for $1 they don't send an
email to notify the person which is kind

415
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,420
of unusual i think is a sort of implicit
understanding that this is a temporary

416
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:55,430
authorization but also things you can do
to change the statement which has once

417
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,759
again into higher values I think it's
less they're like I don't really know of

418
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,359
any standards there and then to answer
your second question yes I would say

419
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:12,180
like databases are not necessarily I
think where things start to get a tricky

420
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:18,339
as once you've got machine learning
smile when someone expert engineering

421
00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:21,960
knowledge there is definitely a lot you
can do without having to invest in

422
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:29,069
things like you stress 27 thresholds
even just using traditional databases

423
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:35,569
like house an index column which is the
DeviceID for user and kind of looked too

424
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:39,339
many people using a bucket of ice those
are those are much lower cost wise and

425
00:43:39,339 --> 00:43:43,150
that's that's a good way to get started
on a new kind of role in so more mature

426
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,970
stuff

427
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:57,930
I don't think of how much one question I
have have you been able most of the

428
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:02,629
information seems to be more about the
transactions themselves have you been

429
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:08,060
able to and you're looking to let
clickstream monolithic haha someone

430
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:18,090
moving tribute registering and stuff
like that question just a lot of it

431
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:23,820
depends on the level of instrumentation
you're willing to do it's actually I

432
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,090
should apologize it too much of us seem
to be about the transactions like that

433
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:32,570
there are a lot of other users signals
think Twitter had a lot of success I see

434
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:36,099
with their own spam team just
determining how quickly people are

435
00:44:36,099 --> 00:44:39,590
typing into the various Laden feels so
yes

436
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:44,750
don't just look at the financial stuff
use any signal you think we're different

437
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:52,930
a real loser loser hey I was gonna say
in response to the person who is talking

438
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:58,940
about large donations we have the exact
same problem and my understanding is

439
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:03,770
that in some cases it actually is the
car Robin Hood motivation like we have

440
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:09,369
people donating stuff to us there like
you guys are cool his money in there is

441
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:18,390
a charge back and the and the press
foundation but so the other problem that

442
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:23,390
we have heard is that a lot of that is
actually people testing high value high

443
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,390
limit credit cards and get the high
limit

444
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:50,250
out of it so it's probably that question

445
00:45:51,670 --> 00:46:00,079
economics so I have a couple of links in
the slides to do is that one article in

446
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,800
an RSA publication about that

447
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,030
reshaping slight I think that'd be a
good place to start I actually haven't

448
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:19,160
done a huge memories are in stock but
I'm sure that would lead to thank you

449
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:27,940
again and again I'm happy sighs and get
myself a special announcement as well

450
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:36,400
hey so everybody is worried about that
burning smell it's cool it's I had like

451
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,869
six people behind is is it ok to have to
leave act now it's at ninth and Harrison

452
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:46,369
something's on fire which if you're not
from here is like seven blocks away so

453
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:51,700
we just happen to be downwind we're fine
and he messes all over it so don't worry

454
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,399
about it and please stop asking me if
you need to evac if you need to tell you

455
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,690
