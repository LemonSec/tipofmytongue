1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,569
I'm gonna introduce dr Turner bonds and
her bond that stuff for an American to

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:14,739
say isn't so you been a serial
entrepreneur ur after you have a couple

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:25,009
pass and you graduate from an american
education I did congratulations I did

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,289
too and you have some National Science
Foundation grants what do you talk about

5
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:33,730
today we're going to talk about
protecting cloud servers using user

6
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:40,599
behavior cloud servers and artificial
intelligence alright I'm interested

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,600
thank you yes

8
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:54,210
eat the mike hello everybody so this
talk is going to focus on something that

9
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,420
is has proved to be very useful for us
internally as a company and for some

10
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,049
people that we have worked with and so
we want to share our experiences with

11
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,260
what has work what has not worked and
how can you use our experiences in

12
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,670
anything that we've learned this target
going to focus on protecting cloud

13
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,150
server see anything like Amazon's
horrors Rackspace fibers whatever it is

14
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:27,330
and the reason why I want to present
information people is as a necessary as

15
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,369
a day box as somebody who's doing
security inside an organization it's

16
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:35,220
important to conserve your time there
are so many issues that happen every

17
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,310
single day schedule chasing after rabbit
holes you need to understand exactly

18
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,920
what's important what's not that
important the second thing is to

19
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,920
maintain our sanity because when things
are on fire

20
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,259
sea-level wants everything to be sold in
the next five minutes that's not going

21
00:01:53,259 --> 00:02:00,049
to happen we're going to talk about the
status quo when it comes to how do you

22
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,810
currently protect access to cloud
servers anything like AWS tracks because

23
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,119
they mention what are the biggest
challenges and threats and ultimately

24
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,880
we're going to segue into

25
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,269
how you can use user behavior in your
organization without any vendor lock-in

26
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:23,760
and have better security and control
over your interest so let's jump in very

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,000
quickly I'm going to gloss over a couple
of these flights because everybody here

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,410
understands what I'm talking about

29
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,400
clouds carvers in most organizations are
chopped up in various leaders AWS I like

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,030
infrastructure as a service then there's
more Heroku will crowd like services

31
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,920
where expand as you need to and don't
worry about the actual server underneath

32
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,070
so on and so forth

33
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,680
then there's a new entry in da car
there's microscope you accept these are

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,790
the things are willing to talk about

35
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,739
it's also important to understand when
you're solving a security problem using

36
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,400
user behavior who is actually using
these servers majority of the time in

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:08,410
most organizations inside the box or I T
or W purse or security but there's also

38
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,930
other people who are accessing these
different purposes they might not be as

39
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,000
intense are technically as you but they
are also using for their purposes

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,340
whether it might be marketing

41
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,040
sometimes you seem company's marketing
wants to have its own infrastructure for

42
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,579
some reason they want to have their own
things running on their site and now

43
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,330
what we see in the last couple of years
is also better rise up automatic

44
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,280
software so most people have heard a
fair or used even Jenkins or some kind

45
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,870
of automatic testing Google software and
search these pieces of software also

46
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,959
allows accessing your cloud service it's
not just a human

47
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,930
automated process is not just a couple
of exercise a day but thousands maybe

48
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,120
millions of access how do you make sure
it's actually

49
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,650
tonight and it's doing the right thing
sexual talk about that very quickly the

50
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,390
status quo right now in most companies
and there are exceptions to this but in

51
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:13,070
most companies people are using heytell
debase username password eighty Kerberos

52
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,339
username passwords that's cool you
access that's one way that if you have

53
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,820
international companies servicing site
the network to access

54
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,060
people think that that's a great way to
do things because there is no user

55
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,520
account on the server it gets created
when you log until Dec security maybe

56
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,609
but the point being that the traditional
methods are still being used for their

57
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,640
more popular we are looking into servers
and one of the primary motivators for

58
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,840
using SSH keys in most organizations is
the ease of use people undertake

59
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,250
password I just want to type I as I get
logged in if I have a script gets

60
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,370
plugged in does what it needs to do etc

61
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,880
some mechanisms like that on top of that
people use IP filters to say well this

62
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,080
particular group of infrastructure can
only be accessed from this bastion host

63
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,140
this particular group of infrastructure
etc for computer computer communication

64
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,669
and there's a poor sleepy ends and such
so these are kind of the very high level

65
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:21,310
course buckets in order to protect
access cloud servers on top of that

66
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,420
there is another layer of abstraction or
directory services where you store

67
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:32,080
information about who is in your company
who is allowed to access to one more

68
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,669
layer above that and some of the popular
services that we've all heard about and

69
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:42,800
use Microsoft Active Directory and LDAP
and now even work which is not quite in

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,480
20 but people are using SAS BI solution
21 directory services except these

71
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,720
dietary services

72
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,030
the previous speaker mention iam

73
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,200
identity and access management that is
also now becoming a big part of

74
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,469
organizations where products like this
that whatever they do single sign-on for

75
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,950
web apps and they're trying to do I am
for all kinds of things there is a lack

76
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:18,539
of iam for infrastructure there is no
obvious iam

77
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:27,420
Russia it's pretty fragmented so let's
look at the challenges and threats some

78
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,430
of these

79
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,940
weekend really directly but some of them
are actually not that obvious because as

80
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,770
companies grow especially in the bay
area where if you have a startup you

81
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,599
want to hire the right person for the
right job and it doesn't really matter

82
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,870
whether that person is in Slovenia or
whether they're next to it matters a

83
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,520
little bit of course it does matter but
you want to get the best person for the

84
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,900
job so you have distributed keeps in
traditional companies everybody would be

85
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,729
told you need to come into the office
were gonna work from here this is our

86
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:01,430
place except now you have geographically
distributed teams furthermore shadow I T

87
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:09,100
has become a problem in the latest some
compromises that we've seen on our in my

88
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:16,420
experience which is shadow ATI cards
have been a big enabler of compromises

89
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,390
that have happened and the reason why
she had no idea can sometimes get used

90
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,060
in this manner is because the security
level of each one of those organizations

91
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,460
might not be as stringent as you you
don't even know who's actually accessing

92
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,440
your server all you know is that you
gave an SSH username password to

93
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,280
somebody in some different country and
that's been used to access your service

94
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,929
you don't know if it's tomorrow night
you don't know what they're doing the

95
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,210
right thing and you have some checks and
balances but that's another one of the

96
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,880
challenges the next one is the high
velocity of changes we've changed the

97
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,570
way we double of course we want to have
on doctor instance we run the tests on

98
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,430
our own doctor instance everything is
done over there did not push it over

99
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,040
there

100
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,450
induced that there's a very high
velocity up what you actually doing it

101
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,440
also comes using cloud resources at a
much more higher velocity where a

102
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,680
Tupperware so tax base every one of
these providers has provided you with an

103
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,030
EPA and all you do is you should an API
you get a new car to go loaded up from

104
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,559
an existing image you don't have to
spend kind and doing all the country the

105
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,710
nation's top furthermore another thing
that we have done we've seen is for

106
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,830
employee churn that also contributes to
the problem because as people leave the

107
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:33,500
organization it's not always easy to
take away their SSH keys I bet you that

108
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,030
if you talk two hundred companies more
than 90% of them will tell you that a

109
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,760
previous employees mississippi's are
still on the server

110
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,650
it's just a fact of life people want to
do is essentially rotations how many

111
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:59,110
actually attack surface is changing
horizontal movement the traditional

112
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,060
types of people are going up to
privileged accounts they no longer want

113
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,310
to get the sales guys account because
that's too hard to get vertical to his

114
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,239
exploration of the administrator and see
what we can do from there so that takes

115
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,910
hold a changing and gonna skip over this
lab we all understand what went on to

116
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:24,410
scaling escalation is let's talk about
going forward how do we protect

117
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,829
ourselves and our infrastructure bear
the first thing they want to talk about

118
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,870
is the concept of you right now if you
get a cloud server and you get another

119
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,140
comp so lets a good Rackspace I i have
access to their Xmas console I start a

120
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,090
cloud server over there and I can click
matter I can basically do anything that

121
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:50,370
i won on that server key for specific
situations but do you want to make that

122
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,930
be the default policy that you should be
able to do everything on a cloud over

123
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,870
I'm not sure you have to earn the right
to run certain commands certain scripts

124
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,970
or do things versus being given the
right from the get go to run things

125
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,750
that's something to think about

126
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:11,840
second thing is that any action that
people take a risk score it cannot be

127
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,080
without consequences if you run off
starter production cluster he should be

128
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,080
fired so everything should have some
kind of consequences with it you need to

129
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:27,280
understand how how what is the risk for
lack of a better term english is not my

130
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,280
native language but

131
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:37,939
so in order to do that what you need to
do is build a pipeline and we'll show

132
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:40,939
you how we have done it and how you can
do it very easily

133
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:45,689
you have to have a pipeline that
actually analyzes all the commands that

134
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:50,790
are being shipped to your actual doubts
arose from your travels on your lap and

135
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,329
ultimately the morning that we are going
to build is based on these for

136
00:10:55,329 --> 00:11:01,049
fundamentals of learning matching acting
and updating and we'll talk about how do

137
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:04,779
you learn how do you match what do you
match how to act and what do you update

138
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:10,739
so all this will be coming so let's jump
right into it that when we talk about

139
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:17,600
Cloud Servers what is it that you should
be looking out for if you want to do

140
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,489
some kind of profile you're trying to
build a model to say John uses X in this

141
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:28,609
way what does that statement actually
meet John uses her ex this week we have

142
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:33,569
to profile image on US one of the things
that you can do is analyzed the commands

143
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:39,919
what does John what level of access john
happy seeing that mister room where does

144
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:46,540
not accept so what commands for example
do you you've never tried anything to

145
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,049
EDC shadow ever why are you typing
something related to a tee shot on now

146
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:55,529
those are things that you need an lace
and you can flag them as a nominee since

147
00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:00,259
next thing is that we also look at
connection statistics to say Journal

148
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,439
patient base are you coming from a VPN
endpoint on not how many connections

149
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:08,868
have you opened up the parallels server
clusters etc and these are all signals

150
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:13,809
and features that you can use in order
to say whether a particular person or

151
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:18,899
access to US her is valid or not he had
been used in the right way or another

152
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:24,299
thing that you can do is when it comes
to taking action obviously any machine

153
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:29,410
learning I prefer to go out there

154
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,230
any machine learning-based system you
will have false positive there is no

155
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,280
system there's hundred-person anybody
tells you you're my false-positive rate

156
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:47,640
is zero don't talk to them it's it's not
possible examples so what you can do is

157
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,560
when you have false positives you
actually have a graceful way of doing

158
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,589
real-time adaptive two-factor
authentication and we'll show you how we

159
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:01,970
have done it on our site that's another
benefit of that and ultimately will

160
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,500
loose like up I just parked like it's
aight whatever we have used to build

161
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,780
things ourselves so you can go home and
you can get started and we will give you

162
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,740
tips about what exactly to look for a
new school so don't waste time figuring

163
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:21,000
out a bunch of things that have happened
already one of the ways to make a case

164
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,280
management to make time and space for an
effort late this is compliance they all

165
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:35,790
love the word contract compliance they
might not understand what actually is

166
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,530
going under the hood but the love this
point so they are legal consequences are

167
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,939
falling out of compliance with its PCI
Sox are different types of compliance

168
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,010
requirements etc what we are proposing
over here also helps you with compliance

169
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:53,569
because they're different types of
complex requirements let's say some one

170
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,840
complex requirements says admin account
fails to Logan three times on a server

171
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,340
you need to generate any other things
like what we are talking about shell to

172
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:09,050
actually do something like that you been
it's a tunable system that are so now

173
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,510
let's talk about who was using I did as
well as what I dyed it was so good all

174
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:21,200
that stuff let's talk about behavior
what do we mean by behavior so behavior

175
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,960
is basically a marker after identity
that's the way we think about it so when

176
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,150
we talk about we are talking about what
are the types of commands are using the

177
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,280
first easy thing that you can do is most
Linux systems will have some kind of

178
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,199
history fine and you can grab the
history fire and you can see what

179
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,470
commands have been done etc and you can
form a Bayesian more

180
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:49,160
very easy very easy to say out of 200
unique demands that I see these are the

181
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,219
top 20 these are the middle 20 xxx xxx
so this is a very simple low hanging

182
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,760
fruit that you can apply to any
commander doesn't fall within the top 50

183
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,450
person bucket market as I don't know I
need to verify do you really want to

184
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:08,270
underscore and you can have a 2000 API
business Intl mister the guy we're worse

185
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,840
for natives was trying to run it and
people except you can build your own

186
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,920
system nice little system like this but
that's one of the things that you can

187
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,280
look at what are the types of commands
and directly going to the history and

188
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,750
grabbing stuff from there is an easy way
to get started and will stop the system

189
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,070
furthermore tonight just the commands
you run what is the style in which you

190
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,880
actually run the commands what do we
mean by style so a lot of people

191
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,040
oftentimes they will change commands
using semicolons are David they have a

192
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,610
specific propensity to use a couple of
commands of pipes and so on and so forth

193
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,530
every person is a little bit different
so we are trying to understanding and

194
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,930
treatment analysis how many times does
the semicolon come up on usual in income

195
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:59,870
and accurate typing typing things what
are you doing things like that so to

196
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,210
give you an example of what we talked
about him he's a very quick screenshot

197
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:10,300
and apologize I don't feel like doing
right now but it'll be available on our

198
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:18,740
website by the end of this week so this
is basically a very quick example of a

199
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,920
screech and then just shows that I'm
just typing a couple of commands over

200
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,839
here what am i typing I'm just using
well-known piece of software called

201
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,480
cluster ssh to log into two servers
specifying where the celebration of the

202
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:38,630
port so when I type this particular
comment I tend to champion and I just

203
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:45,340
wanted to be there is no good reason I
just want on-line I like one-liners I

204
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,400
tried and it's one liners

205
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:54,110
so that's kind of something that you can
focus on and say that well dispersing

206
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,520
when they typed commands in Wonderland
why are they using something yes those

207
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,939
are also markers of your particular
behavior

208
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,100
furthermore a lot of people we've done
this research where you can easily tell

209
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:10,599
whether it's the right person or not by
looking at the mistakes that they make

210
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,659
when the typed commands because it's
it's it's the way you type

211
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:20,770
actually is pretty unique you will make
the same mistakes moreover when you type

212
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:26,889
come out if you typed list as I N light
yes for some reason you will make that

213
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,520
mistake you'll use the back special come
back and corrected whatever you will do

214
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,530
your thing over there

215
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:37,660
furthermore what we have also found this
time of day is not a very good indicator

216
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,680
that good or not but it is a good
indicator of a very coarse-grained

217
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,400
marker so for example you cannot use
time of day to say is that I Rabanne

218
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,100
logging into a server or not but do what
you can use that time of day to say is

219
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,879
that is that an attack going on on the
server because usually during this time

220
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,560
to this time there's between twenty to
fifty connection on that server a nice

221
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:08,720
250 so there's a difference between how
you use each feature Edward granularity

222
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,260
do you want to bring it to the person do
you want to bring it to a much more

223
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:19,400
realistic than other thing that uses
type of resource risk score was

224
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,060
something you have to understand how
important is that his doctor container

225
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,710
that I'm going to do not need after 30
minutes or is it

226
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,240
production server which one is it so
that he score also has to be predicated

227
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,780
on not just your user behavior the
commands the style and such but also

228
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,250
what type of resource that you are using

229
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:49,090
as we talked about if you look at the
type of commands that people type you

230
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,409
can have a very interesting buckets of
the type of comments some of the

231
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,370
comments and related to network
somebody's taking are coming in is

232
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:03,939
working fine so you can even create
profiles to say how does what are the

233
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,280
various types of commander of the
buckets of commands that a person runs

234
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:14,770
page of comments thereon for network
stuff and system stats is much higher

235
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,310
than anything else for committing to get
her they're uploading downloading

236
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:23,429
whatever they're doing it slightly
different from that that's on a marker

237
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:28,330
to say I do you in the right group or
not I know I know he's coming from an IB

238
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:33,949
I know they use let's ride also analyzed
the group of commands that Iran is he

239
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,800
falling in the network bucket is he
working in the US that's what is he

240
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:45,389
doing and as I mentioned we try to do
our server 45 per person and that's

241
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,120
important because the way you access
again your doctor container is not the

242
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,120
way that you access your production
sorry there's a difference will also

243
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,909
have a different profiles orders when we
talk about creating feature sets there

244
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:09,180
is some of the things that we talk about
is basically to say that when you look

245
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,300
at these commands what what is important
you can try to do frequency analysis

246
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,460
that's one easy way to get started with
these future sets and you have to feed

247
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,550
this feature sets to a classifier
something like a lady trees are any

248
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:28,540
stamps and in one easy way to get
started with this is a tool called wake

249
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,970
up or I get by with ties W E

250
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:37,360
k-8 and side-by-side little R&R cited by
whichever one of these are really easy

251
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,909
as a graphical user interface all you do
is just read a file it's basically a

252
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:48,340
fire with a couple of CSV entries and it
loaded up you can do jewish hentai such

253
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,899
tests on it

254
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:56,520
by is a little more powerful it's in
Python it's more in 2014 to me but you

255
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,180
can try any one of these and you'll find
that it's easy for you to identify a few

256
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:08,470
features that make meaningful sense to
your classification problem ultimately

257
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,200
what you want to do with all this
feature classification is to obtain a

258
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,550
score to say because you don't know for
sure if this person is actually an urban

259
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,480
are not based on their behavior what we
are getting is a school conference call

260
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,330
to say

261
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,600
1950 19 what it what is it

262
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,590
how much confidence do I have been
saying he's just a guy or not you have

263
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,100
to then set thresholds to say you know
what if it's below zero point seven five

264
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,909
just don't let the person accessing a
blessed I don't know it's too much of

265
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:44,260
her and this is this is one of the
problems with this approach where there

266
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:49,120
is no one size fits all there is no
magic bullet that is good for you is

267
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,379
good for me

268
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:57,210
among false positives that I can
tolerate in my company is different from

269
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,070
the amount of false positives that you
can tolerate in your company so there

270
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,750
has to be a way to change those markers
and say

271
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,760
opened 75019

272
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:17,520
identical except when you when we talk
about classification there are basically

273
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,010
two basic groups money supervised
learning and one is unsupervised

274
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,620
learning for supervised learning their
various classification techniques leg

275
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:32,570
base as if if you get your hands on
record by I would recommend that go

276
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:38,350
there is a simple method it's easy to
understand and it helps you that if you

277
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,209
have one dimensional data plan to that
data to separate the data points into

278
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:47,750
good and bad good and bad so instead I
mean I wouldn't try out different models

279
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,160
different algorithms everything but if
you're looking for quick bang for your

280
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,090
buck go for beta is being it'll give you
good results very quickly and there are

281
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,250
specific reasons as to why

282
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,470
for unsupervised you can use something
like a means our expectation

283
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:08,950
maximization except my favorite is as
being nice for us one thing to keep in

284
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:14,710
mind days as we look at all these
features and we say oh maybe style makes

285
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,960
sense maybe the number of semicolons
makes its me this makes us what you're

286
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,420
actually doing is creating all this
feature sets to say is this important is

287
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,510
this important is this important
exception if you use a lick it has a

288
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:32,270
very nice practical easy way to also
show you something called PCA which is

289
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:37,620
principal component analysis and it's a
fancy word but all in all it basically

290
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,489
does is it shows you out of all these
features which ones really important

291
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:46,270
which one should you be focusing on to
do before you should be focusing on

292
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,350
these five birdies 10 instead of these
fifty that you think are important

293
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,959
because ultimately what you want is to
have a very targeted set of features

294
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,080
that you're looking at to get good
prediction accuracy on their team that

295
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,820
to keep in mind when you do this is more
data is not always good

296
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,620
primarily because there's bias in the
data from standardized dirty there's

297
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,360
different types of issues with it so
just i mean what you should try to do is

298
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,959
get a chunk of data develop your system
on top of that data if you see her going

299
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,070
in the right direction then you can add
more data to the classification issue

300
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:33,810
its house but don't just add more that I
better not to be better doesn't war that

301
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:40,060
nice I did but it doesn't there's bias
there's noises different types of shows

302
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:48,860
one of the common things that we
sometimes get sucked into ways to say is

303
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,080
this a foreign power its lights it's an
iPhone and it's like this glass in the

304
00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:00,040
front is going batty obviously so the
normal way of thinking is if I add more

305
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,600
features to this classification
obviously going to be better that's not

306
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,480
always the case primarily because if you
think of a three-dimensional space and

307
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,360
their space

308
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,479
the water features you're adding the
envelope that can separate whether this

309
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,920
point is inside a bubble are
disappointed outside the bubble as you

310
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,870
add more features this bubble is no
longer sphere it turns into an ice

311
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:30,620
crystal where each data point is at the
end of a nice crystal the problem that

312
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,760
happens between something like that is
in the real world when you will talk

313
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,129
voice data plans for classification of
this ice crystal

314
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:46,140
outside a not gonna give you any kind of
useful measure so always having brunch

315
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:52,799
features doesn't mean that you have
better prediction so how do you actually

316
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,129
make the data actionable let's say you
found a way to qualify and quantify that

317
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,059
this is under bonnie's access far exceed
everything seems good everything nice

318
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,220
everything doesn't seem good what then
how do you make it actually one of the

319
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:12,090
easiest race is that you can build a
session you can change out the SSH keys

320
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:16,040
immediately not let that person have
access again if you don't want to go to

321
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,120
that extent what you can do is build
your own custom implementation where you

322
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,959
can just send an SMS somebody or use an
existing API offers and just ask the

323
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,830
person hey used a fingerprint sensor on
the phone and tell me you're trying to

324
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:34,260
run if they do show the comment

325
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,540
and this is a graceful way of handling
false positives because otherwise you

326
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:42,220
would need to have a ninety
administrator at a dedicated security

327
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:48,010
security person looking at all the
commands that gets up and making just as

328
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:53,429
shown on well does he really want to run
the sting white guess when you can have

329
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:57,830
the person say yes I really want to run
this there's a slight difference but it

330
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:06,939
works very nicely and other thing is
that you can if you if you really nice

331
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:12,490
lehrer authentication and authorization
going on to say for example if I'm

332
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:15,940
trying to access the server and I'm
trying to do something funny to that

333
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,890
server

334
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,230
you can send your to factor in earlier
to say oh you trying to understand your

335
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:26,360
comment on the sorrow and the same time
you can send a notification to the owner

336
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,209
of the business owner of that specific
server cluster the nine months trying to

337
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:36,940
not let him run it or not you can have
two men protocol see man whatever you

338
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,920
like it's all based on this entire
mechanism you can also do dynamic

339
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,150
modification ultimate goal being if you
are trying to do something bad we should

340
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:51,580
restrict your privileges in real time if
you're fine do whatever you need to do

341
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:57,990
and this hostile forces the attackers to
learn how you use cloud servers if I

342
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,910
steal and going on I can do my tanks in
most cases but it forces me as an

343
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:09,760
attacker also learn what are you
actually doing one of the things that we

344
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,270
all need to understand days systems need
to keep learning so there has to be a

345
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:17,639
constant stream of data you cannot just
grabbed it up from history files from

346
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,980
the same log and change your system on
it and then let it knows and then you

347
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,390
cannot expect that people will not
complain about it

348
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:29,810
primarily because the way people using
the system you need to refresh it with

349
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:35,370
the way people are using different types
of passover weekend approaches but we

350
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,709
shouldn't obsess about it primarily
because readers to purchase some

351
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,380
somethings are very common sense they'll
work nicely but when you start to scale

352
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,380
how many rules would you rate it's not
possible

353
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:51,300
you cannot but it's late asking somebody
look into a crystal violence they will

354
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,010
wonder what's going to happen tomorrow I
don't know she can really keep writing

355
00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:00,290
rules this also helps build orbiting
shadow idea counts as we mentioned so

356
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:09,899
that's another benefit very quickly so
let's go to the actual tools that we can

357
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,100
use to build up this pipeline some of
the freely available and actually very

358
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,110
easy to use tools that you can get
started in the next 15 minutes that's

359
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:23,399
enough to get started is actually cited
by four wickets these are very easy to

360
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,260
use tools you can download them all and
there are even tutorials to give you

361
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,160
data sets to tell you that all

362
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,160
he would you like to try our expectation
maximization

363
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:39,630
so that's very very helpful the second
thing use a lot of people have probably

364
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:45,470
use it or heard of it is a project which
is basically a week to gather a lot of

365
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,960
data from endpoints on pumping a
reliable way to your system we have used

366
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,890
what we found is it's a good way to
shift based on information from a lot of

367
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:03,350
in points to our analysis as to hop on
top of that aspire there again people

368
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,709
might have heard of it used it
approaches Park is a good way of doing

369
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,980
distributed number

370
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,660
weather for statistical purposes but it
takes whatever you need say you are

371
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,230
trying to find say running means of
something because that's what our

372
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,470
algorithm is based on you can do that
very fast very reliably with very little

373
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,450
effort

374
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,030
these are again very useful I mentioned
when you're just an example you have to

375
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:29,370
use 2004 sending SMS anything you can
use whatever you like it's just an

376
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:34,260
example we have used nor Jess internally
for a couple of our services you don't

377
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,940
have to use it but this is basically the
stacked up behind the first he was the

378
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:45,370
one that help you develop the plumbing
for this entire system again as I

379
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:49,879
mention when you start off with wake up
when you start of its like it but look

380
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,250
at a lady trees a beast on things like
this they will save you time you don't

381
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,540
have to go an experiment that every
single thing under the Sun and then find

382
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:03,379
out about this doesn't really work well
for this dataset so what does the

383
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:09,000
plumbing ultimately look like one thing
that we have not mention till now he is

384
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,390
in order for you to actually make this
actionable you need to have some kind of

385
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:24,050
SSH proxy otherwise there is no real way
for you to take action on it so let's

386
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:30,820
say whatever to come and I have to have
a way to stop that command from hitting

387
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:35,320
the server issue if I don't use any
trucks it's very hard for me to do that

388
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,860
I have to go to the server installed I
can do it on the server side if I wanted

389
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,250
to

390
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,650
but the downside of that is I am what I
find myself rematches which I don't want

391
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:51,490
to do that's just our use and the way we
use it as if you assign a server to us

392
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:56,820
and say that nobody protects critical
server designs you can use dynamic DNS

393
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,360
to basically tell the user that hey
yesterday you type is a said John act

394
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,719
server 1.com today you'll type said John
underscores at your company dot com

395
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:12,330
whatever that might be so that's one
easy way to also put it into scripts and

396
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,679
let them just go crazy to the proxy
under their name so because everything

397
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:23,820
is not going to the proxy of course the
question being yes so you need to have

398
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,850
multiple proxies the great thing about
that is you can always argue for more

399
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:35,659
prime or budget for doing that by saying
look separation of duties on separation

400
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,850
of traffic so democratic go through this
proxy proxy production tropical saudis

401
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:46,649
proxy customer-driven goes to this proxy
etc you can neatly laid out what we can

402
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:54,550
do is the way that can happen when you
attach a particular server to this

403
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:59,570
system it goes in and automatically
changes out all the SSH keys for the

404
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:05,189
users that are on that server once it
changes all this is a Jew keys it

405
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:10,530
ultimately what will happen is you will
take the nuances of the proxy using an

406
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,139
existing key on your laptop

407
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,340
there's a completely new keypad that
opens up a tunnel on the other side

408
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:20,419
joins us because we are joining you can
do it introspection to say come on

409
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,120
introspection to say what are you typing
we were not going to let this coming

410
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,239
July eccentrics a track that's one
approach that you can take and of course

411
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,890
as I mentioned you can use SMS Email
whatever you want to tell anybody that

412
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,390
things are happening but the interesting
thing is that you don't have to just

413
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,830
stop here once you have your system

414
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:47,850
why stop at Cloud Servers you can also
provide kodak's the way you behave is

415
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:52,870
different from the way you behave on
facebook how many pics do you do on

416
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:57,610
Facebook in 10 seconds how many kids do
you doin babe out in 10 seconds how much

417
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:01,219
do you scroll what is the curvature of
the most when you moved things on

418
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,410
Facebook and a paper these are all
markers that you can again pull up and

419
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:11,179
the week we implemented a very simple
solution lawyer for browser extensions

420
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:17,010
from a really powerful you can gather a
lot of information from these two say

421
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:23,860
like what's actually going on except
type there has been a lot of talk about

422
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:31,110
using typing patterns in the past just
wanted to clarify that we've done our

423
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:37,409
experience has been typing speed is a
very poor indicator and instruct

424
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:44,040
withdraws positives for some reason
we've never been never been able to use

425
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:50,520
typing speed as a good indicator of you
are not primarily because people make

426
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:59,810
mistakes and typing speed is a little
bit behind but just because typing speed

427
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,290
is not a base not a good indicator
doesn't mean typing patterns are a good

428
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:09,430
indicator is something like you going on
a site you wanna side you see a

429
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:14,600
registration page it says first name
last name that I don't you have a way of

430
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,500
going to all these fields by using the
cab or by using the most people do it in

431
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,040
different manners so that's one
indicator which is actually pretty good

432
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,840
to say that when you visit a web app you
actually use tap to navigate to all the

433
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,150
farming trees

434
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:34,539
the good thing about going to this
approach is that you will not have any

435
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:39,640
vendor lock-in there is no software that
you would have to buy you can be our own

436
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,819
thing you can customize it as you or
whatever you like you will have the

437
00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:51,079
option of deciding how you want to do so
mitigation you can not be held back by a

438
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:54,369
vendor saying this is the way we do it
and that's how it's going to happen

439
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:58,839
your data is in your control and
ultimately will have adaptive two-factor

440
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:04,230
authentication with 203 man whatever you
like the point being if your

441
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:09,579
infrastructure is your infrastructure in
your company is divided up in various

442
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:12,869
markets it's really important it's
important

443
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:19,180
who cares that's kind of the spectrum in
most companies if it's really important

444
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,618
you have the choice of saying how much
productive two-factor authentication

445
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:25,950
should they put in front of their
because you're doing it in a real-time

446
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:31,490
way and the good news is this actually
low friction between be abused this with

447
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,819
other people they found that pushed back
from internal employees isn't much

448
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:39,808
longer if you do it like this versus
other challenges that we faced in the

449
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:46,049
past again as I mentioned we all need
budget and time for doing something like

450
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:50,609
this here are some pointers as to how to
make the case to sea level to say look I

451
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:54,160
really want to do this project going to
help us do what we're gonna get out of

452
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,609
this product so again toward compliance
you can say he's gonna protect customer

453
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:02,420
data it's going to be harder for
somebody they were breaking to actually

454
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:07,079
get access data better control and
ultimately time savings but I T will be

455
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:10,859
more efficient exception to there are
some points to be made in order to say

456
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:16,589
that it is a good investment of money
and document by his don't end up on

457
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:21,230
TechCrunch forwards or whatever I'm not
picking on snapchat but I'm just saying

458
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:30,279
that things happen and nobody likes but
this was a very quick presentation and

459
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:34,670
we didn't discuss the mathematical
aspects of a lot of things but the good

460
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,890
news is that if you tried those pieces
of software if you look at those any

461
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,839
trees and limbs that I mention

462
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:45,910
it's actually very easy to get started
and the good news is that we all when we

463
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:49,649
were particularly in technology
companies we have access to the data

464
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:54,410
just think about the history data that
you have on your server attacks it next

465
00:37:54,410 --> 00:38:00,848
step is going to assume from Splunk or
anything of that sort so the possibility

466
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:07,009
that actually Inglis what you can do and
the good news is you control the

467
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:11,829
security envelope not a vendor you
control what is right for your

468
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:17,680
organization not somebody so I'll stop
here but if there are any questions I'll

469
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:28,348
be happy to answer we built our own
discussed yesterday so the question is

470
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:35,420
what do you use as an SSH proxy we used
our own solution but we are going to

471
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:44,380
make it available for everybody from our
get up each so you don't have to but any

472
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:50,219
SSH proxy open-source proxy that's out
there and for a couple of ones that we

473
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:51,289
have looked at one is called

474
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:56,579
Piper it's actually very easy it's like
four runs are scored that you need to

475
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:00,119
putting to basically do come and
introspection and things like that

476
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:31,490
there is a good question we don't have a
good handle on that question was that

477
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,720
age having directed VIP session and
you're trying to run commands from how

478
00:39:36,720 --> 00:40:28,560
do you stop that we don't have to if you
are looking at you should look at it

479
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,700
because that is a good piece of
information that's a good marker

480
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,270
definitely something to keep in my hand
does our main solution look at minus are

481
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:39,270
tunnels

482
00:40:39,900 --> 00:42:08,720
script in a certain time certain types
of scripts that we've analyzed with

483
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,779
people that will work bit they they are
running when when we look at our proxy

484
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:20,150
we see certain commands that are coming
in using it changed fashion so I am

485
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:24,470
being changed something cat eccentrics I
tried cetera that's one indicator for us

486
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:28,899
to say when somebody's running a
particular script that we know about its

487
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:34,539
usually 1950 piping commands except but
if that suddenly changes that's an

488
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:39,020
indicator for us to say that well it's
falling outside the classification on

489
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,970
with up we'll have to do something to
make sure has sent a notice to the

490
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:47,859
actual I T owner and say that the script
is trying to run this command should be

491
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:49,160
let it go to or not

492
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:58,578
it's not it's not as we take charge

493
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:04,819
intervals and try to update it because
there's it is realistic that people will

494
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:15,200
change a little bit to the actions have
to get that information thank you
