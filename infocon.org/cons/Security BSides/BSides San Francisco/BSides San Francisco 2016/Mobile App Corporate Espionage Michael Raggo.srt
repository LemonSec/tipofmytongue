1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,690
participation this is recycled materials
his story by working I B Sides this year

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:22,390
and never question your mobile app
caressed yeah i read your book not quite

3
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:42,300
an interesting question is Android or
Windows and Android realism that sounds

4
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,949
great and they should go with Apple
because it's right ahead almost three

5
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,350
times the vulnerabilities and redhead in
2015

6
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:03,890
hey guys my name is Mike Crager works
for a mobile security company and today

7
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,310
what I thought it would cover is mobile
app corporate espionage sort of a mashup

8
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,799
of a lot of research have been doing
over the years stemming from a lot of

9
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,630
the data hiding covert communications
and steganography research have been

10
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,149
doing over the last fifteen years in
conjunction with a really really good

11
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,990
friend of mine check Hosmer who also
shares a lot of the same research and

12
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,059
used to run a company by the name of
whetstone technologies that did a lot of

13
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,000
forensic research it also incorporates a
lot of additional research around mobile

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,500
mobile security so I just got back from
hat on in Norway and presented a variety

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,090
of SmartWatch security research and my
SmartWatch attack tool known as heart

16
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,680
attack so highlight that the
presentation as well because they're

17
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,299
also applications to mobile apps as they
relate to smart watches and then if time

18
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:01,640
permits I'll get into some mobile device
wifi covert communications as well

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,440
around some research that during prime
time this fall

20
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:11,770
so rather than getting to where I am my
background just know that if you like

21
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:17,140
what you see today a lot of it is cited
in the research that chechen I authored

22
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,950
in our data hiding book and then more
recently mobile data loss threats and

23
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,299
countermeasures so out of this is
citations from now that book and then

24
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,270
also little bit more deep dive into the
actual research so so we take a look at

25
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:38,350
the mobile corporate espionage threat
vector landscape certainly there's a lot

26
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,210
of risky behaviors in our that we've
seen in particular recently around

27
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:49,700
mobile out in the next few slides or
talk a little bit more about mobile

28
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,929
wraps or mobile remote access Trojans
and talk about some of the behaviors

29
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,660
that we see an ongoing basis and then
roll on talk more broadly a lot about

30
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,340
the the data hiding out that are that
are out there in addition you a lot of

31
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,680
these behaviors and also stem from a
device that's become compromised

32
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,560
jailbroken rooted prefers escalation
custom ROMs and so forth and so as a

33
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,340
result there definitely unlocked
behaviors that happen as a result of a

34
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:27,180
compromise device furthermore when I get
deeper into summer mobile app behaviour

35
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,980
there's also concepts relating to decoy
files things that allow you to remain

36
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,380
covert despite the best detections that
are out there so although somebody may

37
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,650
be looking for a malicious mobile app
for mobile app that allows you to

38
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,840
communicate correctly how you hide that
data may not be securely in other words

39
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,680
may not be hidden in a particular file
but a series of files that also read a

40
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,750
bunch of decoy calls thus making it
infinitely more difficult to detect and

41
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:03,310
then as i mentioned all talk if time
permits all talk a little bit more about

42
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,790
Sandra wi-fi security research

43
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,019
that I've been doing over the years as
it relates to pecan stuffing virtual

44
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:20,380
wifi I think it's important though to
first take an initial look at the threat

45
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,350
landscape and really you know why do
people hide data while though we can

46
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,210
certainly come increasingly concerned
around corporate espionage whether that

47
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,680
be

48
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,930
cyber espionage or more related to our
corporate network or an insider threat

49
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,440
certainly also people especially in this
day and age 12 maintain their privacy as

50
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,370
well

51
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,740
in addition to that made fine Coker
communications as it relates to malware

52
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,400
that may impact financial institutions
in those particular mobile apps so

53
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,239
although you may be looking for these
risks you may be identifying a variety

54
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,599
of mobile apps across your enterprise
maybe the intent behind it isn't what

55
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:03,370
you initially thought so sometimes we
find organizations will have an initial

56
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:09,039
knee jerk reaction which is good so he's
good but there's also the intent and

57
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:16,760
it's not always malicious just kind of
an interesting history nugget that kinda

58
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,940
bridges this to mobile you may have seen
a few years back where McAfee released

59
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,719
some security research at black hat and
DEFCON related to operation shady rat

60
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,810
and this was something that they had
tracked her fly maybe arguably seven

61
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:39,370
years in terms of a remote access Trojan
which allowed remote command control and

62
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,050
exfiltration of data from a variety of
government agencies and impacted a lot

63
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,849
of countries around the world was
probably one of the most impactful

64
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:57,210
research around this particular topic in
addition it does have correlations to

65
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,770
mobile rats or remote access Trojans in
particular we can take a look at the

66
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:09,320
flow here whether it's distributed
through an email phishing email with

67
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,639
malicious link

68
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,479
lagoon had done research on now owned by
checkpoints had done research around

69
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,960
identifying malicious links that were
sent through what's happened the

70
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,349
whatsapp app but however you distribute
this and convince the user to click on

71
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:30,180
the link you can now wear slippers the
ability to deploy the wannabes Trojans

72
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,999
on to advise ok nothing special there
right but where it gets into the

73
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:41,029
interesting aspect is that now with that
capability wetherbee work WordPress or

74
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:46,229
something else you can host a picture
file or other types of content that this

75
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:50,800
app can actually download and update
itself dynamically so if you're looking

76
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,389
for a destination IP is that might be
malicious if you're looking for

77
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:59,389
malicious sites this now hides months
you know somewhat innocuous sites like

78
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,870
WordPress and then of course as it goes
through those updates and cannot update

79
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,919
dynamically them around their remote
command and control next alteration of

80
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:17,039
do that so what the heck are we looking
for sure that you know if I have

81
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,539
concerns around an individual or
organization that may be performing some

82
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:25,818
form of corporate espionage maybe
there's some type of suspicious

83
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,969
behaviors were kind of apps

84
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:35,469
behaviors are actually working well just
like any other category there's a whole

85
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:41,199
variety of corporate communications data
hiding steganography type apps littered

86
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,259
across the Apple App Store Google Play
and even Windows stores well said Droid

87
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,539
is kind of interesting picked a few here
that we've done research around that

88
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,669
were a little bit different than your
average like I took a picture and I get

89
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:57,810
a message or another picture in it and I
emailed it

90
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:04,380
this one takes advantage of audio files
or OGG format with also sometimes come

91
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,889
early

92
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:10,630
correlated to ringtones and allows you
the ability to hide a message in san

93
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,139
kana audio recording

94
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,800
furthermore provides the ability and
once you get in your content and you

95
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,760
wanna send it it'll also purchased from
the app once you perform that behavior

96
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,180
that's kind of covering up any kind of
Forensic Identification now then this

97
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,080
strange you know known to be
steganography type of that in addition

98
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,870
you can also leverage encryption with it
as well

99
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,960
the state Droid is for Android Open pup
is also quite interesting

100
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,430
open as one of the first steps that we
identified a while back that actually

101
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:54,300
provides the ability to disperse you are
hidden data across multiple files in

102
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,029
additionally get your own decreased
files so sending out a flurry of files

103
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:04,200
maybe 20 files only a couple contain the
data which by the way is spread amongst

104
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,180
multiple files along with the whole
littering equate files to see think

105
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,339
about you know identifying this network
identifying behaviors and mobile device

106
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,280
makes a lot more difficult of course but
that spread across a lot of decoy files

107
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:27,150
and other things that lead you down dead
paths in addition you can go ahead and

108
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:33,230
apply passwords and then these passwords
get dynamically assigned to the specific

109
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,980
files to pick multiple passwords and
then those passwords are dynamically

110
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,360
assigned to the different files only the
recipient who knows about this who

111
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,959
receives the files can of course use the
same app and any relevant passwords to

112
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,479
go ahead despite her and also set aside
the deep balls themselves

113
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:58,738
high tech pros also pretty cool app
available for Android as well as Windows

114
00:09:58,739 --> 00:10:01,889
foreign I've used in the Android it's
pretty cool

115
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:06,478
heights and forth in and out so what
looks to be kind of an innocuous

116
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:11,539
multimedia at 15:02 click on it ten
times in a row it will unlock the hidden

117
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:16,679
feature which now appears proxy for your
password that you set when you initially

118
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,999
installed it and then allows you to go
ahead and hide data and then send that

119
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:30,809
steganos data in a over a file to rubber
you may want to send it to an end of

120
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:41,769
course there's apps for iOS as well such
as I S and also spy pics alright so I

121
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:46,169
did some research and two weeks ago
without a nozzle Norway to speak at half

122
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:52,799
and was kind of interesting I had found
a pen bypass vulnerability for the

123
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,348
Samsung smart watches and what's
responsible disclosure wrote a hacking

124
00:10:58,349 --> 00:11:03,209
tool around it and Emmert it at DEFCON
last year Samsung by the way was awesome

125
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:07,289
to work with and they issued a patch so
I thought that was like the interesting

126
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:13,399
aspect of the presentation that I did in
norway but quite frankly what was most

127
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,669
fascinating I had a lot of people asking
questions about was actually sharing

128
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:22,239
apps and their behaviors and in
particular one that I'm going to

129
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:29,719
highlight here so they'll be posting
more detailed a SmartWatch security

130
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:35,959
research that that I presented at on
their site so this is a particular trust

131
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:36,899
you around

132
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:41,499
SmartWatch risks to the enterprise and
various types of hacking on smart

133
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:45,309
watches that's what the presentation
were broadly covered and I'll be posting

134
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,769
that to the site but let's focus on
mobile app criminal

135
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,969
so of course many of us have smart
watches today and when you go to use

136
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:00,230
these smart watches quite commonly
there's a pairing out armed that's

137
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,980
either comes by default in your iPhone
if it's your Apple watch were peering

138
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,259
out that you can download for the
relevant south or whether it's for

139
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:14,689
Windows whether it's for iOS or Android
an interesting aspect about that is

140
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:19,809
carrying out its not really required so
you can still many times where you were

141
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:31,670
a smart watch with your mobile device
without the need for the pairing out in

142
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:37,279
the research lab took three common smart
watches and then kind of an uncommon

143
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,949
watch and just we had like a nice
cross-section her research they included

144
00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:46,258
the Samsara I'm here to neo which
doesn't actually run Android rare but

145
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:51,970
runs Tizen Samsung's lot of the smart
watches to the tyson platform we also

146
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,319
tested the Apple watcher course runs
wacho ass

147
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,939
additional rate tested the motor 360
which arguably the most popular Android

148
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:06,160
we're smart watch and then fourthly this
random room watch we decided to buy off

149
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,839
of ebay which I now determined this by
far the most common SmartWatch you can

150
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,079
buy on eBay

151
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,359
known as the the UN a weird embedded
operating system known as nucleus so if

152
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,489
you are concerned about the Android
fragmentation just take a look at smart

153
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:26,569
watches the quantity of different
operating systems out there is pretty

154
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:30,939
mind-boggling so one of the

155
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:37,650
under realize things that we found in
our research was you know this this

156
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,520
Chinese SmartWatch were certainly
suspicious about it couldn't find much

157
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,079
are right about it when we got it came a
little slip of paper with a random IP

158
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,420
address for you could download the
pairing out for either iOS Android and

159
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,719
so of course we do this in a test lab
what's up we could crash and burn with

160
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,210
and so we went ahead and installed the
pairing out we started to do some

161
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,670
dynamic analysis and behavior analysis
and one of the things we actually

162
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:14,650
discovered was that once compared the
SmartWatch with our iOS and Android

163
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:19,420
devices that started communicating
outbound over a random IP address to

164
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,260
China we don't know what the IP was it
didn't result anything and it wasn't

165
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,260
over encrypted channels very difficult
to determine what it was actually

166
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,410
sending but it was definitely suspicious
is definitely a mobile app right

167
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,420
preparing our related to a SmartWatch
and so you know in terms of corporate

168
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,040
espionage in terms of data exfiltration
in terms of data wrists there's

169
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,449
definitely a lot of interesting
suspicious behaviour there were taking a

170
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,450
closer look at this in the next version
of a report that we release will

171
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,100
hopefully have some new insights into
that but it did prompt me to write a

172
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:02,300
tool that's cool I wrote is attack
attack and be either a hacking tool work

173
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,680
can be a forensics a position to all so
again if you have an individual that

174
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:11,219
you're investigating you have suspicions
around corporate espionage you can go

175
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,250
beyond just actually looking at the
mobile device and looking at the mobile

176
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,320
apps but if there is a relevant
SmartWatch involved on there are ways in

177
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,270
which you can acquire the data from it
and perhaps even find that hidden data

178
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:32,230
on it I extended it even further when I
demonstrated at DEFCON and spoke about

179
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,230
was that you could also use it to hide
data to

180
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:43,040
so some of the ingredients for running
this a lot of times when you wanna

181
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,480
interact with these smart watches you
need to download the relevant STK as he

182
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,780
mentioned a lot of her run a plethora of
different operating systems and

183
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:58,610
different versions in this example ran
this with Samsung returns ties and

184
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:06,140
search used their ties in SDK and then
in addition to that I used Python USB

185
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,990
cable if you're running an Android where
device that a rich communicates over

186
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,900
Bluetooth it is possible to use the
Android deeper bridge to communicate

187
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:20,840
over Bluetooth and connect to the
SmartWatch as well so I went ahead and

188
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,710
took advantage of the fact that I could
acquire the data from the device the

189
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,080
suspicious device that you may be
investigating and furthermore a lot of

190
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,610
these devices don't require a pin and
they have no resident encryption on them

191
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,500
but even in the case where may require a
pin

192
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,280
we found a variety of different 10
bypass vulnerability is that still

193
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,839
allows us to not necessarily get to the
interface on the SmartWatch to connect

194
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,750
to it via the USB by past 10 do
curtilage escalation and acquire the

195
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,630
data from the SmartWatch and just a
little bit of output from the spot act

196
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,410
all

197
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:07,099
all so of course all these mobile
devices and communications have

198
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:12,069
implications in terms of their network
communications in this case over wifi

199
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:19,010
for a long time there's been this
capability in in windows to do virtual

200
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:24,109
wifi and it still exists today as it
worked with a lot of organizations over

201
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,559
the years and still quite surprised that
most people are not not aware of this

202
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:33,200
capability it does allow you to set up a
virtual like what looks like an actual

203
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,380
physical access point in a virtual
nature

204
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,179
far above and beyond and ad-hoc network
like were traditionally used this

205
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:47,750
virtual wifi then can be set up as a
rogue AP and can possibly used to be to

206
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:55,500
communicate correctly over some kind of
covert channels setting it up is quite

207
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
easy just requires a few commands from
the command line

208
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,590
and in addition you can define hey
people are going to be connecting to my

209
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:12,010
virtual wifi on my Windows laptop what
level of security do I want to use or do

210
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,320
I want to use not at all so I could set
this up a lot of people to connect

211
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,370
through my laptop to the corporate
network the implications of this are

212
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,260
quite interesting because whether the
laptop is physically connected to the

213
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,549
network or over to secure wifi you can
allow somebody in the neighboring

214
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:36,330
parking lot and neighboring building or
someone else nearby actually have access

215
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,960
to the corporate network and circumvent
all of your best security and terms of

216
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:48,750
wpa2 enterprise yes encryptions to the
gets in all of that so in terms of

217
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,049
laptop you set up the virtual wifi user
comes in for the day

218
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:57,529
next to the corporate network say her
physical network cable then proceeds to

219
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:02,990
share that out over the virtual life I
may be just an open network and all

220
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,080
anybody including the malicious intruder
to remotely connect in and steal the

221
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:13,939
data through that actual laptop and in
our testing this also works over

222
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,230
enterprise access points he's in the
best level of encryption any other type

223
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,960
of authentication schemes the sense that
laptop which is a sanction device is

224
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,630
allowed to connect to the corporate
network let's say using certificate

225
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:32,850
based authentication AES encryption WPA
two enterprising cetera now that he's

226
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,699
indicated in on the network he can then
set up that virtual wifi and share that

227
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,740
out any user he wants as an open WiFi
network and just have a clear pass right

228
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,860
into the corporate network

229
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:54,729
of course this creates a nice channel as
well a lot more localized but

230
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:03,179
nonetheless lousy this really nice axle
Terry filtration type of mechanism how

231
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:08,920
do I detect this well if you take a look
at the packets with Wireshark of course

232
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,870
we're looking at this from a wifi
perspective 99% of you know a lot of

233
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:18,469
these wifi packets are more around rare
to them they are layer 3 and above and

234
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,860
as a result even if I'm not associated
to the access point I can go ahead and

235
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,520
her viciously sniff the wireless network
and I can see all these handshakes

236
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,700
everything from the probe requested the
probe responses files and now if you

237
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,980
actually wanted to check this behavior

238
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,070
you'll see that got devices that are
communicating both as a client as well

239
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:46,030
as an access point right you'll see
beacon packets coming from an actual

240
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:52,020
access point but realizes the same
device as an actual physical laptop in

241
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,900
your environment

242
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,980
taking this a step further

243
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:01,850
went ahead and modified a dd-wrt and
allowed us to go ahead and take

244
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,459
advantage something called beacon
stuffing stuffing is actually concept

245
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,510
that believe it or not that Microsoft
came up with which we're delighted to

246
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:14,660
hide data into information element or IE
field of an actual beacon packet of

247
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,950
course we can packets are wide open on
authentic aidid and just randomly

248
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:24,210
communicating clear text and as a result
there are a lot of unused fields in the

249
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:29,270
Beacon packets including I field and so
are able to inject and hide data in this

250
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:35,720
i feel 256 bytes and randomized that
overtime check communicate data or these

251
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,440
beacon packets just seemed to be just
randomly

252
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:47,580
broadcasting with hidden data in a
little bit more insight into an actual

253
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:53,250
package where you could possibly high
data as demonstrated in there are booked

254
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,539
and some presentations in the past for
example at DEFCON in hiding this data

255
00:21:58,539 --> 00:22:02,879
and he's beaten packets thus allowing
you to communicate that even over enemy

256
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:14,219
lines if you are and just a Wireshark
packet capture that she's kinda what

257
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,879
that looks like communicating and
collecting the Beacon packets and then

258
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:27,879
deciphering all the relevant fields and
including information on it feels so in

259
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:33,309
terms of mitigation prevention you know
I kinda covered a broad spectrum of

260
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:39,389
different types of threats ranging from
mobile remote access Trojans RME wraps

261
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:43,918
to a lot of various types of cover
communicating data hiding types of

262
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,169
mobile apps two different types of
techniques that we've seen across summer

263
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:54,370
the SmartWatch carrying out that could
also allow for road covert

264
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,989
communications unbeknownst to the user
and even an enterprise environment and

265
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,860
then lastly also the ability over wi-fi
which you could you reply to these

266
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,500
mobile devices and communicate various
types of corporate data as well in terms

267
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,269
of the detections though there are a
variety of methods you could take

268
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:16,899
traditionally seen people try to
blacklist mobile apps with their MDM

269
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:20,789
Meridian then use some kind of a
permutation or mobile threat prevention

270
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:27,059
taxi categorize these apps on an ongoing
basis across the App Store Google Play

271
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:34,019
and the Windows Store furthermore
mapping out a lot of these apps that are

272
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:40,019
not even in the curated out stores in
addition some of these apps are actually

273
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:45,379
require maybe sometime sideloading were
actually that the device be rooted or

274
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:46,199
jailbroken

275
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,180
in order to install the app so if you're
doing that you know compromise

276
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,640
jailbroken

277
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,510
detections on certainly there's a lot of
capabilities you could leverage their

278
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,590
and furthermore

279
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,780
categorizations and reputation and
mobile threat prevention and then if

280
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,720
you're concerned about those wifi
threats and there are a number of

281
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:12,140
wireless IPS is out there that detects
mind as well said leaves just a couple

282
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,660
minutes left for choosing a

283
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:31,790
not detected we've been taking a look at
some of the network type of behaviour

284
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:36,680
for example we have seen some of the
apps over pollutes it does that mean

285
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,450
that they communicate over wifi I would
think likely so we haven't detected that

286
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,320
yet

287
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,330
one of the apps that I highlighted
earlier will allow you to communicate

288
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:56,879
over Bluetooth so Microsoft kinda did in
that they're trying to get retailers to

289
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,420
use it to send now

290
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,270
coupons like a blue light special when
you walk into a retail store they detect

291
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,270
that you didn't turn off the wifi on
your mobile device

292
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:13,320
maybe you have their particular app and
you get a notification that there's a

293
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,710
coupon because they detected during the
store so I know more thorough was

294
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:23,710
messing around with an Apple has a
little bit as well since then any other

295
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,580
questions

296
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:48,678
so the question was related to other
aspects of the actual cell like IMEI

297
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:51,460
UDID or things like that

298
00:25:51,460 --> 00:26:06,370
yeah yeah so it's kind of a good point
so you you're doing Wireless analysis

299
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,209
looking at the actual packets there may
be other aspects of bubbly I'm just

300
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:15,110
threw a fit dress that might be able to
correlate to the actual device you see

301
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:20,019
it in the area don't know where the
devices you know certainly 20 you I in

302
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:24,309
the MAC address will allow you to
determine like ok this is my last

303
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:29,340
devices this is a Dell device or you
know things like that so
