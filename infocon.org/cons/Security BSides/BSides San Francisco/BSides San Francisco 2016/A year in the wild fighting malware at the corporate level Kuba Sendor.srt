1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
related to what we do at the out when
things go nuts the way they should go

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:18,750
what some of our place machines and so
on so I joined up security in July 2014

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:26,910
season optimal Syrian both in dresses
response automation tomorrow

4
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:35,790
security processes related to that prior
I was working at the research security

5
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:43,129
and trust in Sapa in such antibodies in
process and before that I was the city

6
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:48,769
doing masters in computer science at the
University of Science and Technology in

7
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,739
Krakow Poland where emergency chrome and
then I i'm just a province or for

8
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:59,949
another couple of words but I guess
probably most of you know about it if

9
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:06,450
you're around here for a while so we the
people have great local businesses as

10
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,280
our main go and when it comes to see
some pics from the last quarter that

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:22,009
means that we had 86 million unique
visitors in our vacation ninety-fifth

12
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:23,810
unique

13
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:31,090
million unique reviews as 70% of our
success come up from mobile so that's

14
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,119
very interesting like to see them grow
up there and there in 30 countries so

15
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,900
it's going and it's very big already
what it means is we as a corporation we

16
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:50,299
have more than 3,000 people and more
than 300 of Mr engineers and instead

17
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:53,530
they from time to time to catch
something interesting on their machines

18
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,020
either it's something you really think
that what they do

19
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,610
privately or what they do for doing so

20
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:10,630
the way we tried to buy the the sort of
three pillars of our response process so

21
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,859
it comes to detection where he tried
basically to seattle also has something

22
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,650
went wrong we have to double dating you
made so probably machine open that door

23
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,760
tried to collect some four and six and
basically the things like recent

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,380
financials whole different side effects
that low let's prevent any further

25
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:39,380
possible things that could use the
discoverers

26
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:47,709
machine with the collecting for a six
figure out if this is for real or not so

27
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,820
we have a lot of false positives about
the late there so we have to figure out

28
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:58,690
if she's really impacting turnouts and
their loss is sort of a mediator so

29
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:06,220
making sure that something like that in
the future and it hurts like having less

30
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:14,430
less impact on our hour or so the
section this is something that comes to

31
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,760
us from various different sources so we
have sex among the virus on our place

32
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:29,810
machines and other monitoring software
like open source tool from Facebook and

33
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,000
we also have a couple of third party
proprietary network traffic monitoring

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,970
solutions but also alerts from time to
time and we build our own management

35
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:46,410
system which also collects bunch of
different information from us from his

36
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,490
first parks and other monitoring tools

37
00:03:49,490 --> 00:04:01,560
are on there things like I was very into
one big state storage and come from the

38
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,830
employees they're truly email or someone
is opening up this week at they usually

39
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:12,130
read into things like fishing somebody's
gotta sing some random browser toolbars

40
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,510
and follow-ups coming on and being quite
annoying so just come to us and say like

41
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,170
there's something we are you going with
my machine tennessee was there and they

42
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:30,280
will see they probably have some action
so the way we deal with all this

43
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,929
information coming in our automated
response to all this is basically trying

44
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,510
to make sure that when whenever virus
thought something we have actionable

45
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:47,510
means to provide some response for that
so what this ultimately responsible will

46
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:53,420
do is basically kind of way to process
the information from central machine

47
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,090
that collects all the information from
from are under viruses filter out

48
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,659
potential to create something like white
list of the things that we don't really

49
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,470
care about and they really mean that
something is not that interesting and we

50
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,640
should rather concentrate on one hit in
the first place

51
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,289
linked right to match couple of
information like IP addresses to

52
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:22,760
employees office so no location the user
actually I like that we can have a

53
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,599
homeless person will come and grab the
machine recent credentials for the users

54
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,110
and Southern Mississippi started versus
Boston also for our team for Omar

55
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,450
incident response team that ticket and
make sure all the information that we

56
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:45,510
have in there to provide some actionable
minister by the fight

57
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:53,780
what went wrong there is this typical
how this would look like a couple of

58
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,239
pieces of information they're like by
above which is probably the most

59
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,410
important for us as we say something
like execute them all on my machine is

60
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,930
not something we really care about the
first place so we try to get that out of

61
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:16,140
the first responsible says he's probably
some of you have about it is is very

62
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,820
interesting present when you can
basically

63
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:24,409
operating system this nervous like a
database and ask for Frances Carroll

64
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:31,610
extensions installed the machine user
login changes in the pension startup

65
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,090
items lunch and so on

66
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:42,580
we typically have a central instance
where we collect all the information

67
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,620
from

68
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:51,770
blinds installed on different machines
and we try to analyze incoming data to

69
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:59,390
provide information something is okay
not okay basically to do this whenever

70
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:10,810
they see some potential changes in
action on your machine so we paired up

71
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:18,090
with another told that we open source
which is called us learn this is

72
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:24,590
basically two other day so basically our
formation goes into central

73
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:30,570
elasticsearch Gloucester and then we
tried to using the lessons learned and

74
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:36,140
certain rules there whenever there is
some match operations here in his

75
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,630
already conceded there was

76
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:45,230
match with our blackness and there is
there is information like to the file

77
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,690
and the user

78
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:55,930
light and fire which is way to say which
machine is it just typically what we do

79
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,320
to formation resources are done that so
artists open source of error are

80
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:11,740
interested in checking out there is our
president there you can also be much

81
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:17,310
work on their own rules like relates to
their frequency ornate past five hours

82
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,850
later flight line which might be very
cool when you want to just check if your

83
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:29,260
system is not and also to see changes
are uncertain time frames so you have

84
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:42,880
differences even occurring in certain
time frame on that and other information

85
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,280
that we collect is from our DNS
resolvers this is very cool because you

86
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:55,040
can basically tell us eating too much
too much websites that we actually block

87
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,170
it's probable that he's not doing that
manual labor brother is something is

88
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,770
still on his machine which is trying to
basically request all these websites and

89
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,939
this probably indication there is
something wrong going on with the

90
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:18,300
machine we also use a lot smaller
turnout so basically we carry our DNS

91
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:26,000
locks collected about succession
instance

92
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,580
going to the next step

93
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:36,010
like previously said the dog days
basically way to figure out whether this

94
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,610
infection is actually a real there and
whether we're we're exactly coming from

95
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,700
in the first place so we may have a
couple of just you wasted figure out

96
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,790
something interesting interesting for us
in the first place by laying out the

97
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:57,719
false-positive this basically trying to
figure out this is Windows on the Mac

98
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:05,880
machine with Windows machine this are
usually way WAY less than the other one

99
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,980
and also try to figure out who is
because for a couple of dealer like

100
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:17,720
basically DNS bikes we may not be
entirely sure this is the right person

101
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,750
who may not have a schindler itself that
this is the right the right machine to

102
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:35,570
take a look at so we also have which
machine is it so going back to our

103
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:43,180
example of the spikes in the employ
heating various different websites well

104
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:50,010
there's like I guess around 20 of them
here but to look at stuff but well some

105
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,960
of them are ok they they're not
necessarily work late like Port au

106
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,220
Prince but they do not necessarily
indicate that there is already something

107
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,140
going on with the machine so we also
have to take a closer look at the field

108
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:09,750
the domain being up there and for
example oh yeah there are two of them

109
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,600
which actually have some heads only
their virus total things like OpenDNS

110
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,300
investigator and thanks to that we would
like see ya there

111
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,849
that there are certain websites machine
that there are there not really

112
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:33,550
something want to be seen our network
traffic so we try to correlate that with

113
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:39,819
other information sources that we have
in our hands so we look alike as a

114
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:47,330
grievous omission from Westbury also in
2006 and stunts and they suggest wearing

115
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:58,030
around the the machine that that's my
color and so usually a request from from

116
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,770
the particular house and then we'll have
like list of the extensions

117
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:10,939
browser extension follows installed on
this machine changes in the

118
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:17,540
configuration there is lots of lots of
town so is quite painful to go through

119
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,020
them manually as much as we thank state
are having our own blacklist and

120
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:30,540
whitelist to make faster but eventually
it comes down to ok you have the

121
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,349
potential of a couple of things that are
not looking that breaks they're not

122
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:48,190
really something about which is in the
any other stars and if you go around you

123
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:57,160
can see that yes some militias Safari
extension of odds and yeah this is not

124
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:15,000
something we usually like to see on your
machine

125
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,420
microbes and I gotta stand and basically
couple months after I joined will

126
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,269
consult at all

127
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:30,350
called OSX collector which is still too
basic for answers from the machine and

128
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:37,220
also a couple of extensions but still
there since trying to do some automatic

129
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:43,199
analysis out of this collect forensics
to highlight what's going on there but

130
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,029
typically the script is just one piping
file that you can just drop on the

131
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:55,860
infected machine running there and it
will collect the forensics or you can

132
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,959
get that back and stock closes on the
machine that's not impacted and

133
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:09,018
basically used to figure out what's
what's wrong with machine potentially

134
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:20,260
infected machine so they got all this
information is basically my typically

135
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:30,040
doing similar things to 2006 like harold
ickes tensions browser extensions

136
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,099
things that are in the dollar's
directory of the machine also things

137
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,480
like browser history

138
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,009
basically what was a different channel
operations that deserves done prior to

139
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:48,339
getting around it looks to be sure that
we have in the future prevent that all

140
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:52,370
the information that was elected
governors is Lord and Jason Belmonte so

141
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,880
basically each item like are not
essential have their own Jason object

142
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:06,470
which will have a couple of cum on feel
slide shows filepath also 442 w will be

143
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:12,670
significant change his or her figuring
out whether this is something that's

144
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:18,170
coming from a trusted source like like
Apple in this example or something so

145
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:28,290
typically being well you call the White
House things like that and then we start

146
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,910
to do so basically will around this out
good couple of days before their

147
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:40,730
scheduled collect intelligence for us
like we will either check against our

148
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:46,380
internal black less than will run at
jewish we just sort of way off white

149
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,519
listing application so it basically
house information about

150
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,089
expected houses on healthy operating
system so we don't already information

151
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:00,639
does not so much interesting further
investigation then we will go and

152
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:07,680
collect her friends explore further
information from AP ice like this is

153
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,888
giving us information basically about
things that are not that great so it

154
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:20,949
will let us know how many different
viruses selected pick up this this

155
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:24,120
particular file or or a domain

156
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:31,640
the last one is is OpenDNS which we also
use of 40 figuring out what's what's

157
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:38,439
wrong with with with a couple of
different domains and also automatically

158
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:45,120
try to sort of feel their their browser
history to see like what happened

159
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,890
directly prior to today incident to be
more knowledgeable about websites he or

160
00:16:51,890 --> 00:17:00,150
she visited the user to an upset that we
we have basically the same Jason filed

161
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:05,760
that came and had input documented with
all this information so this is

162
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:13,750
typically the lots of information so
there is no way I was expected to

163
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:18,439
basically just provide you with a
shorter cell area what happened and

164
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,140
this'll basically summarizes you all the
really bad and so will highlight their

165
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:29,010
applications that were picked by by
result Bowl highlights from the history

166
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:41,090
so directly see well actually costs
potentially cause impaction

167
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,610
other is also open source so if you if
you wanna go check it out for yourself

168
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:53,830
our project and they're also part of all
is expected that's directly

169
00:17:53,830 --> 00:18:00,590
communicating with his different API /
other server virustotal and OpenDNS is a

170
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:06,199
separate project that we expect as the
library and we call them straight into

171
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,300
love it basically a way to call a
different API is from my phone so well

172
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,120
so if you're applying to extend your
tools with this information you can do

173
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,250
it as well

174
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:30,760
all we also thinks the report is
directed by our employees related to

175
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,990
fishing so this is the Piggly Wiggly
user guides email looks like Dropbox

176
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:43,050
files sure or someone sharing my Google
dry or yeah I one of our access getting

177
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,399
information about how you should
transfer me five million lower soon can

178
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:55,730
you do it so perfectly thing said that
secure for us

179
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:05,650
well you never know some of them are so
elaborate that even though it's a very

180
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,200
experienced user will fall to them so
it's also good to have some other

181
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,280
protection measures against that but
what we would do typically will get

182
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:24,730
things slide user reporting to us and
the email the big at which they

183
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,660
generally expected saying them to open a
document is we try to investigate what

184
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:38,120
what words came from so for the users
that we that actually reported to us

185
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,989
which is already great I guess like
minded person jumped on it so important

186
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:50,630
that we try to record them so we have
this company stickers who dis our moscow

187
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:57,820
do basically thank them for their
efforts to help secure but the important

188
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,260
part of that actually have a good
education program in place so make sure

189
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:08,100
you communicate stuff like fishing
there's all these different social

190
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:15,570
engineering practices are so all levels
in your your company the victim to them

191
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:23,730
what we also this we basically set up
this email address on employees know

192
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,680
about that they can report suspicious
amongst this is quite important because

193
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,990
it's good to have this like one source
where were we know we can respond

194
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:40,370
directly to its employees to help this
is always liked taking so why are they

195
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:47,239
can sometimes reaches us and also
something like some of the companies are

196
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,240
starting doing so no place like
automated email attachments can this is

197
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:01,600
interesting idea it's has some drawbacks
it has some size as well but there's

198
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,919
something again do as well on your own
if you want to have more that's a good

199
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,140
way of reporting station emails rather
than relying on on employees but I feel

200
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,230
like it's really important to you also
get power to the user somethin make sure

201
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,770
that everyone is on the same page when
it comes to reporting different things

202
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:30,690
that may go around your in your company
so typically 440 we received into this

203
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:36,630
report it to us by my employees to this
email address will try to analyze

204
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:43,580
semesters heather is very some massage
man to your email client in the first

205
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,540
place is a virus he will try to defend
our p.m. we tried to figure out the bus

206
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:54,139
user interaction just see for instance
it was from from their business contact

207
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,800
if it was from their business conduct
will be a bit more careful about the

208
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,200
nuts blocking this email sender because
it is important to block it they won't

209
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,080
be able to combine some important
business for example

210
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,019
important to trying to understand what's
the context there and Game Warden part

211
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:19,510
is also to figure out well as receiving
it because if there is one employee

212
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:27,010
reporting something but no one is
usually the case is we see the same

213
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:35,769
email but only one person reported in
another thing that you can do is go to

214
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:41,760
their website is run by OpenDNS that
they basically provide a way to survive

215
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,408
of crowdsourcing database of all the
friend phishing campaigns so you can

216
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:54,179
also be the only can search would you
received even so regular they basically

217
00:22:54,179 --> 00:23:01,210
done all this for you so you need to go
to all the steps yourself so go check it

218
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:01,990
out as well

219
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:15,529
remediation so what we doing well if
something is already there is so much

220
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:24,789
about that but this is sort of like the
last the last possible way to do it we

221
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:34,059
tried to do some other stuff as well so
we'll try to do things like trains DNS

222
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:41,990
resolution our firewall rules also
trying to go to our indicate there's a

223
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:47,880
compromiser so different blacklist and
whitelist the picture 8016 collector is

224
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:54,330
using to make sure that it's always
updated information there we just got

225
00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:02,439
stale for phishing campaigns we tried to
block someone who sent the email address

226
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:09,070
good idea is to maybe blog way back so
not make it possible for employees to to

227
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:13,899
send a message back to today Fisher

228
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:22,330
can use this information like the list
of your social security number please

229
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:30,879
designate to prevent the tunnel back to
the official and important thing as well

230
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:36,408
as is coming back to their employees
especially like larger fishing complain

231
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:41,940
you may have some going communication
from your team to say yeah you shouldn't

232
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,830
you should be aware that there is
something going on is also makes a

233
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,320
stronger message israeli President I
sense that they got previously from crop

234
00:24:49,320 --> 00:25:01,460
insight into fishing education going
back to all the three major steps if we

235
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:08,769
do like the tax analysis and remediation
in the best face he tried to cover

236
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:14,710
well first collected from various
sources make them actionable make sure

237
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,610
expect to happen in class waste time on
things like false positives or something

238
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:26,120
like our own glass analysis will
basically after collecting the princes

239
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:31,049
wills white car related information from
various sources that we receive and also

240
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:37,539
around someone to make analyzes to make
sure that things are reputable going one

241
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:43,570
by one each of the cases we see the
remediation well will be either the

242
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:48,879
machine he was really in fact it and
yeah they can call the results from the

243
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:53,909
analysis and making sure that our
thoughts are getting better and better

244
00:25:53,910 --> 00:26:02,430
along the way so also our black this
blocking educating users things like

245
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:09,860
that so that's that we do have nots
separator and i'd like seven stone

246
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:19,689
they're not something that we just tried
to follow you know so well should hire

247
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,280
we've heard a couple people in the back
of a hard time hearing you guys are

248
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,120
talking a lot and want to talk to your
neighbors would be great if you could

249
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,850
move to the lounge by their something
people here really want to hear what's

250
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:36,889
going on said that the people in here
that's better than ever hear me now

251
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,220
could go to the people here want to hear
what's going on here

252
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,380
heard that some people in the back here
what's going on since you're talking a

253
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,430
lot and want to talk I recommend going
to the lounge above or somewhere else

254
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:56,350
that we hear this gentleman here give
his presentation on top of the people

255
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,100
anywhere else

256
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:02,530
thank you

257
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:13,370
the lawyer also so as I was mentioning
this is the process that we sort of

258
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:23,000
tried to go from from from you know said
it's not something we just like follow

259
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,570
about never giving it our part so will
also try to make it better along the way

260
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:36,470
and the way we do it basically we tried
to make their response faster and more

261
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:41,320
accurate so we aim at reducing the
number of false positives is happening

262
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,179
around either trying to have better
tools basically updating our goals

263
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,620
giving them fresh today and whenever we
see some repetition also trying to make

264
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,300
sure that it can be automated so they're
doing something more than twice three

265
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,720
times will try to make a run script
there on that we are we said we use this

266
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,630
script will try to make it

267
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:11,190
including two into our response places
along the way so for instance combined

268
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:18,200
together with our ticketing system and
make sure that everyone is using it so

269
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,380
also important part of the whole process
is his education when there are any

270
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,420
changes on our way to make sure that
everyone in your organization is is

271
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,740
knowledgeable about town knows how to do
it so also make sure that everyone so

272
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:40,050
that there is and always exchange going
on around the different parts of the

273
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:45,840
investigation process to make sure
everyone knows knows how to use them and

274
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,020
everyone knows how to update any
necessary and the hours different pieces

275
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,629
are coming on their arms are defined in
our our our response

276
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:00,980
so this is pretty much what I have for
today if you have any questions I'll be

277
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:36,410
more than happy to answer them thanks
for listening

278
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:41,400
so the question is like the beginning
how the organization public with their

279
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:49,000
organization and how the process changes
change along the way so this is what

280
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,980
particular that ok we're growing like a
year since I joined like they're very

281
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,480
slight drop in Rowville

282
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,630
number of employees but especially I'm
still more like for like sales for

283
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:07,040
instance which are not necessarily
tech-savvy people but we still want to

284
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,460
make sure that they they're both using
machines and they're not getting

285
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:17,910
infected so it's basically trying to to
to make sure that in a way that look

286
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:22,900
like a bunch of alerts coming in to try
to respond as fast as you can and if you

287
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:28,600
see somebody turns into responses like
this one large campaign up acting most

288
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:35,469
of these errors you should have maybe
some targeted the response rather than

289
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:40,410
just following the step-by-step before

290
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:47,530
also helped us a lot was the very
beginning we have DNS resolution we were

291
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:54,899
not blocking traffic resolution level
this is basically like our commodity

292
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:00,890
Muller alerts like more than a half I
guess so so those very helpful so it's a

293
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:15,520
like you're not doing that the ad says
probably some other question I think the

294
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,050
question this what's was are in a hurry
and changing the tax system

295
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:25,010
bunch of things that I've mentioned that
the combination of results I've

296
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:31,710
mentioned we from the third party
proprietary software not so comfortable

297
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:45,220
grabbing a nice but really that's it
feels like we're gonna bury you know

298
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,370
like we are not married today that
that's my take on that always so so we

299
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:55,500
see something you like you know certain
third-party there's not giving us what

300
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:04,370
we want and that's really the best place
not really helpful for us but we will

301
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:09,330
decide to evaluate it and we could
possibly change so it's also I guess

302
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,189
we're not speak to make sure that your
tools are wide interoperable

303
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:18,500
need to change them from 14 party member
ten other like from one network

304
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:25,870
monitoring solution to another make sure
that you sort of interfaces in between

305
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:31,959
that and the other polls below will
change all the rest of your stack Ansell

306
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:38,190
where

307
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:51,269
there is the question is how much is a
rescue team I think we have around 15

308
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,950
people right now just in the core
security some of them around here so

309
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:04,240
many of them to say hi and we also have
like generally some security savvy

310
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,039
people in our team the other teams like
operations like we try to make sure we

311
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:17,690
have connection he retains neil's yeah
it's like very scarce but also not

312
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:30,679
communicating well with other similar
questions about them thanks and yes

313
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:30,950
