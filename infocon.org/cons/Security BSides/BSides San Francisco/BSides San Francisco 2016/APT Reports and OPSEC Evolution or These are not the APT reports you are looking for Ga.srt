link on the beginning session again we
have won the raffle coming up $100

5
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:28,820
Amazon gift card courtesy of Gemalto to
make sure you can infer that there's

6
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,500
also some t-shirts I think there's some
seizure / so friendly to go grab one if

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,280
you can find one in your size

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,219
otherwise this is getting ever ongoing
speak on ABC reports and speculation

9
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:50,829
about how you doing today so you're
enjoying these aren't the droids ok so

10
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:56,090
originally this was supposed to be an
hour ago CCC and then it was pushed down

11
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:01,800
thirty minutes at Kaspersky sauce and
now has 25 minutes something to keep the

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,990
introductions ungodly and usually do
this within Baras gets a lot of credit

13
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,699
for me and we just started so the clock
now the talk is obvious the apt reports

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:22,060
of evolution or as we like to call it
these are you looking for and the reason

15
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:32,140
for that is we think that most if not
very many of the more sedate simply so I

16
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,049
can use this num which I'm not saying
that but that environment right now many

17
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,750
of them are good many of them and we
would like to essentially simplify the

18
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,020
process

19
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,170
would like to show the evolution of the
actors while they learn what they do

20
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:46,979
with that

21
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,630
and suggest ways to close that
evolutionary specifically buy mp3

22
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,619
reports on how they can help us in the
position that offers some gonna run

23
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,479
through this as quickly as they can
while still making sense I do want a

24
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:05,130
couple months ago and people didn't know
what a PT's I'm gonna explain why doctor

25
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,560
or whatever to finish in you choose to
use their ego so let's start with a

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,530
story just to get an idea of what I want
to do was about time where we're forever

27
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,930
it's not a news story we've been there
we've done that that is fine but then an

28
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,019
apt report came out the rainforest 1 I'm
really aware of their benefits before

29
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:31,400
naturally but the one that truly to the
news and a security practitioner to be

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:38,380
honest I didn't really care said yeah we
know I mean sure the building in China

31
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,840
where they work which has been a call
reports matter to me any way whatsoever

32
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,280
but it did that reported in table when
you go talk to the board trying to get

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,950
funding or anything else this report
made a whole lot of difference for me

34
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:00,738
personally and for many others the
monthly reports and more importantly the

35
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:06,150
operations of APT 12 infrastructure was
significantly disrupted but they were

36
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,049
not alone we've seen many many other
campaigns for example stuck into stocks

37
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:19,410
and was very tight 500 K Muller very
very target specific very specific in

38
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:24,560
what he wanted to do on the other end
with flame within mustard was twenty

39
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,650
megabytes big every I'm imagining that
every single module they could have

40
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,889
everyone I am probably wrong but that's
what I imagine they put in there once

41
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:40,669
was a big hit for their intelligence
organization was behind the press says

42
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:48,299
either or whatever length without them
trying too much in the impact of an apt

43
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,060
1 reports that skill and boggle the mind

44
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,329
operationally there in trying to think
they have enough sex talk they try to

45
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,780
figure out what to do when twenty
megabytes of all there to get lost

46
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:09,310
so there's a logical so let's talk just
a couple goes they are skilled a

47
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,669
permission overtook J

48
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:18,509
as far as we know but also been used on
whoever specific targets in a way

49
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:23,910
encrypted so it only opens on specific
machine how do skill that you still that

50
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:30,020
how much effort you put into it to
create such a specific attack it was my

51
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,859
research along with some others such as
Microsoft in the Soviets and within the

52
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,259
stock a year ago it's easy they just
used in office

53
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,479
impact if they lose that do they care to
do not care for them to get this

54
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,030
capability supposedly run around like to
think they had these optic meetings

55
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:55,330
select the off seconds we see each
relevant here in 60 seconds why do you

56
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,159
need first of all you want to assure the
success of your permission

57
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,630
very simple you want to prevent the
detection of the operation was a success

58
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:13,759
and you want to prevent attribution
firstly I understand let solution is

59
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,720
important to understand what people
concentrate contribution I see the west

60
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,009
of a little efforts lol calling but
that's fine and there are all these

61
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:28,280
processes whether its regular software
development risk management we want to

62
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,280
see how much do we need to invest how
much need to stop are still what we

63
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:43,289
ought to reach more than that when these
compliments to markets rushing it is

64
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:44,500
never good

65
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,539
humility you try to scale the operation
you taking risks

66
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:55,040
and deployments how easy do you need to
sleep nighty guy teaching about the

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:03,770
security investigator USB key could be a
pain so generally every

68
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:09,719
I don't use that word lightly ever
report out there and there is based

69
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:16,910
somehow an epic failure comes down to
what can we do to learn from this and

70
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:25,770
use it against them better are still in
a way so we actually had a really good

71
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,340
example according to see if we could
actually reading there in how they

72
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,169
reacted to being exposed between 11 and
then a quote their primary concern seems

73
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:43,250
to be not getting caught again but we
don't you sort of visibility so we need

74
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:49,370
to guess now reports many of them are
good but with many of them I feel like

75
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,000
it's mainly made for PR purposes and
they're really huge essentially what we

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,250
get from them

77
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,310
commentators just working on other
people's work on trying to figure it out

78
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:08,950
so as a result there is a symmetry and
asymmetry in cyber cyber nowadays is

79
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,919
really a problem we're facing every day
when I'm going to that and for me

80
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,669
reports are good for that talkers
essentially being there other everybody

81
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:23,740
is learning every actor out there is
looking at these reports on how the

82
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:31,040
other hand just helps them so let's look
at the couple lessons learned just to

83
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,390
get started with you one very basic
command control servers IP addresses

84
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,210
compromised infrastructure is done we
have truck which was released by cast

85
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:45,950
and they were hijacking something like
traffic pollution goes in several years

86
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,248
in between

87
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:54,409
there is learning approaches the Stuxnet
and flame flame tattoo actually still

88
00:07:54,409 --> 00:08:01,739
had similar code in its ultimate
solution and then you never know when

89
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:05,758
Tiger I'm sorry if you don't know all
these campaigns that's fine was clearly

90
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,459
going to that later over beer correct
though the mosque everything was so

91
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,819
perfect

92
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,159
distribution of the attack who else
would care about these

93
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:22,519
in Spain Spain right everything will be
sold for even saying good this false

94
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:28,939
flag how can we really make sure enough
they started learning there are multiple

95
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:34,339
cost less for many many amputees right
to throw the researches out of whatever

96
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,000
they're trying to do

97
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,629
reports that's pretty cool what do you
actually get a lot of it all season the

98
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:49,829
kind of compromise some easy to setup
command control service medical doctors

99
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:59,189
not really effective nearly never
anything at all so this feels like it's

100
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:04,089
really confusing again what we actually
do it this to move forward so for me we

101
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:11,269
tried to reverse engineer attacks but
look at forensic data apt reports what

102
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:16,990
if we tried to use all the technical
investigation went in through this talk

103
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:25,600
and when other anybody who are all their
investigation went into this just to be

104
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,819
able to do one thing reengineer that
doctors methodology their operations and

105
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:39,569
technical information for this quickly
first thing they do and this is

106
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:43,029
simplified not really changes between
that doctors and country's intelligence

107
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:46,620
requirements is like going shopping what
would you like to know

108
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:57,089
examples are doesn't stain where are the
W does he intend to use these who is

109
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,730
working on WMDs

110
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,190
how can we get back we ever got the joke
thank you very much appreciated in

111
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:11,269
germany not so much now the second part
is you know what you want the target

112
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:16,480
list where can I find answers or
withhold information I need example

113
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,320
calls we get that the report sometimes

114
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,660
targets not so much again exceptions
were pretty hot right now they're just a

115
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,399
party needs to get far as I know they
take whatever they can we're not talking

116
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,820
about any exception
intelligence-gathering third step in our

117
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,190
simplified model first of all the target
reports you're trying to figure out how

118
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,449
to the target but it looks like we're
going to face all that stuff

119
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:48,800
nice Asian one in my plan of attack in
what toll a weapon would elect to use in

120
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,540
order to execute the person next let's
think about the specific tools such a

121
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,760
claim and gas and then using something
on the ground for example this Dell

122
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,680
SecureWorks report showed you can tell
Tara system i hope i pronounce it tries

123
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,359
in order to use that to me is that
organization to do what they want to do

124
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,040
one thing if it goes on this same
process can be on the outside of work

125
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,610
then instead of trying to people to do
not remove and it goes on and on and it

126
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:26,399
feeds on itself its intelligence cycle
so how many of us watched it on facebook

127
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,480
when it came out that much the whole
thing through right I'm gonna save you

128
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,430
the trouble so at this stage with the
back and think about intelligence

129
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:42,920
gathering and all that involves and
figure out OPSEC is important again how

130
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,149
do you plan attacks of course first
thing I would do even 10 years ago is

131
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:53,360
not the target do the other night late
care care unit stopped me to take the

132
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,120
risk then suddenly started thinking
about security vendors back and

133
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,699
communities when they put in silence you
can they try to figure out what they

134
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:05,899
doing retrospective installing right now
but they can find me later

135
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:10,350
complex though trying to figure it out
when you're back next

136
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:18,800
we have came out supposedly and as a
group and it was an apt magnets he was

137
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:27,329
found in a machine read the report and
one other apt thats all there what's

138
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:35,460
going on so again the formation so my
old apt is out there who looks for their

139
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,430
existence

140
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:41,420
they're going to get caught before
installing software that's on the

141
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,479
operation on information so you need to
really try to hide her identity now

142
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:54,660
that's what we get out of it and then of
course we have this example in the names

143
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,010
changed he says the crowd state name
they had an actual case to get upset

144
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:04,500
when they didn't care that much they
would do and then that doctor will

145
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,100
change they doing that on the network
for quite a while many doctors don't

146
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,950
really care when you starting incident
response to mind but they did run away

147
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,990
eventually according to reports looks
interesting to see no hearing your

148
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:26,010
report about Symantec report about the
US stocks and you can see for the

149
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,650
compilation time the infection time
things for example if you see a

150
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:34,750
compilation times at memoranda Shabbos
maybe there is really have no choice but

151
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,360
to give you information for example how
to compile time section time time to

152
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:50,100
inspect our own operation you can learn
a lot and everything was crumbles so

153
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,170
they do learn so let's take a quick call
these agents i coevolution

154
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:03,630
example though they like many other
creditors revert to OS tools for example

155
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:08,750
W my PowerShell and that's pretty much
what we're seeing is four strokes goes

156
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,730
into a two

157
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:16,310
in our example when you can never
happens

158
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:22,609
they were basically inspecting only
actually doing the work was really cool

159
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:30,750
to look at so there is another parts but
need to take into consideration which

160
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,250
haven't seen people will talk about and
that's what we call the fall retreat

161
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,990
part of the operation they have been
discovered now up so I want to speak

162
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,000
about three examples remain greatly over
the Chiefs months after publication

163
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,180
partially and fully two weeks whatever
and then the Masquerade we spoke about

164
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:54,660
this the was invented local Austin wrote
about it on the blog and four hours just

165
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:03,170
to name the match for hours later things
down and then look into PA to this is

166
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,260
gross my own interpretation don't wait
for the publication break into the

167
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,019
vendor they're going to do what they
want to release so there are certain

168
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:13,139
pollution here is a look at it that way

169
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:18,550
their counter examples of again
operating that's why I saw the defender

170
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,620
said this is really important to me it's
not perfect but that's what we gotta do

171
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:29,220
to start progressing in making money to
us so we're gonna talk about problem

172
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,779
takeaways in solution based on the
simplified model just waitin for all

173
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:39,050
employees rights much more complex
composed intelligence requirements

174
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:44,529
the problem is not enough information
what are the objectives we don't always

175
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:53,439
know about our as they look at how can
get more like having a stalker when they

176
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,829
like you they really like you really
like you they're not gonna stop yourself

177
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:08,479
this is an example from RSA October
death one shows an example when they

178
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,040
were attacking they started to use in
response to what the rest of the weekend

179
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,000
and came back again with slightly
improved lateral movement all they're

180
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,180
not gonna give it up most of them

181
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:24,479
I'm an interesting to me number to
stealing days just one option and

182
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,830
everybody wants everybody not surely but
a lot of people were surprised that saw

183
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:34,100
me think about it for a second we know
what a Trojan horse can do it is

184
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:41,790
organization do they know something else
but you haven't seen here and go to keep

185
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,480
on top of that stuff so still there is
just one of the options we just go out

186
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,670
what else they can do once they're
inside and we know they're inside so

187
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:55,329
site to Sami the main action and all the
way back to boring security risk

188
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,370
assessments risk assessments are boring
documents we have absolutely no used

189
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,609
mostly for compliance this big if not
bigger and withdraw the way them and

190
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:09,990
they're done a risk assessments tickets
reasonable tactical operational

191
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:17,170
you can also use it for something else
that could be useful for us and that's

192
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:24,990
my taken second compile target least
there in no time since the information

193
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,420
out there

194
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:31,280
reports they mostly meaning no pattern
is really hard to do better recognition

195
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:41,110
now though is if you have similar data
or platform on any organization

196
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,439
organization you can know you're on the
list and more than that you can perform

197
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:54,240
a threat the system for some intense
capability to see what's going on and

198
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,100
did because of their final cell systems
make sure their voices are securing

199
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,209
what's going on there

200
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,410
37 given cycle talk about a little bit

201
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,470
engagement stage publicly available
system is not really their security

202
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,220
awareness it's pretty much an issue that
could you get along with your network

203
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,500
that's fine

204
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,010
the public information which is blowing
my mind right now

205
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:27,220
but there's nothing better than this
dick engagement stage not many sheriff's

206
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:35,340
reports please turn down that they go
and engagement there are many you're not

207
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,590
alone in this game and lost his many
obstacles can overload security

208
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:47,720
reception area he tells in Falkland
retreat that doctor can destroy the

209
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,080
forensic evidence even going to say when
I'm gonna back it up right now I'm just

210
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,189
saying it's possible I'll look at this
log mother lots and adjust for

211
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,300
monitoring today we based our security
incident response and that is the case

212
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,680
that came out in a really important
snapshots of the day love skip them and

213
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,040
backup your blog or instant response
that can destroy their evidence it's

214
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,120
pretty simple actually made a name for
this my partner in crime get burp

215
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,760
response month this is important make
sure you have the data you can try this

216
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,220
at home

217
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,800
essentially you have two things we
talked about we have the type of data

218
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,680
that you actually have an apt reports
CNN report comes out 24 how much you

219
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,860
actually have to rely on to go through
this engagement process figure out what

220
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:46,729
you can do for defensive IOC's if you do
the more you'll get more and that is my

221
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:53,080
personal take away from this now there
is something else like to talk about and

222
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,169
I something we like to call the decline
of shame it seems to me almost like a

223
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,710
beauty reports have come to a point
where they've been doctor is no longer

224
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:05,030
care about what you know the first time
I thought he saw they lost

225
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,940
infrastructure with Eric sign away
quietly nowadays people get caught they

226
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,870
don't even care to keep moving up there
for a minute and just having fun with

227
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:20,229
this but there is a solution and the
mindset in consideration

228
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:27,870
we would like to see better more action
reports many of them are very good many

229
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:37,040
of them are the information to mount
them number to earlier reports hate you

230
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,020
can give us a heads up and we know your
vertical is targeted that's where the

231
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,790
importance and we know the type of clots
forming at that that's really important

232
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,520
a lot of these shares closed circles
most of this is not think about it

233
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,530
third actionable public information
sharing I was very worried about

234
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:58,230
actually saying this for many many years
anybody from the airport initiatives in

235
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:03,090
the security space but I believe in this
if you got to share more information

236
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,020
will be amazing and that's that

237
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,450
and loss I understand a little people
wanted to do something with the lizard

238
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,560
brain and can help with policy but
enough already

239
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:23,600
contribution it's not the most important
thing is we have shown please okay so

240
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,149
we'll talk later please for me

241
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:37,230
ok no public reports follow warrants
reports can be a huge help they really

242
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,920
can think about it he said there in QA
for the tuckers but it's more than that

243
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,510
when you release the report they are
hurt you imagine fashion police report

244
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,340
that helps us create the defense we need
they'll be really great which means we

245
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,550
want them the Tigers tix keep releasing
the information

246
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,550
relevance does help make it better

247
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,580
essentially let's increase their costs
everything I do for my startup to any

248
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,159
project on hold with other people
talking about the asymmetry in their

249
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,710
past you can change this cost of the top
players in the tax that's all I really

250
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,200
care about personally and this is
something I think abt reports can really

251
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,850
help with thank you very much and if you
have any questions that would be most of

252
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,469
us are but I will say he's been very
quick there is an entire research behind

253
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,850
it if you're interested

254
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,559
sure thank you very much

255
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:41,860
two minutes from now on we got we got
time for questions just raise your hand

256
00:22:41,860 --> 00:23:00,168
I'll come find you gotta question yes No
thank you thank you so much and again on

257
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:05,899
behalf of b-sides and sponsors Fitbit
Fitbit thanks thank you
