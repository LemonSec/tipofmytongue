1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,860
its ok I get all the glory now right
well I'm lame gotti for almost

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:15,940
everything so I want to use it too much
people figured out that I'm doing it

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:22,410
though is a fall for everything in the
world but ok so let's begin

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:30,948
so basically already consumed slides
great so we'd like to understand how a

5
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:34,219
better honey pot can be built her
learning from the current work and

6
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:40,200
understanding their religious laws and
design considerations read so basically

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,329
the stock one be about finding buffer
overflows or stuff like that in many

8
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,680
parts of be more like the design
principles and I would actually like to

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,420
do a honeypot that works well and
actually deceives advanced attackers

10
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,800
like we haven't seen over the last few
decades since on reports of been around

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,770
by the way just about the presentation
feel free to raise your hand if you have

12
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,720
any questions feel free to drop me I'm
israelis so I don't really think

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,908
anybody's you know trying to insult me
or anything I'm used to it so so sorry

14
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:25,159
terror ok so basically what has
reception and what is hype but useful so

15
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,119
when we want to do some reception we
want to be doing as we have an attacker

16
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,689
within our network or within you know
the public-facing assets to we have we

17
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,008
want him to do stuff that we direct them
to do by his definition of being an

18
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,149
attacker and the most basic example

19
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,259
as honey pot so there's been many honey
pots before it all started with Rick

20
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,619
Owens assumption toolkit than there were
last at Schneider the honeypot projects

21
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:58,810
and many many more

22
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:07,090
efforts and basically what intrusion
deception changes in the game as instead

23
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:13,660
of trying to find that exploit or that
our sample what we're trying to do is

24
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,660
find the attacker himself right we're
trying to target his method of operation

25
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,130
instead the technologies using which is
something that is much more hard to be

26
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:32,049
flexible on much harder to change and
basically that's what we are trying to

27
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:36,829
write as soon as an attacker is within
our network or trying to find some sort

28
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:42,069
of one of our public facing us he
doesn't know what he's looking for and

29
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:47,768
even if he gets entry into our network
and yes some sort of information like

30
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,790
that foghorn do we know from video games
he doesn't know where he needs to go and

31
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:59,388
that way we can trap and to do what we
want to do right and there's this their

32
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:01,430
first concept called E

33
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,200
little and basically what it means is
observe orient detect an act and fighter

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,810
pilots X in that same process as do
cyber attackers they always trying to

35
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,590
figure out what they want in their
harmon's directing them towards the next

36
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,260
update want to make and if we're and
flirt influencing that observation

37
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:33,429
period then we can control her actions
so this is the easiest example honey pot

38
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,250
this is a lot of people to make this a
real about metaphor because the wily

39
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,640
coyote always loses to the roadrunner

40
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:49,880
but actually as you later senior
lecturer at a show that's right so why

41
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,470
do attackers

42
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,170
something that's very efficient against
attackers why does it even interested at

43
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,140
all when we're defending a network and
the reason being is that what we're able

44
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,649
to influence the attackers methods were
you able to do is hit them where it

45
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,820
hurts right so the only things attackers
care about is the amount of effort they

46
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,070
need to do to achieve what they're
looking for right and if we increase

47
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:24,040
that amount by a lot then we're
impacting their way of operation writes

48
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,950
for example we capture their there all
day exploits or recapture their malware

49
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,520
samples then it's very very hard for
them to be flexible and replace that

50
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,830
easily so that's the thing they're
afraid of losing and there we see that

51
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:46,609
there's an economic change and how
defense against attack works right so

52
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,710
regardless of how you do it in the end

53
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,640
intrusion deception comes down to
something very basic and that is the

54
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,960
decoy right now will honey pots are a
private chase of the decoy will talk

55
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,710
about how they do it what they try and
do all see how they fail at doing that

56
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:13,310
mostly it's very simplistic and the end
right there is some sort of asset is

57
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:18,479
looking for and we're giving him what he
wants and only two attackers will be

58
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,479
interacting with that has said and not
any regular use

59
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:33,320
queso and huge benefit from this as that
and theory will never have any false

60
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,150
positives right because if for example
we have this machine that we've put up

61
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,679
on the network and we're the only ones I
know about it nobody should be

62
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,090
interacting with nobody should be
touching it as soon as there is

63
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,429
something new on the machine that can
happen from just tired all traffic in

64
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,990
the network than we know by definition
that this is an attack right there's no

65
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,900
false-positive no other research
required we know this is definitive

66
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:07,520
alert right so let's talk about a little
bit what's to say the core technology so

67
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,870
most of the money pac's the most
prevalent and popular projects are

68
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,060
what's called a lower action honey pot
which will go into explaining and

69
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,960
they're mostly usable for malware and
you know automatic exploit detection but

70
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,570
they're very limited and the reason
being is there to try and emulate a

71
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:36,900
specific target and a very well-informed
or a relatively well informed attacker

72
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,280
is able to realize that and the worst
thing about planting an ambush as

73
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,469
planting an ambush that the attacker can
finds right because then by using

74
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,660
deception that's obvious your not only
losing the effect of deception he also

75
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,630
risking your assumption that you're able
to the scene of the attack and for

76
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,430
example in honey pots the basic example
is if an attacker is aware of honeypot

77
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,580
held to a lot of you know traffic
against that while he's actually attack

78
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,789
came a different part of the network
because they'll draw your attention to

79
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:19,540
the funder ok so in contrast alone or
action honey pots we're just emulations

80
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,090
of that target

81
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,330
interaction honey pots are by the
definition of them are the real machines

82
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,070
the real target do you can attack

83
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:34,550
but the problem with them is if you want
to get the attacker to attack you need

84
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:41,130
to sort of get the environment to fit
with that high interaction honeypot

85
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,420
rights and attackers not stupid and if
he sees that something doesn't fit and

86
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:55,050
its environment until realize it's ok so
a sticker printing of our ability on

87
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,760
this is something that we came across a
lot while we were doing research so most

88
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,969
of the abilities will be showing you how
to detect honey pot some abilities also

89
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:11,440
use health also used that honey pot to
the attackers advantage on somewhere and

90
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,980
we feel this trigger printing is not a
code execution vulnerability but it's

91
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:24,080
more like it is a vulnerability because
it's our acting the purpose of the honey

92
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,950
public for example one of the worst
vernon police you can find tour is to be

93
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,909
able to reveal the original IP of the
browser not essentially during code

94
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,390
execution on the browser right so we
feel that isn't normally but there's a

95
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:48,650
lot of terminology limbo in there ok so
now into technical stuff so what's a

96
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,790
loner action honey pot that's generally
just a simulation of a specific network

97
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:58,439
service like Assemb SMTP DNS and more we
have an attacker is looking at the

98
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,070
machine from network perspective you
seen this machine with the specific

99
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,950
service starts interacting with that
service and now we can monitor what he's

100
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,430
doing because we wrote that service
specifically for that reason right

101
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:17,439
direction anybody's the actual network
service on machines for example real Dr

102
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,170
SMTP or DNS server on the department has
it's very hard to

103
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,560
implemented very hard to monitor because
then we need to realize how the protocol

104
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,319
works and then you know try and read it
all while it's real running inside the

105
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,800
actual diamond that's running so let's
talk about other people have tried to

106
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,609
the texts previously so one of the
cooler websites as as distant called

107
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,820
honey score it's on showdown and
something interesting about this when we

108
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,850
landed we couldn't get it to say that
something with a honey pot as hard as we

109
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,230
tried to like the popular honeypot
projects posted them online

110
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:09,529
gave it the address and then it would
still say that it's a real system and

111
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:13,579
then what happened was worth talking to
other people in the community we

112
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:18,550
realized there is this another project
which is called con pot and what it does

113
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,199
is it simulates honey pot for ICS or
SCADA system

114
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:29,189
industrial control system and this is
actually something that's been research

115
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:34,310
before how to the tax really like
embarrassing stuff so for example to

116
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:41,729
diesel name of SCADA system that would
stimulate was Mauser factory always and

117
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,459
soon as somebody found out they changed
it but then they realize it always has

118
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:51,880
the same serial number which is
something charming also found out and

119
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,019
and for example she looked for that
serial number on showdown you can find

120
00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:03,790
all the world's hosted and then we'll
figure it out oh now let's take that

121
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:11,319
address and finally were able to get
money scored 22 honey pot so their load

122
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:18,000
an end with I guess at least but I don't
think any other popular honey pot that's

123
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,550
what we did or not research

124
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,689
so what we'll be doing as well going
through I think around eight of the most

125
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,779
popular honeypot projects and will be
going from the most basic ones the most

126
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:36,579
complicated one in terms of closeness to
actually being something that can

127
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:44,079
receive an attack right so artillery is
a very popular projects what it does is

128
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:51,189
basically as you run into your machine
it selects a number of ports which have

129
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:58,459
hurry on services like port 80 for HTTP
other ports for DNS assembling whatever

130
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:04,589
and then when somebody tries to interact
with it just gives them garbage like

131
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:12,440
random crap and then blocks that IP
right and have a joke which I sager and

132
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,149
it usually doesn't work let's try it
anyway it's like coming up to a girl in

133
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:20,560
a bar and saying hi and then she just
says I have a boyfriend and runs off

134
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,640
like you don't even get a chance to have
any sort of interaction looks like this

135
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,029
time their work

136
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:30,649
courtesy last that's good

137
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:40,620
rate so as you can see artillery pretty
simple pretty nice to use but it does

138
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,940
nothing to try and actually deceiving
her and one of the problems that we

139
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,860
found out was that it blocks that I P
thats connecting to it without actually

140
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,910
validating it too much so what happens
is that there is no IP spoofing

141
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,829
protection within the network it only
takes two packets to make artillery

142
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:08,729
block any IP do you want this also works
on the gateway address so I'm just drop

143
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,540
that machine from the network completely
and I will not talk to anybody

144
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,050
I don't even want to try and relate that
to the jerk from before hands ever get

145
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:30,189
in trouble ok so what can we learn from
artillery is work perfectly that if

146
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,250
we're servicing a port that nobody
should be touching specifically on a

147
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,110
machine that can be servicing that
poured as soon as somebody is touching

148
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,360
it that's an indicator of a tech
activity right and now they're where

149
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,130
attackers and we know her tillery works
how does that affect our operations now

150
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,209
we need to consider everything we
connect to might be a trap need to check

151
00:13:53,209 --> 00:14:02,810
a focus in on the next bear trap their
trip is pretty similar to artillery and

152
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:08,079
only that that it does some amount of
actual implementation of the service

153
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:16,040
that it's doing but it also has a part
from trying to actually implement the

154
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,819
service that does nothing to hide it
it's you know actual function as a

155
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:27,069
honeypot so for example if you use the
FTP service and sorry for a bear trap

156
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:33,670
this is the default banner that you get
and I don't know how many land mines

157
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:40,560
that have a sign here is a landmine work
but this is a bad example and we also

158
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,779
wanted to find something that no matter
how you configure it still works so

159
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:50,610
another way we found out that you can
detect matchup is for every carry on FTP

160
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,310
returns just like 30 this is something
that for some of the functions for STP

161
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,209
will never happen by the definition of
the protocol is another way that no

162
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:03,459
matter how you configure their troubles
will be able to detect it

163
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:11,870
and specifically church and see an
example of all looks on regular server

164
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:17,690
and also probably bear trap is it
suffers from the same blocking IP

165
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:25,380
without in any way that artillery
suffers from so again if you are hosting

166
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:33,889
backdrop on your survey please be aware
that it's pretty easy to remove it so

167
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:37,300
what can we learn from bankruptcy is
actually implement the service launches

168
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:43,219
return random data and now those from
the attackers perspective we should be

169
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,610
on the lookout for indicators of the
substance and even if we're talking to

170
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,880
an FTP service should be looking at its
Tanner or where to inquiries we should

171
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,060
be realizing this is not the real
implementation of the service before we

172
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:03,089
actually do something that exposes us
like installing malware or connecting to

173
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:05,079
Cincy IP's or whatever

174
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:12,040
ok so now honey honey dias amor one of
the more famous ones out of all the

175
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,420
honey pots what's cool about as much as
much more platforms than its will so

176
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:23,180
lets you actually design your own
scripts that implement the specific

177
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:29,300
services and then put them in town EDN
used the thing is that trading those

178
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:35,810
scripts takes a lot of work he comes
with a bunch of under default and some

179
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,989
of the default ones suffer from the same
problems as we've seen before

180
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:47,180
for example doch das service when i
receive a specific get that its purpose

181
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,969
is to find

182
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:56,730
shellow execution vulnerabilities it
always returns the same value as you can

183
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,360
see the problem that is that this is a
service that doesn't know what he's used

184
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,849
in 16 years from the date of the
directory answer this is not very

185
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:11,539
believable and also returns the exact
same answer all the time so the number

186
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:18,890
of bytes reason is the same 290 members
pretty easy to recognize some of the

187
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,799
other scripts suffer from the same
problems in any case I'll be obvious an

188
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:30,549
attacker whose interacting with honey do
that it's actually I'm doing ok so a

189
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:35,400
possible fix for the IAS example would
be to return an empty journalists and

190
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,030
render our eyes the timestamps and the
by Councillor volume serial number

191
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:46,740
periodically as you can see trying to
you know just even attacker becomes a

192
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,710
lot of hard work because we're trying to
figure out all these sort of my new

193
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,940
details that we need to understand about
the protocol to change in order for it

194
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,610
to be believable and what can we learn
from these workers that we should

195
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,539
implement the service is no obvious
indication sold the indications we find

196
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:10,900
in our implementation issues and not you
know purposefully trying to directly

197
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:18,640
target to realize that this is an
architecture should be realizing that if

198
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,240
the service is implemented only
partially like some of the commands are

199
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,630
implemented or other stuff don't behave
as they should just could be a honeypot

200
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,630
more often than not

201
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:38,010
next up is no jacinto has actually a
pretty cool tool what it does is take

202
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:45,240
SunnyD and a bunch of other open source
tools which are not not trivial to

203
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,809
configure and it takes them on puts a
graphical interface and gives you like

204
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:54,830
very easy to use tools for example you
can just create a Windows machine on

205
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,779
your network

206
00:18:55,779 --> 00:19:01,039
a Linux machine and just you know saddam
operations only with wizards and and get

207
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,539
them going one of the problems is that
if we take a Windows machine created in

208
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:11,629
November then we can see that they were
trying to connect to it through the net

209
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:17,289
by US Armed Service it displays as if
it's an open port allows a connection

210
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,289
but it doesn't do anything the sites up
so says the connection is established

211
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:26,070
you don't get any answers on any queries
and this is a situation that never

212
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:32,229
happens on a Windows machine it's either
firewalls off or answering on that bias

213
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:37,679
this is the only two states and
assumptions could be a definition means

214
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:44,029
this is and possible fix of that would
be to get the latest version of honey to

215
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:47,759
which they did but or just you know

216
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:56,869
1394 so what can we learn from overseas
work implementing one service very well

217
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:01,158
as not enough jobs to implement a
package of services to make the machine

218
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,830
look believable so for example to could
have had a lot of other services that

219
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,529
were really great but then closing off
as a Windows machine and not having done

220
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:16,419
that by US service just tells you and as
an attacker who should look at the whole

221
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:23,070
and be made aware when the set of
services doesn't makes them so next up

222
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,070
is capo

223
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:31,529
local project what it does is try and do
something they call medium interaction

224
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:39,089
what that means is they tryin hosts a
necessary to complete an attacker could

225
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:43,460
log into the secure show and actually
use it and run commands and their

226
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:51,460
simulating everything and there were a
bunch of different previous attempts to

227
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,549
research how to find capo most of those
attempts were patched ought to keep

228
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:59,658
putting which are actually very
professional and they react pretty

229
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:04,039
quickly to these problems we did
responsible disclosure of them they

230
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:10,950
fixed it very quickly and what they were
trying to do is actually implemented W

231
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,849
get commands and the interesting thing
about that was they wanted her to gain

232
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:19,149
entry into the SSH and then use double
get to download dermal our sample on

233
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:24,099
running right or their script takes
command of the machine and they wanted

234
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:28,330
to get that they wanted to be able to
enable the attacker to download it

235
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,908
because then it helps a lot with
mitigation so one of the previous

236
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:38,509
problems with keeper was that in the
essence occasion protocol it would act

237
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:47,409
in a way that doesn't doesn't happen in
any other indication of telling you

238
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:54,849
which protocols supports before you ask
it to a way to identify people without

239
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:58,809
even opening connection to it so you can
keep it wouldn't be alerted that

240
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:02,839
somebody try to connect with it was
clear cut detection but they fixed that

241
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:10,089
actually and we tried and found more
systems so that way you connect to keep

242
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:15,849
machine is you just use the username
root and the password 123456 but then if

243
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:20,649
you write you name your name command
which tells you the banner for the

244
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:24,498
operating system it always gives the
same results and specifically what i'm

245
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:35,549
showing hear it from the source and and
what happens is is dead if you look up

246
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,309
that you named specifically that time
stamp in Google what you get is a lot of

247
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:45,729
Stack Overflow I T people are saying I'm
trying to connect this sh machine in

248
00:22:45,729 --> 00:22:50,219
network is acting really weird have no
idea what's going on can somebody please

249
00:22:50,219 --> 00:22:55,769
explain what happened here is the
details of the machine please help me

250
00:22:55,769 --> 00:23:02,169
write so even unaware on security like
people when they're using people they

251
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:05,049
realize something is off

252
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:12,149
identified a possible fix will be at the
actual machines timestamp for randomized

253
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:19,229
on this by the way to fix hippo actually
did what can we learn from campus

254
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,309
lockdown epub becomes a tool for
collecting forensic data on top of

255
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:28,070
detection right so for example knowing
that we have an attack on the network as

256
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,499
much less valuable than knowing that an
attack on the network and gaining it's

257
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:36,940
cool that they're using to connect back
to machines or running you know their

258
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,580
malware or collecting tolls on the
machines because that allows us for

259
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,580
mitigation much more than just being you
know where that there is an attack on

260
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:51,769
the network so how does that affect our
tucker now doctors are worried I'm not

261
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:58,980
only being detected but using their
tools so if I'm an attacker of this

262
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,220
awesome privilege escalation Lennox and
I go and I W get her on it on a chipper

263
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,980
machine I tried that privilege
escalation o'day

264
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:18,519
afraid I'm not only you know might be
able to lose by Jay defender being aware

265
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:26,659
might actually lose assets that have
worked hard on the next up is Danny and

266
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:34,200
diana has the best intentions out of all
the projects and this is just what we've

267
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,049
talked about this all go through this
denny's intentions to trap malware

268
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,869
exploiting vulnerabilities exposed by
services offered to network

269
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:46,710
ultimate goal is gaining a copy of the
malware

270
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:51,779
so this is this is the right objective
this is the cream of the crop the cherry

271
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:56,399
on the icing on the cake do you can get
through using deception that's what I

272
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:00,178
near tries to break and

273
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:05,970
what does will give us as effective
mitigation not just section so for

274
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,249
example in the past

275
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:12,759
Daniel also had issues one was that if
you would do an nmap scan of the NEA

276
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,499
georgette

277
00:25:14,499 --> 00:25:19,259
sequel service that would host and the
embassy Khomeini would be done a honey

278
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:28,559
pot and the sequel server is not ideal
but they fix that son stan and something

279
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,799
that's very interesting and this alludes
to the you know ultimate potential

280
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:38,799
interaction honey pots as somebody is
emailing Marcus

281
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,070
developer maintainer of Daniel and it's
saying look Marcus I found a bunch of

282
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,720
waste fingerprint down here and we
should probably gets them because then

283
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,210
attackers are aware that it's on
something real and then Marcus gives

284
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:01,009
this answer at the end which is very
pessimistic but realistic and he says

285
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:05,139
well this will end in a which on is
there's simply no way to copy a

286
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:10,369
one-to-one behavior of certain stack was
totally aware of the problems of poor

287
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:15,168
now but the sides from these three are
just the tip of the iceberg there is

288
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:22,350
very little I can do about it and
basically is giving us you know if you

289
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:27,559
intend to maintain yrs of the honeypot
projects realizing what honey pots are

290
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,649
good for but the rest of the world was
using any pots are aware of it that is

291
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:38,939
unimpressive record against you know
more trivial waves of attack against the

292
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,419
fence attackers there's no way you can
track them using loaner so for example

293
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:50,820
we try and find out another way of
detecting Daniel Daniel doesn't issue

294
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:58,830
TPS service in a certificate issued his
name has done is website ok so

295
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,220
and different services there are also
other different problems like candy FTP

296
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,500
service you can use two different
passwords for the same user which never

297
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,769
happens in the regular login and other
ones right so what can we learn from

298
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:16,570
Daniels work makes the service
exploitable to known exploits because

299
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,149
then you'll be able to capture the
attackers detector will be successful

300
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:29,539
and now attacker risks losing resources
in a very dramatic where rights and

301
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:36,700
offer a blast off very cool honey pot
which purposes to emulate a website and

302
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,840
be a honeypot web style attacks
specifically if you run it

303
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,269
reconfigurable can actually load in the
whole file system or the website Europe

304
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:52,820
presenting but if you don't do anything
you get this random web page is just as

305
00:27:52,820 --> 00:28:01,470
random great text on it which was weird
and I said ok I guess nobody actually

306
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:08,460
has that random generated web page
everybody considers that well but then I

307
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:15,580
i distrust and as you can see in the
bottom of the page there's just there's

308
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:21,000
this signature is saying this is a
really great entry and just never gets

309
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,730
randomized it's always the same and if
you go and google look up that strength

310
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:32,559
you'll find a lot of websites that have
subdomains with that address senator so

311
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:39,658
trade easy to figure out their stuff
websites and stuff if you will cost of

312
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:45,370
tries and do it is revealed / HTC shadow
PC password for directory traversal

313
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:53,469
attacks and I do it at the style which
are always the same unless I can trigger

314
00:28:53,470 --> 00:29:01,460
it and this leads to a whole cat and
mouse game of trying to fulfill the

315
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,640
entire file system which can be done

316
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:10,560
and also skipping over just because of
time constraints so and there's also

317
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:25,020
another project called sensor which also
escaped and now the four-game ok so the

318
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:52,160
last part I want to show but I will
probably not sure the last part that I

319
00:29:52,160 --> 00:30:00,010
wanted to show as we did using that
diana web certificate issuer we did a

320
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:06,370
scan of the entire internet for one day
one specific day using scans I O

321
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:30,929
boats working OK in the meantime

322
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:53,390
slides will be able to see a global
statistic of all the organizations we

323
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,620
found that whole different honey pots on
the country's everything he does is

324
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:02,649
probably the coolest part of slobodan
its ok

325
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,879
questions ok thanks
