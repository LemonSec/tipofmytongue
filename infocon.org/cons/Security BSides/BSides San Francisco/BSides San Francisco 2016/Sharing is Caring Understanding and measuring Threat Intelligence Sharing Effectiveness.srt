1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,769
and if so how much time do it to you but
my name is Doug spindler am one of the

2
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:18,220
organizers how's the conference going so
far I take the compliment

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:24,099
there's another guy downstairs take the
complaints ok is that fair so I take all

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,590
the glory any questions about the
conference we have to manage well people

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,760
are still walking in anything we could
do better for next year I take that as a

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,669
compliment

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:45,570
holy smoke more space here yet you know
that's easy to fix pay more free beer ok

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:55,570
guard so I got a question let me let me
kinda just throw this out here I i teach

9
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,039
part-time it's a community college San
Francisco CCSF CCSF has a campus

10
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,700
downtown that's about a five eight
minute walk it's in Chinatown at your

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,990
local from the Moscone Center so the
question I have is would you like to

12
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,548
have it there but the tradeoff is we
can't have alcohol

13
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:25,130
the space would be free and we can have
more sessions and more room

14
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:31,969
you cannot bring it in because this is
our education system and we don't want

15
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:37,818
to pollute students with alcohol no no
no no that's a big no no no

16
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:46,140
so what I'm hearing from you is alcohol
is more important than space space well

17
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:57,560
you know this is a tradeoff that we have
to think about so you know you have

18
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:08,209
comedy night maybe ok all right so my my
response is yes there is Thurs I think

19
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,750
hi it or there's some hotels and this is
downtown San Francisco the lots of bars

20
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:19,579
and I'm sure we can get a sponsor and I
believe the restriction is you cannot

21
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:23,870
consume alcohol and premises but that
doesn't mean that you can't have

22
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,760
consumed alcohol off premises and come
on premises in other words we have no

23
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,750
drug testing for students yet

24
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,840
alright so let me introduce I think
we're time right

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,620
ok so Alex Pinto very good so far

26
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:51,200
chief data security scientist of nettle
which is like a needle so I'm sooo

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:03:01,048
making are you trying to find a needle
in a haystack tell you what I would like

28
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:04,049
to see your presentation please take
over

29
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:16,250
hello 11 how we doing this is good I'll
try not to move along

30
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,370
hello ok how about now

31
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,480
ok all right let's get this show on the
road so my name is Alex Pinto

32
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:36,859
assigned to serve needle and like dog
very well presented have also been doing

33
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:44,069
a lot of research and projects right and
this is sharing is caring right and this

34
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:52,170
is in a way that the ending of a like a
maybe a two year two years long story of

35
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,879
research and presentations to have been
doing on the overall quality of the

36
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:59,858
threat intelligence indicators and what
we can do about it to make it a little

37
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:06,269
less sucky and actually be able to use
them for stuff right to some definition

38
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:10,620
of stuff really depends on what your
organs to do so I'm gonna take a guess

39
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,599
through a journey right this is a long
presentation I'll do my best not to over

40
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,570
should my time they think I i think now
that I know that it's long it's gonna be

41
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,180
a little better and please enjoy and if
it's the first time you watch a

42
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:29,270
presentation for me I apologize in
advance and anybody on the twitters

43
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:35,180
right we have a hashtag its DDT I and
that stands for data driven threat

44
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,889
intelligence it's not anything you will
find in urban dictionary or anything

45
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,370
like that this is completely safe for
work doesn't mean it can't be now right

46
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:49,840
you just guys just have to be created
but probably yes so anyway let's get the

47
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,919
show on the road so anyway lets this is
this talk is specifically about threat

48
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,479
intelligence sharing right and it's
really what i've been housing assy

49
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:06,860
wasting but it will be spending my time
analyzing and trying to to find

50
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:10,539
interesting that recent things that
would work right when we're thinking

51
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:13,219
about intelligence sharing because it's
all the rage right that's something

52
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,810
that's very very popular right now but
first I have to take you to a very teeny

53
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,569
tiny journey through what I have said
before more threat intelligence

54
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:25,819
so the new guests can be in the right
context right because like most of my

55
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:30,339
presentations this is a work of spite
right I make a point

56
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,309
the right and then somebody you know
what you're actually wrong because of

57
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:38,089
this is Mike all really ok here's a year
of my life trying to prove that actually

58
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:41,879
you're the one who's wrong sir I mean
like anything on the internet so it's

59
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,949
important to take you through the story
and it's important for you to to to get

60
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:50,610
the context of what I'm trying to
explore in why why should we care why

61
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,839
this is important for all of us so
important point is that this is a data

62
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,629
driven talk right of course there will
be a lot of opinions right but these are

63
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:04,229
opinions that came from data that I
actually gathered from several different

64
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:08,258
ringtones providers several different
drug intelligence sharing platforms and

65
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:12,979
things like that right so the idea is
here and the like most of these things

66
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:19,929
when you actually look at the data you
get your your baby or understand your

67
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:24,349
gut feeling is validated right but it's
always important for us to try to look

68
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:27,628
at the data and the data will help us be
better that they too will help you

69
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:32,759
understand how we can improve in all
those different things anyway what's the

70
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,519
story here what have we done before so
for you or so ago maybe two years now I

71
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:44,959
stuck time gets really funny around
Silicon Valley I was working around

72
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,689
trying to find metric song threat
intelligence indicators so everybody has

73
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:52,889
a threat feed you can buy buy you can
buy you can get a bunch of fresh sheets

74
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:56,219
on the internet how do you find which
ones are good which ones are bad which

75
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:02,169
ones are maybe more attuned to whatever
you need to defend or maybe oh this one

76
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,698
is just replaying that one right so we
actually shouldn't have them both so all

77
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,360
sorts of different things like because I
mean everybody was fighting for or have

78
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,849
them or indicators and everyone it and
nobody really cared because people maybe

79
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:19,740
we're just making up IP addresses I mean
they had distributed systems of honey

80
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:26,039
dark gnats everywhere you know lots of
IP addresses so the point is let's let's

81
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,019
have a look at it let's let's analyze
this ranks up there with their true open

82
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:32,350
source projects that the project would
forward

83
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:36,880
one is called combine which needs a lot
of love it has been like left on the

84
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,340
wayside for a while but I find some I've
actually found someone who's willing to

85
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:46,359
help me save it right over there he's
over here somewhere but anyway it's

86
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,460
really a pattern collection by two
scripts that will get open source

87
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,830
intelligence I mean

88
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,359
intelligence feeds that are open the
final list to find a different website

89
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,500
and put them in a former the CSP you can
put anywhere

90
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,630
tended to creates senator some other
North retinoid integration though

91
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,969
hopefully soon I have my friends car
over there and the back is going to

92
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:14,600
develop it for me I'm sure but anyway
you get defeated if you use Taq test

93
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,180
which was the real star of the show
right which was doing statistical

94
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,000
analysis and all sorts of different
tests to see oh this district judges

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,080
feed updates itself do people clean it
up right all sorts of different

96
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,060
questions you think like you assume that
if you're buying something right

97
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,900
the people would take care of the feeds
but you know what sometimes you just

98
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:41,728
look right so anyway there was a bunch
of tests go through the whole story I

99
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,380
just want you guys to know that there
was an overlap test in the wasn't

100
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,950
uniqueness test and they're actually my
cousins right dat is how much overlap

101
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,340
there are between different intelligence
feeds so when you see a chart like this

102
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,550
right this actually means like the
darker the

103
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,060
the square is actually mean there's
there's more overlap between a feed its

104
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,800
own horizontal in the field it's on the
vertical right and it's not symmetric

105
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,890
because some feeds are bigger than
others so one big feet can contain the

106
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,790
whole of the smaller feet right but that
obviously doesn't work the other way

107
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,069
it's not really a transitive right but
at least with something like this you

108
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,210
can tell how similar or how different
the threat intelligence feeds are and

109
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,340
this is one of the funniest things on my
research right as one of the most

110
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,190
interesting is the conclusion that from
that research shows you guys

111
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,440
which was you know I was expected to be
a lot of overlap and this is

112
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,000
specifically about outbound data right
when I see how is like places that are

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,690
hosting malware or C Chu servers or your
favorite apt prett nation state threat

114
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,580
actor infrastructure at this is places
you go to and they're bad this very

115
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,970
little overlap there's a lot of industry
the flip side there's a lot of

116
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:08,650
uniqueness so maybe 95% of the data from
those providers there was no actual

117
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,770
intersection right and I'm talking about
IP addresses domain names and talking

118
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,180
about I didn't even look at hashes but
if you're looking to hashes this number

119
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:22,479
becomes even worse right and everybody
kind of has two cents as well right and

120
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,980
I was actually surprised when I did this
because I was glad all the beads feeds

121
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,850
they would be pretty much more on the
same ball right there would be tracking

122
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,730
the same actors they would be doing the
same were right I know very talented

123
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,300
people working in all those companies
but now it's like everybody searching

124
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:46,540
for the same things and not finding
enough right and its size 22 a more

125
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,930
interesting statistical conclusion right
and this is what this is what we were

126
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,250
talking about in 2d Birtles shear which
was the fifth her soul in order lap and

127
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,220
it doesn't really matter how many
threats feeds you get in in studio

128
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,870
overlap becomes very small it actually
means the thought probably our surface

129
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,690
right that the number of people that are
actually out to get us is so much more

130
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:15,050
larger than were able to discover right
because if you just like you you get a

131
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,939
sample of the people who are bad let's
say tragedies order samples they are

132
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:26,110
examples of things that have been better
than a fun to be back right and then you

133
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,660
just keep getting more samples a more
simple and is very little overlap admits

134
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,880
that your population is probably very
very very large right and the idea is

135
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,070
that once was a head up there

136
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:46,260
abt end you can forget it I mean I
really want questions please don't

137
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:54,569
forget it so so the point becomes when
he doesn't matter how many feet cigar

138
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,410
doesn't matter how many future bike
that's never a winning strategy there

139
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,819
are diminishing returns

140
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,810
you're never gonna get all the
intelligence you're never gonna know all

141
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:08,380
tibetans right you have to learn from it
you have to look get the data analyzed

142
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,530
the data hunt with the data do all those
things with just the data doesn't do

143
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:17,670
that right I'm not saying don't buy them
i'm saying that just to buy them all and

144
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,479
make sure what's whatever you're buying
is good for you right into the story

145
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,550
about the tests so I ended up with this
conclusion right so guys it's it's not

146
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,599
about how many feet right it's about
what you do with it what's your

147
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,430
intelligence program like how you make
it a reasonable right and go into all

148
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:39,640
those things like a dog by a feed before
you know what your process of it look

149
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:46,840
like just get the free ones for now and
make it work right understand how you

150
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,540
would do something like that before you
actually commit money to it right and I

151
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,569
was super happy because this is a good
conclusion right it's kinda stuff like

152
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,760
you go home and you like yeah I did my
job today this was good research but

153
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,189
then the internet happen right and
they've got a lot of constructive

154
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:09,040
feedback and one of the most interesting
facts I got was that you're absolutely

155
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,510
right about the overlap about uniqueness
but you know that's what threatens to

156
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:20,790
Sharon's gonna is going to solve and I'm
like really I i i cant see that so I

157
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,300
decided okay let me have a look but why
not if I mean knowledgeable people

158
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:32,540
thought leaders are telling me that this
show is going to solve so let's do it I

159
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,530
mean at least I can be a thought
follower right I can you know right so

160
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,810
anyway and I was like what do people
like stretching also sharing what steel

161
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,839
lure right actually it comes to a very
simple

162
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,480
plan of information security platitudes
right so quite number 12 right everybody

163
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,510
has this argument on threat intelligence
that the best threat intelligence is the

164
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,280
one that should bill you generate
yourself right and I called this the

165
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:10,770
artisanal hand-woven indicator theory
right it's like yeah we know this is

166
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,990
really good because this is my neck

167
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:19,930
the knife and a chip this for ages it is
dis is perfect right and I'm not saying

168
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,199
that's wrong adjusting their stash
problems when you think it's like that

169
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,230
right and the second one is that the
kind of the herd mentality and herd

170
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,030
immunity kind of things like air if
everyone from the industry gets together

171
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:37,850
everybody's gonna be protected right ok
we don't talk about that as well and

172
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,490
there's something magical happens in the
middle right after we take care of all

173
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:49,330
of this and then we will secure right so
the first thing that came to mind when I

174
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:55,460
was thinking about the hand-woven stuff
is well I don't know how many of you

175
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,830
guys actually tried to make threat
intelligence operational in your

176
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,610
organization's its heart it's super hard
because of the volume of data it's super

177
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,440
hard because of the volume or threatened
to adjust the volume of lucky to have to

178
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,030
compare it to whatever other magical
thing you're doing your pivot senior

179
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,959
running multi goes who are anyway oo the
oldest hunting funded people do these

180
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,630
days the problem is there's a lot of
articles industry of push back on track

181
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,040
in college because it's just too hard to
use right and there was this article 44

182
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,699
45 one where it was you know what if
only for the one percent if you're like

183
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:36,970
I see community if you're like that just
doesn't make any sense if you're like a

184
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,180
big bank if you have a couple of dozen
people to spare to just attracts hunting

185
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,880
all the time

186
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:49,180
sure it's perfect for you with them if
consumed with it is for the 1% what is

187
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,910
the percentage of people that actually
agree to generate good indicators that

188
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:58,439
other people are going to be able to use
right so it becomes the question right

189
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,690
it's I mean I'm assuming that whoever
generates it has gone through the whole

190
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:07,520
process of actually using them so he
knows what's good for him so it becomes

191
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,829
a problem fundamental problem of who
these people who are sharing and who are

192
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,910
these people going to be right so we go
to the herd immunity thing which

193
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,819
honestly doesn't make any sense because
the whole point about the herd immunity

194
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,760
thing is that you are maybe you were
vaccinated and most of the population is

195
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:35,340
vaccinated let's let's call vaccinated
you got the IOC right but I mean it's

196
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,130
just because my office my bank's office
is like the side the other banks office

197
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,250
doesn't mean that case protected right
because the internet kinda connects us

198
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:50,570
all not through like specific space
constrains right so everybody's watching

199
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,140
everybody and touching each other germs
all the time on the internet so it

200
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,890
doesn't really work like that everybody
would have to have all the IOC's all the

201
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:05,280
time I'm not seen that's impossible
right and that this is definitely the

202
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,410
goal of some people it to be able to
speed up the sharing and make sharing

203
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:14,750
more pervasive right in I'm an honest
believer that this should be the goal

204
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:20,010
I'm just straight to to point out here
that this is actually to do and we're

205
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,020
not even close to figuring out what
those things mean right so it's very

206
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,210
easy to go into platitudes and just
think that oh yeah communities and

207
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:36,400
verticality you know and and get lost in
the details like everything security the

208
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,910
devil is in the details

209
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,059
a hundred percent

210
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:46,059
and the rest of this is not important so
let's let's let's let's let's handle the

211
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:49,940
I have to think about the time so let's
let's let's talk about the the the the

212
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,299
question marks write a few question
marks the real important park because we

213
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:00,399
sharing right in his thing if you if you
look at the way that intelligence

214
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:03,918
sharing communities have been put
together data me they have existed

215
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,639
forever as long as there has been
security there has been changed

216
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:13,840
communities that has been closed made a
list that has been forums right and this

217
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,799
is something that we inherited I mean
everybody does dissolute intelligence

218
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,149
what the threat intelligence even mean
you should be an intelligence analyst we

219
00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:29,340
inherited this from the intelligence
community and the way they're treated

220
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,908
craft or whatever

221
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,700
fancy would you want to use their
actually around you have very close

222
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,659
trust groups that people who know each
other people who can set for each other

223
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:42,460
right and then oh I'm gonna tell you
that this bad things happen right so

224
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,740
then you can act right but I'm doing
this as a trust thing right I know who

225
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,590
are you know who I am right if discuss
everybody's screwed in the same way so

226
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,100
if it does a lot of things they're right
but it in this is the culture that

227
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,709
permeates this to this day the problem
is now we're trying to move to a more

228
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,799
something that's not an eccentric or
something who spits out emission century

229
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,960
right we're trying to push the psychoses
as fast as we can and that's the work

230
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,769
that sticks is trying to do right and I
mean you can see whatever you want from

231
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:18,629
sticks they are trying

232
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:24,309
rights they are trying to put together a
stander so we we stop sending emails and

233
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:29,190
CSV files to each other and that I I i
mean i applaud that that is amazing

234
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,080
someone has to step up and created like
the first version which was terrible now

235
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,470
the second vs gonna come out gonna be a
slightly less terrible and hopefully

236
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,809
we'll get to like okay this is almost
fine but we have to study to rate you

237
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:47,610
have to start doing to us and there's a
lot of and there's a lot of like people

238
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,539
you shouldn't just be sharing IP
addresses in eap addresses to each other

239
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:52,390
or domain

240
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,170
pains or things like that you should be
doing the teepees you should be doing to

241
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:03,820
higher quality things but then these are
the same people who they aren't they

242
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,399
don't have enough analysts to do
anything with that right it's it's it's

243
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,930
almost like a job protection thing I'm
the only one who can understand what's

244
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:16,970
on the mailing list and it's also
becomes it also becomes oh let's just

245
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,310
not to IOC sharing but then sticks is
too complicated I just wanna see the

246
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,790
address so nobody has any clue what they
want

247
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:30,200
right and again as a human as a human
fuels 13 this is perfectly normal is

248
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,320
fine but we just have to be aware of
where we are trying to put your ships

249
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,210
where r trying to understand where we're
trying to move forward as we do this is

250
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:44,250
this whole sharing thing and I get this
is that the trustees that I was talking

251
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:51,230
about and this is also a cornerstone of
the of the thing on one hand we get all

252
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,570
these things

253
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:58,679
the season bill that everybody should be
sure I was seized with the federal

254
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,980
government right everybody should be
sharing sharing is amazing but then it's

255
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,400
all premiered about the circle of trust
mentality right and it's very hard to

256
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,280
reconcile those two things right

257
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,899
these are two completely different ways
to see the world right that somehow have

258
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:20,670
to be reconciled for us to be successful
into this right and one important thing

259
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:26,620
that people do realizable trust is now
is the two-way aspects because not only

260
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,919
I want to be able to send something to a
group and I know that everybody in the

261
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,070
group are people I trust so that they
will consume the data properly they will

262
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,050
take care of it they will not i dont no
leak my source whatever you want to call

263
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,090
it they will not tell the threat that
we're on to them but on the other hand

264
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:53,550
that creates liability right because me
as company whenever I am 01 every

265
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:58,310
sharing those IOC's you know what you
think they got owned by these guys you

266
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,520
know and there's there's a legal
argument there

267
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,420
and one there is significant barriers
well as far as legal as far as being

268
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:12,290
able to put your name into an IOC and
that ties into the whole trust aspect of

269
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,600
it but on the other phone the flip side
of that if everybody just shared

270
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,860
anonymously right if you knew ok Alex
does a kind of a good job when he does

271
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,310
the OC stuff so anything he posed any
time to post something I'll have a look

272
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,120
right but then it's it's just such
coming as anonymous

273
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,590
who's this guy I'm gonna waste my time
analyzing what he put their right and

274
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:40,110
and you know it is it even worth it so
you're always in the danger of the other

275
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:44,729
guys threat intelligence team be three
toddlers on the trench coat you never

276
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,330
know right especially if it's anonymous
right and they're still there is on the

277
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,330
trust aspect there is a repetition thing

278
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,390
so anyway in a family renting this was
this was me this is a literally meal I

279
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,280
hope this doesn't make any sense but I
think about that if you think about this

280
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,120
girl think about that and I'm like ok
let's given this let's try to look into

281
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,020
the sharing communities and see if
there's something we can learn right and

282
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,700
I'm read it again this is all
constructive right this is like maybe if

283
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,580
we understand that we have those
limitations like and limitations are the

284
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,610
most important thing in any engineering
endeavor that you do write you have to

285
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,879
understand where the limits are and then
you can start to measure against those

286
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,710
limits and maybe you can find this is
how far as we can go with this model

287
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,560
right and then you can maybe think of a
different model but if every if you just

288
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,629
like we she hoped that things are going
to be great that we're not helping

289
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:46,540
anyone so let's fight so I got a couple
of friends to play it was you probably

290
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:52,320
heard of Franklin act and you've
probably heard especially here in the

291
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,540
Bay Area probably heard of the work to
see smoke is doing on an exchange it's

292
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:01,550
it's very ATIS so if you don't have a
lot of developers you might struggle a

293
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:07,010
little bits to get started with them but
they're doing good work for sure and

294
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,350
some other folks and want to be
identified that's perfectly fine we love

295
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:16,649
you right but we love these guys most
because you know they they like me

296
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,110
because you know you can talk about us I
know you're not gonna say anything too

297
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:27,060
bad if they only knew but anyway in
special especially Facebook it's funny

298
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:31,639
because everybody was like so outraged
when Facebook started the thread

299
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,000
changing oh my god I'm gonna send my
dealer to facebook facebook is the devil

300
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,800
guys guys sharing communities are social
networks right and maybe this is the

301
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,909
thing that we are not making the link in
our house right the more you understand

302
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,510
that the sharing community and
incentives are sharing communities may

303
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:55,090
be a more aligned with your Facebook
feed and your twitter feed

304
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,750
days things right there may be some
things we can learn from this in order

305
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,720
to make the shopping experience across
the board better

306
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,940
and people get more engaged you want
engagement right and I sound like this

307
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,690
he noted marketing person right now and
I apologize for that but the secret is

308
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,500
people have to use the system the more
people use the system the more people

309
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,169
who use the system it's as simple as
stacked so let's start with the

310
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:29,820
indicators themselves right so some of
these some of these communities I was

311
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,230
actually a part of them so I could look
at the IOC's some of them were like you

312
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:39,289
have to be the starter I don't have to
pay this amount of money today so they

313
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:44,890
just send me like the ones I could see
right I have a look I used those tests

314
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,210
that I should do before so that we can
try to understand try to at least get a

315
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:55,120
taste right an idea of the quality of
the data so amazing actually right and

316
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,260
this is compared against all those open
fields that I was telling you about a

317
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,740
couple of private feet rights death
unfortunately you will have to torture

318
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,679
me for me to tell you who they are in
one of the show does this was not an

319
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:14,120
invitation by the way and one sharing
community of those who write and you see

320
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:20,080
that the actual overlap of the data that
wasn't sharing community against the

321
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,158
private feeds and against the rest of
them was actually pretty low right so if

322
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:30,530
I was a part of the sharing community
regardless if I was if I was having each

323
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:36,210
feature not I was getting value of it
wasn't just getting repeat IOC's or

324
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:41,580
sings that everybody knows about this at
least people who are monitoring whatever

325
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,340
all those open seats and things like
that right which was very much the

326
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,178
experiments on the other on your
presentation right and the uniqueness

327
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:53,419
also I mean it's the flip side it stayed
pretty high

328
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:58,370
92% it reduced dramatically from the
other one to one was like 98 because I

329
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,850
added the private feeds on this approach
to have an impact but I've never seen it

330
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:10,120
go down ninety so I mean like I said
it's not ok communities not a problem is

331
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,559
solved that's not it but as far as if
you're making this

332
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,289
portfolio so to speak effect
intelligence feeds inner trying to

333
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:23,200
figure out how many is enough you know
what to me it looks like if you are in a

334
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,889
good sharing community it's pretty much
as good as a beat feat right it makes

335
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:30,070
absolutely no difference right

336
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:34,678
deep the important thing is that the
sharing communities they do not want you

337
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,769
to use them as a feed they want you to
contribute back that's the whole point

338
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:43,929
of the sharing part right so personally
I think you have to start somewhere

339
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:49,289
right and it's just my seat by Cindy
activity right you can let me move away

340
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:56,119
from the ICD act it's very distracting
by moving away from the activity from 42

341
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:59,860
getting there in being a part of it you
might feel motivated and you might mean

342
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:07,019
able to share as you see other examples
you see other people doing so based on

343
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:12,820
all of that based on the trust issues I
was telling you about and and not my

344
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,139
interest issues the community structure
and I try to put together some metrics

345
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:22,498
the metrics I think would be important
in this until the whole Thu testify when

346
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:25,889
you're trying to think about sharing
communities right so that's activity

347
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:32,428
diversity feedback and trust right so
let's let's see what they look like so

348
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:38,220
the point of the activity metric is is
there anyone in there is this on right

349
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:45,590
are people actually sharing right and
very soon and this was meant to be super

350
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:49,619
simple like how many indicators are
shared per day right and pretty soon you

351
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:57,158
start to see the whole trust scenario
showing up right because when you look

352
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:02,529
at the smaller group the average numbers
of Irish you'll see there being shared

353
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:05,529
every day is at least

354
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:10,399
well in the mean thing it's it's it's
more than half that's more than double

355
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,748
actually but across every single day as
well right I find super interesting the

356
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:20,840
spike on the on the large sharing
community there what this probably means

357
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,408
is that people were sharing this
privately right and then suddenly it

358
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:26,890
became public somebody

359
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:33,840
leaked or it was all the apt twenty
thousand million dropped another dunno I

360
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,540
got everybody's going to publish the US
it because you have you guys ever

361
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,629
realized everybody someone publishes a
report

362
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,960
everyone was like yeah we were tracking
disguise to yeah we were so this is

363
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,850
pretty much what happened there this is
pretty much what happened in a suit with

364
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:55,409
probably became public right and so
there's a huge huge dump data so less

365
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:00,870
the more delays more data timely so
again folks back to the small circle of

366
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:05,370
trust thing we're not worthy it all
right there's this dark rooms where

367
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,550
these things are going on right and you
can see that only activity right now so

368
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:14,550
across the board this is only one
example right but across the board

369
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:20,879
you could you could find a relationship
the smaller the group rights and you see

370
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,970
there was a tighter reach your sharing
44 member or things like that right so

371
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,820
they don't want to lose control

372
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,649
you don't want to lose control who's
watching this right it might be

373
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,570
sensitive it might especially if you're
in the middle of an investigation and I

374
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,350
i do I'm not telling people who are into
mill investigation to share data

375
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,050
there's a lot of very important
considerations with law enforcement and

376
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,250
all those things when you're doing this
but even if you're not even if it's just

377
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:53,940
commodity star for its tough teacher
conf three people are still very they

378
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,220
hold their cards very targeted there's
just right so let's talk about diversity

379
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:05,500
right and this actually talks back to
what I was telling you about around the

380
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:12,610
1% kind of thing right and diversity was
it was very interesting to me because I

381
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:18,439
figured out at least on the sampling of
the author of the communities that I had

382
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,990
and some of them they didn't want to
share the data but they were like they

383
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:26,320
were ok it's like doing an interview in
me talking to them so across the board

384
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,399
it's like 10 percent this matter how
many people you have in your community

385
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,929
only ten percent will share

386
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:40,119
right and several reasons may be there
to read ahead of the pack pride and

387
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:44,869
usually what this boils down to is that
there's actually a couple of people on

388
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:50,379
the team who are very vocal they're very
like oh yeah I know we should be doing

389
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:53,699
this for the betterment of mankind or
something like that and I'm trying to be

390
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,399
non ironic here they really want to
contribute back to really want to help

391
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:02,498
that right and so they helped push Dior
to be in a position where this kind of

392
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:11,039
showing works so it's funny because I
was just talking to people like us to

393
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:18,480
low right should we have more people win
sharing in a had more than once people

394
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,600
tell me you know what if it was more
people because it's probably gonna be

395
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,230
crap it's funny how it's it's it's it's
inside people's heads right that the the

396
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:36,769
scar city is related to quality right
and again this becomes a very little

397
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:43,740
just kind of exercise only the the the
very few have this capability to share

398
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,350
and we we can only share of the sprout
few right who are doing this thing so I

399
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:55,980
mean the show on the left is the actual
numbers like you can see drops like

400
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,220
dramatically so I know if my clothes in
the audience I have not checked if this

401
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:08,850
is a power law so leave me alone right
you use a power law I justice and and

402
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,809
this is the log thing you see it's it's
it's bed right the guy who shares the

403
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:20,759
most is she really shares the most right
so again this is not terrible if you

404
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,639
think back to the whole to the whole
social network thing this is

405
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:29,439
distribution of Twitter followers number
of accounts by number of Twitter

406
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,129
followers right then and there is a
correlation hammacher tweet to how much

407
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:37,509
followers you have right and for some
people it's actually negative

408
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:40,669
correlation because people see our super
damages and follow you

409
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:46,029
but it's usually a positive correlation
right so what you see is the same power

410
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:49,289
lawyers for the things the same
assassination can think some people are

411
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:54,109
more naturally notes there more
naturally connectors do more naturally

412
00:33:54,109 --> 00:34:00,980
talkers right and I know he gets the
more like it right date maybe they think

413
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:06,600
they're helping maybe they think that
they just want the recognition rate so

414
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:14,000
it's normal it's a relatively normal in
fact as a human thing so this is where

415
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,260
it gets dicey I was like ok everybody
sharing but what is the state around

416
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,260
somebody's looking at it right i mean is
that they any good

417
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:34,510
right in the whole thing falls apart it
turns out that almost nine defensively

418
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,950
right now because somebody's gonna
reason we actually do that but almost

419
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:42,819
none of the threat intelligence
platforms actually provide your way to

420
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:49,270
give feedback to whomever post right so
if I go in and I have the best of

421
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:55,309
intentions I'm not maliciously trying to
mess things up and oh my god this age

422
00:34:55,309 --> 00:35:02,619
thought 888 you super evil I have a lot
of machines it's totally it's a DNS

423
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:07,410
extradition points how many machines are
talking with DNS with the right and I

424
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:14,520
both its you know to the sharing
community nobody says a thing it goes

425
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,509
unnoticed by me and I don't know if it's
because people are not consuming it's

426
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:26,920
because already have the future so I
don't care so it becomes very hostile I

427
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:32,390
mean maybe people rush I would like to
know what it is but people don't give

428
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:37,540
feedback and this is one of the biggest
problems we have it specifically when it

429
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,540
when we talk about how we doing

430
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:49,609
I think how we do this the whole bar you
must be this tall to share you must be

431
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:54,480
this tall to be a part of the show
community she really IOC skin be hard

432
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,869
but giving feedback is not heart right I
think everyone who has any sort of

433
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:06,790
monitoring thing which is like more than
oh there's just one security guy and he

434
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:12,009
does that for fun when he doesn't want
to go home right you can look at

435
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:17,090
something like that and just give some
feedback or I think this is wrong or you

436
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:22,740
know what I actually saw this right but
it's still it's the right then again I

437
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:29,100
was looking at so I was I was actively
trying to like what they say oh I was

438
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:34,190
looking with kind eyes and I was like oh
maybe there's an updated time let's

439
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,820
assume if there's an updated timestamp
it's the same in the teacher but then

440
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:43,580
the first first answer it and then last
someone went that'll give feedback so I

441
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:50,730
am counting dots feedback or someone you
have you published yossi and then only

442
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,970
on maybe a couple of days someone
published that so similar see again with

443
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:01,500
a different thing I'm gonna count that
as feedback right because why are you

444
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,840
not there the controls are not there to
defeat vessel maybe people are being

445
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,510
created

446
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:12,820
still only zero dark and even reading
from 2000 13 that's like that's awful

447
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:18,930
that had a sort of feedback otherwise
you have just as indicators they're

448
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:24,180
swimming in their dare like I'm super
cool and you're right I have I'm one of

449
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:32,330
several million we have and nobody knows
if they're good or not right and having

450
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:37,980
this feedback processes would be
radically again increase the trust on

451
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:42,260
the quality of the data on the members
themselves and this is the this is one

452
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,540
of the main things that I think the
ultimate that sharing if we can call it

453
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:52,060
like that hasn't cracked because this is
natural when you go about the end of the

454
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,370
strength Center KWorld

455
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:58,520
because they're talking to each other on
email list so somebody sends just seen

456
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,410
this combined the other one yeah I was
investigating this is what I've been

457
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:08,149
able to extract right and people just
help each other in like this other email

458
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:14,180
from the same campaign and then you as
again as a trained human analysts right

459
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:20,700
and you know good luck hiring those
people you can see the story playing on

460
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,060
and on

461
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:27,049
email you can reason through it you can
put it on whatever system you have tried

462
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:31,570
but we gotta do better than that we got
a defensive than that we can't leave

463
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,320
like reading emails all the time

464
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,940
right so this is an open question right
I'm not claiming that I have the

465
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:43,970
solution here I probably would be my
Yahoo right now if I had to solution but

466
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:47,939
this question that we must ask ourselves
and we must try again

467
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,480
driving this thing forward which again

468
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,170
tyson to the trust metric right which is
a ghetto

469
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:59,020
what we're talking about lecture for
everyone right but what about the people

470
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,700
who would trust right so it turns out
that maybe eighty percent is shared

471
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:09,540
privately right if you look at the
dealer there and I was unable

472
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,850
I didn't see any of the data but it was
like ok tell me how many things are

473
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:19,089
going on on your open community or its
teal white or whatever you want to call

474
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:24,430
it so everybody I just signed up to
destroy the system right what I can IC

475
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:29,509
without knowing anyone and you look at
the amounts that people were almost

476
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:35,730
direct messaging themselves or D create
a steamy tiny private groups where the

477
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:39,500
old just the three of us because we are
like buddies and we drink beer all the

478
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,000
time and we're going to share this
information here it was massive it was

479
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,360
massive but again it was knocked weird
if you think again about the social

480
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:56,200
networking structure right and this
whole lot of you guys use slack if you

481
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,169
owned a channel they send you some
statistics every every week or so right

482
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:05,430
this is how much people have been
talking you should stop slacking off

483
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,740
work because that's what the

484
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:13,009
you should actually do work and stop
like working on the chat room and you

485
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:19,430
see like 76% of whatever was sad and
this is like this maybe a year old place

486
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:25,730
that I I usually spend some time alone
and actually do serious work out 72 76

487
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:30,100
percent was was was that direct
messaging or private groups are things

488
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:36,330
like that may be deemed retirement helps
put these people together right so maybe

489
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:40,610
they used it as a tool in order to share
amongst themselves i mean they used the

490
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:45,920
machinery but again this is not the
pervasive sharing that we think we want

491
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,180
to build on that were claiming that were
building on all those things right so

492
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:56,279
again this is important to understand
what the limitations are right it's

493
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,570
still humans were going to make a
decision if this is going to be sent out

494
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:04,480
or not the good news at least is that
the data quality was a little bit better

495
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:11,070
on a private stuff and I mean I mean
that very flimsy road I'm actually

496
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:15,869
expect exchanging hashes for IP
addresses I'm not sure how familiar you

497
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:21,830
are with david Backes pyramid of pain he
has a whole talk about a host of he

498
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:26,310
talks about hunting about the idea of
the pain is that how much pain you

499
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,710
caused your adversary when you figure
out different parts of their

500
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,520
infrastructure so hashes are worthless
because you just run the Packer again

501
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,770
and it's a completely different thing

502
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:41,660
JP addresses a little bit step up right
because actually you know he had to get

503
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,920
IP address on a bulletproof provider is
gonna have to call the guy and get

504
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,720
another one so it's a little bit so
we're exchanging have chess for IP

505
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,390
addresses which I think it's good which
ties again to the may be higher quality

506
00:41:55,390 --> 00:42:00,259
things are happening on the prospect
channels than what we actually see out

507
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:05,760
there right so anyway don't feel bad
about 80% there's a lot of instances

508
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,940
where you have to do the sharing
privately right but we just have to

509
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,730
realize that this is what we're up
against this is the culture up against

510
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:17,840
its not a culture of sharing with
everyone it's not a culture of

511
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:26,170
let's help the community it's it's a
quarter off we are we're a group here we

512
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:33,860
come to trust each other let's just that
some things on the table right so if the

513
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:39,500
good that is not getting there how can
we reconcile right so anyway

514
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:45,650
final stretch guys here's my take rights
and the things we should be thinking

515
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:51,690
about if we really want to improve this
and really liked make me wrong and make

516
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:56,440
that guy on the internet right the
threat intelligence sharing is like it's

517
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:04,160
gonna solve all of this right so I think
it comes down to two things one is the

518
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:10,529
Trust's right how can you increase trust
how can you make trusts more and again

519
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,400
automatic is a terrible word for it but
how can you make it may be more

520
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:22,870
transitive maybe you know you can make
the actual amount of trust points you

521
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,830
have to have against someone you know
it's it's actually a little bit lower

522
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:30,299
right and also the technical barrier the
technical barriers are real thing right

523
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:35,410
so these are the two main things are
keeping people from sharing right I

524
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:38,950
added don't know how to generate
something to share or my legal gonna

525
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:45,750
kill me if I put it there so when you
think about the trust thing right I

526
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:50,440
think there is there are interesting
experiments to be done with unanimity in

527
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,850
reputation right and again if you if I
sent his face submit something

528
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:02,250
anonymously you're never gonna trust
who's this guy how did why should I get

529
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:07,740
this IP address it's probably doesn't
know what he's doing right but then if

530
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:13,370
whatever community there's a reputation
system on right I don't know who this

531
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:18,140
guy is but everyone here has been
looking what he has been doing and so

532
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:23,870
far he hasn't really fucked up so maybe
we should give him to you know should

533
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,069
give me the extend the benefit of the
doubt right maybe I should start

534
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,319
adjusting to his days

535
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:36,349
and so reputation systems of anonymity
is so it's kind of an understood the

536
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:43,019
animal right I think Stack Overflow does
an amazing job right i mean the actual

537
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:46,649
the people who are mother is there the
usual they're usually good in curating

538
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,440
the goods the good stuff in the bad
stuff right I think I feed read it and

539
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:59,259
how can use on our streets s pools of
humanity but but but as far as their

540
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:04,190
reputation system they're pretty good on
just letting get through whatever

541
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:10,259
twisted things they believe is reality
so it's working right this is not about

542
00:45:10,259 --> 00:45:15,809
an object of truth if I agree with them
or not it's working the model is working

543
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:22,099
they only see what they want to see
right so maybe right we can take this

544
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:26,430
idea this is an idea that we can play
with right as we're trying to put

545
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:32,779
together the these anonymous sharing can
we need to show it involved got the memo

546
00:45:32,779 --> 00:45:37,739
right I'm not sure how much how familiar
guys are we've ot acts it's a system

547
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:43,430
that they they released a few months ago
I i again time is super we're here this

548
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:51,979
place and actually so I signed up as
needle right and this could be anyone

549
00:45:51,979 --> 00:45:56,169
there was no like oh confirm your email
here so that's really use anyone could

550
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,910
have come in and claimed it was needed
it was me or anything like that there's

551
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:05,170
no real tight control right but then I
started posting things that makes sense

552
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:09,400
people started to applaud me people
started to follow me

553
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,839
people started to subscribe to the
things I was posting right and this

554
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:20,328
became a measure of my reputation of
this accounts reputation into the system

555
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:26,630
so everyone else in now when someone own
boards and get it and is like this if

556
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:31,410
you act right this is like engagement
stuff when people on board when they get

557
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:35,499
into CEO of the top five contributors
may be these are the people you want to

558
00:46:35,499 --> 00:46:36,348
follow

559
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:39,539
maybe maybe what they're sharing is good
for you maybe what their sherry's the

560
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:40,609
stuff you looking for

561
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:42,279
start with the east right

562
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:50,590
it can work right and there's a whole
flip side of that which is the curation

563
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:56,580
argument in this is much much more
common on our environment as we're at

564
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,509
right now which is 20 I actually have a
centralized creation system so I am the

565
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:07,690
owner of a threat intelligence community
of some sort and I will do the curation

566
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:12,450
as the owner of that and I mean you
gotta be able to justify some

567
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:16,259
value-added right it's just a fucking
CRM on the internet so you might as well

568
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:24,560
do some curation right so there's some
interesting experiments on that right

569
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,940
specifically like the way to SSI sector
right which they actually have an

570
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:34,690
anonymous tip box anyone can send an
email there and say this is happening

571
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:40,250
right and within reason right I assume
that it's not super used in its kinda

572
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:44,570
limited to whomever is a member they
don't know who the members but the

573
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:50,360
independently validate whatever the OC
was good or bad deformations get her

574
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:56,570
back and then they posted to the
community like this was an anonymous

575
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:02,810
submission our team at FSI sack did the
vaccine in this is good info sodium

576
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:09,040
forgot to everyone who needed right and
whomever it happened to that wanted to

577
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,560
become anonymous stay that way not even
if sa sak knows who they are where they

578
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,549
can probably figure out if you didn't do
the cleansing of the horizon I mean

579
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:19,980
there's all sorts of details I mean if
you want to do this please don't fuck it

580
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:25,750
up but it works there are examples of
these things working right but this is

581
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:31,780
very human intensive his right so if you
pay good money for a sock for them to do

582
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:40,770
this for you right so anyway just
wrapping up I think there is there's an

583
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:46,330
argument here for the technical barrier
rights I completely understand that not

584
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:53,770
everyone will be able to produce share
IOC's but feedback is super important

585
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:59,940
and it's easier if you have a shoestring
monitoring team you can give feedback

586
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:05,860
and it can even leaving nasty note 30
minutes of my endless time of this crap

587
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:10,960
you can try to be more constructive of
course but especially when you're driven

588
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,620
by that anger because someone actually
with you are your analyst I'm just not

589
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:22,200
tell the community like this is a false
positive so maybe other analysts time

590
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,410
isn't isn't what is right this is not
this is not hard I mean maybe the tools

591
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:31,540
are not the area people haven't actually
provided a good UX for you to do it

592
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:38,590
right he actually between me put into
stock together and today they actually

593
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:45,530
have an interesting week Pedialyte thing
now which is if you see someone posted

594
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:50,440
something you can actually suggest an
addict and you can add IOC's it can

595
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,890
remove a season can add another comment
and it goes to the original post her and

596
00:49:54,890 --> 00:50:00,109
original poster reviews and approves it
or not that smart way to give feedback

597
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:06,780
you're continuing the conversation
you're being engaged so it's finally one

598
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,440
thing that is kind it's not really
talked about and I appreciate it super

599
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:17,830
hard to do this right is telemetry
everybody's only internet sadly right

600
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:22,970
doesn't matter who you are it doesn't
matter how good your monitoring team is

601
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:27,000
it doesn't matter the your understanding
of threat intelligence or not you want

602
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,420
the internet you have a footprint you
have telemetry right and sometimes the

603
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:38,110
question that people want to answer in
threats and still is a simple asked is

604
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:43,900
this targeted only for me or other
people seen this as well right

605
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:49,850
techniques a huge difference in how much
resources are going to put in right and

606
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,240
how much freaked out you're going to be
because the Panthers are coming out for

607
00:50:53,240 --> 00:51:01,959
you or something so telemetry I believe
is really for us to really unlocking the

608
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,220
potential of a threat intelligence

609
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:12,549
right so needle is not a threat
themselves sharing community but these

610
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:17,780
pyramid these are the tenants of the
kinds of data that we used in our

611
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:24,040
autonomous hunting platform right and
all of them contribute a little bit for

612
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,300
us to be able to pay mister you know all
the stadium gave me this is probably the

613
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,849
story that you're looking for is a
problem reaching important things right

614
00:51:31,849 --> 00:51:36,310
and is it again this is exactly what the
analysts would be doing he would try to

615
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:40,509
figure out understanding of TOC is good
or bad is going to be carried to the

616
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:44,430
telemetry see if it's it's relevant or
not right I really think I'm not really

617
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:50,200
sure how this delimiter sharing works
everybody's gonna freak oh but I heard

618
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:57,279
of g-o-d from sands this is exactly what
I mean it's just involve Farah logs I

619
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:04,349
mean you can't it's it's it's it's a
norse by any other name right but I'm

620
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:06,200
not dissing the day and I'm not dissing

621
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:12,230
sounds for sure ready doing amazing work
but this is still good people use those

622
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:16,820
lists the understand that ok this is I'm
not sure how representative the sample

623
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:21,400
is it's probably a lot of the USS folks
but at least I know what's going on in

624
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,980
the usmore last 36 you know if I'm the
only one being scanned by the sky it's

625
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:33,680
super helpful anyway sherri is hard but
that doesn't mean you should be

626
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,330
discouraged right you should you should
care you should you should try to share

627
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:42,560
but the main reason why we're failing my
take is because we're just trying to

628
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,690
lift a human-centric

629
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:53,130
activity and just so let's just do the
computer system that will handle down

630
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:58,019
and that's it we're done to system and I
can just walk away now there is a lot of

631
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:03,448
translation that we haven't figured out
what does it mean to have the guarantees

632
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:07,849
to have the trust to have the property
that I have in the human centric

633
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:13,569
environments in a way we can share
faster right we need to share festered

634
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:19,119
we need more and more and I'm not gonna
go into this whole sky is falling down

635
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,319
some hour but you guys know it's all
true right you are you living in the

636
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:28,930
trenches you know it's all true right
and having to stand it surely would make

637
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:33,069
000 jobs @ teeny tiny easier if we're
able to do that if we know how to use

638
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:43,819
today right so don't buy feeds just
joined a threat but use it as you use it

639
00:53:43,819 --> 00:53:47,779
as collateral I mean think about it
right this might be the best thing for

640
00:53:47,779 --> 00:53:52,839
you especially the industry focused ones
right they're not about two feet at all

641
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:57,029
they are about the deal will give you
IOC's they will give you indicators to

642
00:53:57,029 --> 00:54:03,819
work with but they will teach you they
will the community will hold fully

643
00:54:03,819 --> 00:54:07,959
support you love it so people who have
gone through the same challenges and

644
00:54:07,959 --> 00:54:16,249
this has very little to do with the
actual I was seated and anyway it's all

645
00:54:16,249 --> 00:54:21,029
terrible it's all more data and we still
need to work through it so I mean just

646
00:54:21,029 --> 00:54:24,880
wrapping up right I love the show

647
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:30,490
so if you're a part of a sharing
community or oh I have threatened

648
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:34,870
charges fees and all those I'm always
trying to collaborate with falls in and

649
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:39,690
do these analyses with understand maybe
helping them I mean it if they if they

650
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,000
feed their so they think there's some
deficiency of the field help them get

651
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,060
better we can all discuss I mean I love
the model we have available the better

652
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:51,950
job we're all gonna do so all four we
having more and more quality of data

653
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:57,220
right and that's why I guess we open for
questions

654
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:31,520
question was when I was showing what
they consider to be threats that

655
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:37,040
specific IP addresses and domain name
domain names IOC's

656
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:41,700
so that was the dinner was extracted
from their fields and I was comparing

657
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:46,899
against each other so if an IP address
only showed once it means there were no

658
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,900
overlap it should twice though was

659
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:07,910
so the question was if there's any
process to agree what in one a threat is

660
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:21,509
so I invite you to go to a threat
intelligence panel and ask them so to

661
00:56:21,509 --> 00:56:27,140
you what is intelligence right because
you're gonna get from a panel for people

662
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:30,749
gonna get five different answers no
there's absolutely no standard everybody

663
00:56:30,749 --> 00:56:36,308
will call anything whatever the whatever
the whatever they want searchlight what

664
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:39,369
is intelligence whatever you want to buy
mister customer that's pretty much the

665
00:56:39,369 --> 00:56:45,009
answer you get across the board so no
there is no commonly defined and again a

666
00:56:45,009 --> 00:56:50,089
lot of people will ok so let's try to
take this away a different way a little

667
00:56:50,089 --> 00:56:58,729
bit last skeptical there is a people
usually defined threat intelligence and

668
00:56:58,729 --> 00:57:03,808
tactical operational and strategic oil
right so the technical stuff we usually

669
00:57:03,809 --> 00:57:07,309
be so there's actually a friend of mine
who breaks down to tactical into

670
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:13,660
technological and just trying to like do
the whole oh this is all the IOC's

671
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,690
moving back and forth automatically
since I don't believe that this is a

672
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:23,229
reality for real I I like to attack type
just just a tactical in the tactical is

673
00:57:23,229 --> 00:57:28,578
this thing that you will put on your
ideas who you actually have something

674
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:35,630
tactical to do it operational is more
like oh I know that vendors like snow so

675
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:40,449
I gotta make sure to have a lot of like
snow melting equipment in my office

676
00:57:40,449 --> 00:57:47,140
because their techniques involves no and
things like that right and so it helps

677
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:53,219
you think on their overall strategies
and how they can talk and strategical

678
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:58,319
one oh my god what am building right now
my company is like super valuable for

679
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:03,719
country acts totally gonna try to go for
me I'm not exactly sure which one of

680
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:07,680
their actors is going to come from me
but someone will have to be prepared for

681
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,129
that

682
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:15,470
answered but this is like yeah I'm sorry
I'm not the one who's going to solve

683
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:21,180
that problem but some people try to
think it's like this right and and of

684
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:26,520
course whatever they sell is the best
one right so that data can tell you for

685
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:30,910
sure ok we're done we're done thanks a
lot guys
