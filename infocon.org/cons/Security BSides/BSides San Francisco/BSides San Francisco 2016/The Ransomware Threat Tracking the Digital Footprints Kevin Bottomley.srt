1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,620
ya self so added the 2002 students go
there we got one and he got a job

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,980
working for OpenDNS so let me turn this
over to you cuz I'm curious to see what

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,540
you got

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,980
when did you graduate how far back do
you hear me OK

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,500
last year and OpenDNS hired you right
away and then you make your hundred and

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:43,149
fifty 200,000 I was actually hired a
great talk to them so like doug said my

7
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,739
name is Kevin bottom I am one of the
security analyst at OpenDNS I apologize

8
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:54,620
for the spotlight behind my kids have to
bear with me I'll put it up

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,899
SlideShare something immediately
following the talk show you my Twitter

10
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:11,520
handle is you can't see it it's ka 3 the
lowest score be 0 UT so that our trip

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,240
there you could find it so it had
actually dug ruin this entire slide me

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:26,419
so I graduated from City College in 2014
with a computer networking and

13
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,170
information security I'm currently a
security analyst with OpenDNS along with

14
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,310
half of the crowd it looks like

15
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:40,930
and then I've spoken I spoke at bsides
last year besides la NASA insecurity

16
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:47,649
week and besides NYC earlier this year a
little bit about what we're going to go

17
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,590
over some of the common prominent
variants that we've seen in the

18
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:59,220
department of the victims of compromise
CT setup and design and kinda how we

19
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,869
went about checking these in stopping
them really quickly so this kind of

20
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:12,790
below historical thing this year classic
FBI lock screen kind of circa 2002 2012

21
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,069
very similar though 2011 mainly
delivered by the family church and

22
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:23,859
family is basically lock screen that you
would see who had sometimes it would tap

23
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,010
into your webcam give you IP address

24
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,010
tell you that you're doing something
illegal

25
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,340
super easy to get around you this boot
into safe mode and use anything like

26
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,310
Malwarebytes have something to remove
the registry key in and this get rid of

27
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,750
it not really anything too crazy but as
time went on we started to see this guy

28
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,420
who kind of came on the scene pretty
past crypto locker think we all know who

29
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,890
that is basically it was like the first
ransomware to really come out and start

30
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,700
attacking like you attach the network
storage devices beyond just the the main

31
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,190
in points using they get 2048 bit
encrypted

32
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:09,319
processing scheme up and it's awesome
every single crypto and fiction nowadays

33
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:20,410
it's called so late 2013 on September
mainly through the game overseas botnet

34
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:26,329
think about that was it was mainly using
domain generated algorithm so

35
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,790
it would produce thousands of these
domains at once and only actually

36
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,350
register one of them is the c2 mainly to
get people like researchers and analysts

37
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,620
the pain in the ass time to try and and
knocking offline and then it's kinda

38
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,620
hard to see this day the comment

39
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,500
wanted to make it look like it's like a
bunch of random characters slam together

40
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,090
making a domain and of course the bad
are you here that's kinda hard to see on

41
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,090
stream pretty much says its bad anyway

42
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:04,390
around mid 2014 we saw the takedown in
the game of his botnet basically took a

43
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,690
locker with it but right around the same
time we started to see a bunch of new

44
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:16,390
variants emerged starting with a torrent
locker which we mainly saw in Australia

45
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,219
and New Zealand and some parts of
European areas was mainly seen in the

46
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,520
form of a fish that looked like either
you've got a red light ticket and they

47
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,109
have some name

48
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,450
red-light tickets down and Australia
that I don't know the name of it but

49
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:35,750
it's not like tickets and more like a
fake tax notice and the screen usually

50
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,540
get redirected to the page you kind of
look like Catholic like this where take

51
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,419
an official state of revenue tax notice
that capture the you have to go through

52
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,430
to make sure that some automated process
and most of the naming conventions for

53
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,240
the torrent locker at least at the time
when we were really looking into it all

54
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:02,960
kinda had like New South Wales / poster
guy and then whatever tod at the end of

55
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,479
it and they basically set out at a ton
of do means that look like this data

56
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,370
base W you know I dot org

57
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,520
some type of like one often look
legitimate but according to use the

58
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,060
exact same naming schema every single
time so we had to do was kind of go

59
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,979
through and bought every single tod that
had that naming schema behind it and it

60
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:28,150
knocked offline pretty pretty easy

61
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,669
one of the other one who started to see
our trip to test its basically the exact

62
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:39,960
same thing this revision it kind of
started out attack video game extensions

63
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,960
so going after game is basically what
they can do it over and studied using

64
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:53,150
like da base domains once again so hard
to see a bunch of letters slammed

65
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,039
letters and numbers land together to
make a domain and then they would

66
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,220
register like when it's a matter of the
thousands they were produced so any type

67
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,760
of lexical analysis on the debate should
have been able to spot this in your

68
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,650
network early easily if you doing any
you know looking into that type of stuff

69
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:13,719
which hopefully you are they can't
change this up in the later versions to

70
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,800
make it harder using compromise domains
much like all the other and we're very

71
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:32,440
interested to do think about the first
round trip was a symmetric key which is

72
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,020
really bad on their part but the talus
groups even to release was called test

73
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,340
which is basically you could like take a
file dropped into the test decrypt

74
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,460
script and it would be able to like
reverse engineer the key backers and the

75
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,080
secret unlock all your files and of
course the nefarious activities read the

76
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:58,450
blog about how to decrypt all the stocks
they win they fix in the 2.0 version so

77
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:07,760
now it's taken into this is kind of a
lot of this talk centered around came

78
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,800
out swinging there at the end of 2014 so
instead of like using all the normal PJs

79
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,070
and everything else is a compilation of
my servers started actually instead of

80
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:24,340
exporting stop itself we would see it
used to be any connects break it and

81
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,299
then at the binary you know that stuff
so they kind of changed up her gently

82
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:35,749
infected stop and then we also saw the
implementation of like tour and ITP

83
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:42,900
being used the kind of cover the proxy
tracks which I don't wanna get a battle

84
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:50,258
report to counter what you see is kind
of shows up at least your comment

85
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,389
compromise kinda happened either through
the use of official and exploit kit to

86
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:57,819
fix on the fish and follow the links
they land on a page it's been

87
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:02,569
compromised with the jacket coat it
seemed like malicious ads that exploit

88
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:07,990
kit happens and then the next procedure
that happens is a call out to a grow

89
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,750
light

90
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:14,699
location IP address return which
basically this goes hey where am I in

91
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,930
the in the domain goes your when dot to
dot the up for whatever and then after

92
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:26,759
he goes away it's a request sent to any
one of numerous compromised web service

93
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:33,070
that act as a proxy between the tour si
toos so they basically the spires off

94
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,370
rapidly like the main one due to the
list and a half hard coded basically

95
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:44,029
into it to send the key and do all the
key exchange with the main hidden c2

96
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:54,529
services and an example might senior
logs actually if you would happen to

97
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:58,750
notice one of these rental inspections
would be you would see this stop him in

98
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,010
here which is actually like the English
exploit kit and then pretty much

99
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:07,189
immediately right after that you see
this caller IP address which is the raw

100
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:13,920
he returned to me and there's a there's
a lot of these domains and then

101
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,870
immediately after that all these next
four domains are all compromise proxies

102
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:28,390
for that for the CT set up so it's it's
easy to see that good times it's super

103
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,140
rapid fire and then back to the main
thing that we're looking for here is

104
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,709
this guy so whatever reason to they put
the same here there's actually a few of

105
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:38,199
them

106
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,500
one of its state geolocation so
basically to figure out where the

107
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:51,240
compromise as one of the reasons they do
this is there's a set of countries that

108
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,840
it doesn't react in melee Eastern
European I ran or any of your apt common

109
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,780
countries you hear about it won't
activate any of those countries you know

110
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:10,380
Ukraine Russia China whatever so they
would also like it might change the code

111
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,080
as well so depending on what the
original exploit kit was doing like you

112
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,800
might like anger events that might give
you might beat up instead in this season

113
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,670
click fraud stuff so one of the other
things that we do

114
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,240
originally was returned the grandstand
where message in the native language of

115
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,490
the country the UN so you were in
america had the message should be

116
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,630
english if you in Spain and Spanish
French except so it's really nice

117
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,280
feature that the authors hit kind of
built into the system really nice keep

118
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,980
this going to be really hard to see
Harry so the other thing that is used

119
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:55,020
for is a unique identifier so when they
request goes out this is a strange and

120
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,360
it's basically he made a request I T

121
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:08,040
campaign idea in Philly and I T MDN 5
the system for the computer OS

122
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,670
information and then at the very end of
the IP address so they can kind of do

123
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,240
this for another couple reasons one is
only allow one infection PA system and

124
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,750
then it also makes it so people like
researchers and analysts have a harder

125
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,700
time seeing exactly what's going on but
at the same time it's kind of a gold

126
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,780
mine because we can do is you can use
like open source tools I dot com

127
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,030
actually anyone from shadows server or
malware ok so

128
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:56,610
basically give me the address and it
will you know return results show you

129
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,440
one of the bad things about me now
whereas it doesn't have a usable

130
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:07,600
eighty-eight you can use I actually do
stuff quickly so what we had done was

131
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,700
good are in turn on this project and
making our own API to now we're so he

132
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,410
could create do you like a bunch of
search summit stuff really really fast

133
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:24,660
which tried breaks tosses something but
whatever so what you get back at you do

134
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,089
this series is a bunch of file hashes
that have all been submitted to malware

135
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:37,700
that have that one artifact in a ride he
call out so here we have the you know I

136
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,970
searched term or whatever and then you
get all your eighty years old still

137
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,530
basically taken to virustotal and you
could see that it's kinda hard to see

138
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,300
but if you look at the file names they
also really super close a pretty much

139
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,290
obviously the exact same thing but they
all have a different indy five and and

140
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,930
the scores from virustotal all different
so you don't really get the most

141
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,130
consistent results back from the EB
engines like that simply going to be

142
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,290
looking to stake like one of the random
hashes this is kind of sniffed out in

143
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,530
the pages is a lot of information but in
the artifacts here in the domains we

144
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:15,390
have our IP address for a call out and
then right after that we have a bunch of

145
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:20,080
other hardcoded demeans into which all
basically signalling to us

146
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:28,010
proxies for the ransomware by now so I
did this for a long time about a month

147
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:33,740
manually going through like every hour
taking that in and searching to find

148
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:40,630
brand new domains obviously it's not
really efficient especially in a big

149
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,630
scale situation so what we started to do

150
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:55,840
my flight isn't there so using various
total and then there's also another

151
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,450
thing and I have no idea why this thing
is in there but there's also very stolen

152
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,670
vehicle intelligence if you're lucky
enough to have IRA Stoll intelligence

153
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,969
give you the back in with a really
awesome API that allows you to do a lot

154
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,970
it really so terrible stuff one of the
things that allows you to do is use your

155
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:21,460
rules to basically anything you want so
what we decided to do was set up a bunch

156
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:27,380
of her roles in virustotal basically
looking for these r I P call out so in

157
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,700
here this morning the IP address chrome
IIP my external IP and IP info all four

158
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,390
of these are used by various ranch
families to figure out whether acts but

159
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:46,199
there were a lot of him things that turn
locker use my external light which is a

160
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,970
really noisy legitimate service things I
can video on Google and Facebook and

161
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,880
everything else you so if you're really
trying to this fine that you get a like

162
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,970
a bunch of excess white noise and it's
really hard to figure out where the bad

163
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:07,750
stuff is but luckily the various actors
use IP address which almost no one uses

164
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,980
so mixing stick out of it more as we see
here in a minute this kind of example of

165
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,730
what you get back if you have those you
are all set up so despite knowing what

166
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,360
rule head we can tell that the first
ones out for a test live cattle Walker

167
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,730
to all tests like the wall street easy
to identify you know put attribution to

168
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:34,260
see the sample sale we take this one we
can take a quick look and it's kind of

169
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,890
the same power had this your domain call
and then some more malicious domains

170
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,100
that are kinda hard to see but there

171
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:51,139
so basically we like this works really
well but it and we're relying on other

172
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:59,449
people to submit the sample so obviously
won't be bigger and a couple of things

173
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:02,979
we look at a special OpenDNS it to
things like when I'm called a coworker

174
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,779
and the other one is related to make the
sub PO points here basically a current

175
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,529
rats basically an endpoint request more
domains and a short time and by a short

176
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:16,589
time we're talking like milliseconds to
like if you land on Google now that

177
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:21,730
analytics stuff that happens the exact
same time is basically a back and then

178
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,720
you have related to meet with a second
look a bit more of a delay in the cause

179
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,670
it's more like a one on one type of
thing so what we did it was looking at

180
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:39,990
this is internal picture from our
investigate to all that we have as you

181
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,329
can see kind of down here there's a
coworker and the down over here there's

182
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:50,109
a related to mean section so this is
kind of a gold mine of treasure trove

183
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:59,220
here we can use IP address of it and
then that thanks to basically giving in

184
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:05,299
here you can see my key in my external
IP so that means that basically in a

185
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:12,900
sample it had IP address Mikes 2.com
Cromitie whatever isn't as backups in

186
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,220
case you couldn't reach IP address and
should be back up a second we originally

187
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,030
they might proceed with a child to block
all of these your IP called to see if it

188
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,168
actually stop the infection and I
discovered that it doesn't so it was a

189
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:32,049
valiant effort on my part but once we
should basically what we started to do

190
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,430
is look at like what was going on here

191
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,820
and you know as you can see there's a
legitimate demands is like Microsoft

192
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:46,320
Points Microsoft and Google Microsoft
yes additional some noise you can't just

193
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,210
like block every domain they happened to
be related to that domain but aside from

194
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,770
these circle things every single other
one of these domains is actually one of

195
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:03,500
the crypto all proxies said maybe one
that I mess but you could put out all

196
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,400
this noise you can basically say ok you
back so basically what we did was to set

197
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,960
up a script to run the check against
what was newly seen against IP address

198
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,630
you know every X amount of time they
said the script and it's like having see

199
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,260
if I seen you you know you have a
decision move on if I haven't seen you

200
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:29,100
send out a notification and one of the
analyst to kind of take a bigger more

201
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,530
deep dive look into it and then when the
analyst if it was bad and not just the

202
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:41,290
kind of help knock out the positives and
then we would update the training set to

203
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:46,290
eventually and then the cycle would you
know if he'd have X amount of time but

204
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,560
eventually what it allowed us to do is
build up to Cheney said that every time

205
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,290
a new demean was seen a related to IP
address that they didn't quite hit the

206
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,490
score we could block and basically
real-time so as soon as you know the

207
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:02,210
berry first instance that we would see
anything related to that minutes later

208
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:07,510
we could send it off pocket it would
never be an issue which is pretty

209
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:15,820
awesome so kind of this is hard to see
but it basically these kind of relate to

210
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,480
a couple of the domains that we had
visited earn a previous slide and these

211
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,070
traffic these bumps in the spikes have
basically like when traffic starts to

212
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:31,480
pick up so I could you look kinda happy
over here there's like no one ever going

213
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,930
to these websites and then I'll send
they start taking off and all of these

214
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,410
single spikes are hundreds of requests

215
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,490
you know tens to hundreds of whatever
requests by infected clients who've been

216
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,400
exploit it and then that

217
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,790
request to call the seat which can no
longer get through because we actually

218
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:56,790
caught his stuff you know where you go
when they're at the beginning before

219
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:07,360
this happened yet so it's pretty pretty
quick response that so basically using

220
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,790
this method we were able to identify
similar in their own lives like two

221
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:17,800
thousand nine hundred and five different
various lockerbie domains some of the

222
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:24,370
other findings it we had also come
across to her it would surface so like

223
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:30,429
we saw things like engler neutrino
Andrea which is a site take away that we

224
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:37,300
didn't actually expect but was pretty
cool and dry wondering some of the ways

225
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:45,780
to prevent stuff so pretty much the
number one way back ups a lot he

226
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,790
wouldn't do this often or well enough
but he basically wanted you back

227
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:56,320
disconnected from the network you today
the ransomware mapping tell you attached

228
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,070
storage and everything and then I'm all
about a block and no script that kind of

229
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,990
helps against your mouth but I senior
year

230
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:13,090
injected codes so so and you should
change and uses against fishing fishing

231
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,850
fishing and more because it happens a
lot especially with the invoice and

232
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:24,830
resume attachments and my recommendation
is you never paid a ransom for some

233
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,040
people might say that it's cheap

234
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,040
to pay the ransom backups

235
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:37,370
choice and then this kind of hard to see
map is kind of a deer distribution in

236
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:45,370
the 2900 buy domains it there we saw so
you can see the pretty much all over the

237
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,860
place except Africa I have the Internet

238
00:21:49,840 --> 00:22:03,230
questions sorry dear distribution is
basically the second map of all 2905

239
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:34,850
compromised websites that yes we're back
to you so finding out with a post it so

240
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:56,639
they have to they have to be able to
export everything they get all the

241
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,440
commands so they know what system is
calling because if they don't stand that

242
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,280
out first then they won't be able to
decrypt the computer which if they can't

243
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,560
decrypt the systems and no one's ever
gonna pay the ransom because no one will

244
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,560
ever be able to get this stuff back so

245
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:46,889
the video I can't speak for them might
get out of that question

246
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:16,018
program probably something I have been
able to talk to him and ask him that far

247
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:18,669
into it yet

248
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:44,259
yeah you know i mean you know they may
be out on that and that's okay I'm

249
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:55,690
looking at the guy from Belarus behind
you because of that camera over there

250
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:02,279
the people who watch stuff but allowing
the lucky stuff is Rd GA based currently

251
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:08,700
so there are actually a lot of these DGA
stop talkin to my seat so when do you

252
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,859
ever see you get to see this mass block
all of the domains out ahead of time

253
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:20,970
which is something it's kind of going on
with lockheed right now that can answer

254
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,169
your question without answering the
question of those people there

255
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:35,650
yeah i text so the Droid X campaign guys
that I saw

256
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:33,850
talk today to the main CT use then you
won't make the CDs won't be able to get

257
00:26:33,850 --> 00:27:05,439
the 60 at all I think this talk with you
about some ideas

258
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,399
yeah
