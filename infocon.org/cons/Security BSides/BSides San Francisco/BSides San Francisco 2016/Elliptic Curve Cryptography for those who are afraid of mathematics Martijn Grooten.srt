1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,420
everybody going down to the last talks
the day I am super excited we are not

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,529
maybe you want this to go on there all
week instead of doing I say you just do

3
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:24,300
besides once again just want to thank
our sponsors without them this would not

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,680
be possible if you have any feedback
about the conference is going to be

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,190
sized accomplished feedback if you have
any statistics in accession back on the

6
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,839
schedule

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,430
figures you there is a big seller
feedback survey button click and provide

8
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,590
feedback we have one more rational going
on at the end of the day

9
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,280
$100 Amazon gift card if you just got
there so go out there and put your name

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,899
in the box if you want to and will
reflect often the day we also done with

11
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:01,760
every paycheck advance so we have a few
extra t-shirt so its first come first

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,959
serve so if you're interested in

13
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:13,869
volunteers to your t-shirt feel free to
go and check in and grab one now we have

14
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:19,280
more time cruising Virus Bulletin he's
going to be presenting elliptic curve

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,780
cryptography for those who are afraid of
map but give me a warm welcome a plus

16
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,780
too much

17
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:41,960
when he went to study mathematics and
after that I worked some yes as a

18
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,149
mathematician

19
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,750
doing research in an area called algebra
and geometry which includes the curves

20
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,070
life doesn't always go the way you
planet and for some reason randomly 10

21
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,589
years ago myself working for a security
company and then I discovered that these

22
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,680
are the current that I liked so much
they play an important role in so

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:13,390
combining my two backgrounds and vocal
and explain how it works but the leading

24
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,899
out all the boring

25
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:24,630
disclaimer first trip that was hot and
mathematics to more than it hurts you

26
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,579
can't get in 25 minutes you're not gonna
learn anything that you can apply

27
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:37,750
tonight tomorrow and the next day sorry
about that I also have a clear I think I

28
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,790
understand it well enough to explain it
but i dont wouldn't call myself a

29
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:50,109
girlfriend and finally to to make to
help explain it to help to make sure I

30
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,750
don't stumble across a small details I'm
cutting a few quarters here now

31
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,810
apologized today announced in the room
ok every introduction to the current

32
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,900
stocks with this formula wisecrack
Eagles XQ beside them tax plus be and

33
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,190
that's prime number be because encrypted
are always prime numbers and I think

34
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,209
this is helpful because he doesn't
really matter so please don't reply to

35
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,250
remember this formula but do remember
that has some choices to make a

36
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:26,400
difference a different beat the curves
and some are more suitable and what is

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,840
important is this thing looks like and
you can see that

38
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:44,049
symmetric in the horizontal axis and
there are points and these points play

39
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,910
an important role as you may remember
from secondary school is born Stanley

40
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,329
represented by

41
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:56,280
and I will assume that all of these
things but I'm cutting corners at a

42
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,320
computer represents a point by a number
so when's the numbers are the same thing

43
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:09,000
so an important operation thanks to
appoint Deanna points at the line

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,250
through being you and this fact just
need to believe me that's always a third

45
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,440
points on the curve but also on this
line and as a symmetric in the

46
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,040
horizontal axis so you can take the
mirror image that points the third

47
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,890
points and we called a rescue I cannot
stress enough that is not supposed to

48
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,940
make any sense

49
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,640
mathematics students when they first
learned it doesn't make any sense to

50
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:45,860
them either I'm not explaining to you
what the defining something and you will

51
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:55,270
never make senator is thought to minutes
and is called point edition on a special

52
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,219
case if you want to add a point p2
itself B-plus paid so much to do in this

53
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,870
case thank the tangent lines and unique
line that touches to curb at the

54
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,830
hallways unique line and as an RSS top
point on the curve and also on the line

55
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,370
you think the mirror image of that point
point of speed must be actually call

56
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:22,140
this dude I'm state and at some point
doubling and we can combine this we can

57
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:33,520
combine point additional point doubling
by adding to the third point gets to

58
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:43,090
speak and we expect from a three-time
state champion 5006 time space and its

59
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,008
operations in the temptation

60
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:52,509
so we can to ask points to get a just to
find that we also define how to multiply

61
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:58,639
points and it turns out that whatever
you would expect from addition

62
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,419
multiplication all these rules worked as
a test case and everything falls into

63
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:05,369
place

64
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:10,990
mathematics often very nice like and it
may be remembered as the points on a

65
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,529
curve for $100 billion group and it's
very useful for crypto and especially

66
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:20,939
has a very nice property is that we can
do this another patient very fast so you

67
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:25,969
want to go for a point beyond to compute
a hundred times it's fact that it needs

68
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:34,748
ninety nine Steps ninety nine editions
and actually eight stops this will cost

69
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:39,800
you don't worry about it just eight
steps but if you've ever implemented

70
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,149
cost exponentiation in a programming
language it's a very same principle and

71
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:50,830
if the numbers are even bigger ones you
only so much more so blind by a billion

72
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,859
thanks 50 steps and an actual even less
if you do slightly faster and

73
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,259
multiplying by enormous numbers ripped
out takes a few hundred steps

74
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:11,330
operation is very slow so what i mean
you are given two points on the same

75
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,818
girl B&Q and bombs be for some number
and which may be on its maybe fifty

76
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:27,639
billion during the only way to find his
number and is to try to get to do this

77
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:39,409
extremely slow numbers than computers
under US command station being very fast

78
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:40,979
and division

79
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:46,229
very slow the discrete logarithm problem
for elliptic curves and that's the basis

80
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:53,039
of the most probably most common
implementation is elliptic curve

81
00:07:53,729 --> 00:08:00,919
and its relation with Allison ball 12
agreed on a secret key over public

82
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:07,370
channel and I wrote right agree because
they don't so much agreed that it

83
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:13,789
generates together over public channel
for example Alice being a web browser

84
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:22,498
but her and they they need to get a key
to encrypt TLS session so what happens

85
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:27,710
if that's how I agree publicly over Nick
certain elliptic curves to use and

86
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:36,139
appoints be on that girl analysis uses a
lot secret random number of very large

87
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:41,669
number and he joins us a lot since then
the number big numbers don't tell them

88
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:48,329
throughout our don't share it with
anyone else computes a time speeds eight

89
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:54,170
times two points the S&P for even if
he's very light switch it will be very

90
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:00,910
fast and he said this answer would be
that sword with computer number B and

91
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:11,110
said his bouts to Alice think this point
be times when Dave her and she flies by

92
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:17,380
a by her number she could speak and like
my spot computes be times a time space

93
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,839
and as I said before mathematics

94
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,329
the market expects work so eight times
and becomes a dime speak the same number

95
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:31,060
and if you think a little bit about the
problem and it's something you should

96
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:38,709
think about anyone who would intercept
the program occasion correct the scheme

97
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:51,219
is a way to generate as it is used a lot
in your browser and it is very bored you

98
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,540
can read the RC's defining the last in
the Helmand in there and you can

99
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,410
actually find the numbers

100
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,750
points that are shared with Wireshark
but it's it's a good morning and put in

101
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:10,430
the time to explain his second
implementation that's random number

102
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:17,109
generators and as you probably know
computers are inherently bad at random

103
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,029
testing that's going to feature of
computers there are two things extremely

104
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:25,819
predict now you just can't do things
randomly for example they write

105
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:30,069
something too distant measure how long
it takes and invested in 90 seconds

106
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:34,319
taking the last two digits that's kind
of a random number but that's not good

107
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:35,349
enough

108
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:42,339
a lot more random so this is a random
number generator as an imported exxon

109
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:56,209
through run into some kind of magnetism
algorithm generates somehow thought the

110
00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:03,569
true random outfits and rest of the set
back into the mechanism and so on my

111
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:08,810
next yeah I was amazing just like some
machine at the Children's out random

112
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:15,689
numbers of employees around the number
once I remember that the discrete

113
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:19,019
logarithm problem one way to look at it

114
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:25,550
appoint a number of different point B
and blunt speech this doesn't tell you

115
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,120
anything about and so basically it looks
around themselves and other random

116
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,329
number then the next number the enzyme
speech appoint / number is again very

117
00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:42,339
random so I just work so we start with a
number and 0 it's like a true random

118
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:48,910
number one at the computer access to but
nothing and we think and 08 number and

119
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:56,529
10 and 11 speak in an unknown number of
points that number and to accept the

120
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,459
random number generator assists and bond
and two and three Test series of random

121
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:04,319
numbers to these are random numbers
except this one problem

122
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,990
a property of random number generator
this is that they sometimes Shadowrun

123
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:15,480
members publicly which means that
anniversary sometimes it has access to

124
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,460
anyone and I thought it was not a bug
that feature but if if they have access

125
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:25,740
to anyone they can compute and through
and an ensuite a speech public access to

126
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:32,720
NY the whole random number generator
which you don't run the numbers I

127
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,500
suppose the verdict but we can modify it
a bit by an extra point so now we have

128
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:46,830
the curve with dew points P&Q and we
thank and zero and because I'm gonna

129
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:53,940
form I think it's a 32 bytes 32 bytes
per annum and again we take and zero

130
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:01,100
time speed and one but now we don't just
think and 10 and 12 that's another 32

131
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:07,050
bytes points that number is no way to
first two bytes 30 bytes and it still

132
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:18,170
run them out again we think and one-time
speed and two and 2:30 by starr offsets

133
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,610
the next round about goods and remember
it's the discrete logarithm problem

134
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:26,730
means that you can go from and one
bronze cute and one so you can't

135
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:35,390
practice and it's a credit where
credit's due to the idea of this light

136
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,810
on the next 12 percent of his white
baseball talk about one song by Dan

137
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:46,819
Bernstein and now there's an interesting
fact that there is a large number D

138
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:54,060
the Eagles D times and good luck with
the problem that you can't crack date

139
00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:00,790
but imagine someone somehow has access
to this number D what can they do well

140
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:09,449
and that's unrelated to the only have
230 bite out of 32 but that's only

141
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,110
65,000 possibilities

142
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,889
it's a very easy

143
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:23,829
it were used to get the full amount of
32 bytes and let's go to our bond and at

144
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:35,049
first we have access to our one now I
claim the D times are wanted this magic

145
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:40,790
number Deedat imagine someone has access
to it hypothetically is the same as to

146
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:51,290
why that's quite simple so into it by
definition and one time space and that

147
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:58,439
was the Eagles defense cute as we said
you can't change the order already used

148
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:05,169
before so that's a 2d times a month I'm
skew and I don't think you are 10

149
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:10,619
someone who has access to do and someone
who can read our one purchase something

150
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:18,209
happen again soon and too sorry and the
next random number an extra number and

151
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:24,609
again the algorithm so the million
dollar question or past the 10 million

152
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:31,230
dollar question is who knows deep well
this is an estimate for that and the

153
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:37,730
finest internets and attacks on the
second page so proud to stand up

154
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,619
gratefully acknowledges and appreciates
contributions by Mike Boyle and

155
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:54,209
memory-based from folks have cast album
Julie C Dr Beeching which has been

156
00:15:54,209 --> 00:16:00,309
making the news a lot in recent years
and I should also point out I suggested

157
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:02,839
it was a good idea to use it at the
girls ran the numbers

158
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:07,829
madrina have written a great blog post
for example it is extremely slow

159
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:13,049
algorithm so even if no one knew d just
a bad idea

160
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:19,608
again recently at Juniper and

161
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:30,170
you can read it but a general public he
sat in on his website that they used due

162
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,209
Dec but they use different points so in
its screen OS operating system that use

163
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:43,430
different points of view that's fine I
mean very slow random numbers and that's

164
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:54,589
a promise notes your promises customers
they need memory in saudi treats ok but

165
00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:01,440
in practice the number generator and it
turns out that someone somehow managed

166
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,860
to change the points P&Q the different
not have generated when a new number

167
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:15,030
deep but the interview where supposedly
this China Russia however new number

168
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:26,170
Dina at the saudi relationship between
these two are doing he said yeah bTW

169
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:34,120
wondering rightly is there anything else
that DNA tests and actually it's good to

170
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:40,669
point out that the curse that are used
in Helmand in your browser 26 that's

171
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,560
that's a girl with a point on it they
use some poor concentrate on not only

172
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:54,970
explain and we can't fully excluded the
back door but they weren't chosen a very

173
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,620
close to that as a reason the back door
and there probably isn't such a back

174
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:07,669
door but we should aim as a matter of
principle mouse to use curves that are

175
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,780
better off not mysterious

176
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:17,470
small number if you ever seeker 2519
which then bernstein invented that such

177
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:24,930
a girl and it is also easy to implement
want to read more about this and if you

178
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:32,430
want to see the theory that the NSA has
backed or obese curves debunks desecrate

179
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:43,220
baby by new offer a minute or so to
round off the curve cryptography is it a

180
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,220
good idea in general because you can do
it much monarchies domestic getting

181
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:58,530
faster and increase your keys 26 bit and
if the crypto case by the same currency

182
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:08,860
as 3072 bit so just as much as much
memory doesn't take much basis door keys

183
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:16,770
but is also big weakness and it's just
complicated the most complicated mas

184
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:22,840
effort but that's a market most students
about medics will never come across and

185
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:30,310
it's also implicitly sound that uses
complicated modest is a strong points

186
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,770
and actually I think it's a weakness I
mean if you use you don't understand

187
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:42,580
then you may need to trust someone else
and RSA is amazing and I think there are

188
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,919
not able to understand this we should
use it but we should be wary of you

189
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:56,650
should really consider this way because
I didn't think I would have six minutes

190
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,200
left questions but at the same time
progresses I'll be speaking at a

191
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,720
conference in town on Thursday morning
by a different topic but there any mail

192
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:46,200
yea well known derivation constants
Constance is that enough to at least

193
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:56,740
create the correct in somebody does
realize that we have wholly public

194
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:09,060
relations does that make us in practice
yes and a problem isn't here you can

195
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:14,840
generate to run them curves in a way
around the boys and a girl we notice you

196
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,459
can show no one to find the deed is why
because my two boys shirts too obvious

197
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:29,000
points something and we nowadays D but
we also know we contribute about

198
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:38,460
vulnerability of DCC to quantum
cryptography I mean shooting was worried

199
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,580
that someone would ask about quantum
computing I know very little about

200
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:55,889
quantum computing I think in general is
vulnerable to quantum so I am part of

201
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,280
your audience can you back to this light
on details to you

202
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,370
early slide it going

203
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:18,059
getting here when you drop the first
line yes I do you know the angle to try

204
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:24,418
it it's still the same angle as the line
from e3 cue and you're just moving it to

205
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:33,129
a different point on the curve when you
transition from here to the next slide

206
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:39,658
this one yes when you drive back line is
it just keeping the same angle for that

207
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:45,659
line and moving the starting point to a
different point on the curve now it is a

208
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:54,159
coincidence angle is more necessary now
it for any points on a graph not even if

209
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,470
the girls there's a unique line that
goes to the point and it goes through it

210
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:07,759
all at once that that you said that it's
like making you take to move him closer

211
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:14,570
you know what happens to the line 32
points and at some point the points

212
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:19,908
altogether and I see said the tank I
will change depending on where you put

213
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:51,139
that there is that RSA its definitions
up the ball and for elliptic curves we

214
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:56,610
don't know yet nobody's figured out how
but everybody does it's a short nothing

215
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:05,769
about them but for right now it looks
like probably not vulnerable has been

216
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:10,970
told that source algorithm which is used
to record as a at least in theory it

217
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,280
works against the girls there I

218
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,670
yeah democrats believe there are people
who think we might never be able to

219
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:25,330
crack some of them I'm not an expert I
mean I worry about gun computing mostly

220
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:33,760
because now I understand the crypto with
him I won't have to trust other people

221
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,650
and that's that's three questions
