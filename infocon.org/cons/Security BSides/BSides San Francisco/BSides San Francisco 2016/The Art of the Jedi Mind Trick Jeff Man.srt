1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,089
join things a little different so I'm
one of the organizers this is Jeff man

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:12,179
you were her terrible tenable has been
supporting b-sides for many years and if

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,139
you've been Danny the sessions and
narrated by tenable is a very good

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,230
sponsor when you think about security
you should think about the ball and Jeff

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:27,590
right just past 30 years experience as a
thirty minute presentation turn it over

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,019
to you and Mark ready set go

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:43,920
thank his side since the day and I hope
it's not just because it's not great so

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,280
is my name

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,820
security is my game I've been in the
industry probably about 34 years really

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,149
if you add it all up that's what I used
to look like and you can hardly see it

11
00:00:55,149 --> 00:01:04,729
but you said that was my passport or if
you're interested afterwards getting in

12
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,119
touch with me I can certainly share my
contact information since it's mostly

13
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:13,080
washed out but it's also up there at Mr
Jackman on Twitter let me jump into this

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,710
the art of the Jedi mind trick person
it's very short order

15
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:25,869
why I consider myself a Jedi Master talk
about the problem that I'm guessing what

16
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:31,259
I think's missing next steps will have
time for some you and so we're gonna

17
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:38,619
jump right into it a long time ago I saw
the original Star Wars in the theaters

18
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:41,619
and I was in junior high and mighty with
me

19
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:48,560
the bartenders for both are they called
it a passive episode was a star wars

20
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,169
throw this up here and risk having
stone's throw up thrown at me I began my

21
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:02,780
career at that raised and I started out
there is a crypt analysts and I moved on

22
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,119
years later and information security
analyst work which got me into

23
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:15,050
penetration testing back in the early
days back in the mid nineties when I was

24
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,209
getting involved in cryptography this is
the kind of stuff but I worked with

25
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:23,470
can't know what it is it's a one-time
pad he was done on paper back in those

26
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,739
days and we broke it with graph paper
and colored pencils but the computer

27
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:33,160
came along and restarted automated
things in terms of cryptography and we

28
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,320
started taking things like one-time pads
and putting them into computer programs

29
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,609
and using IBM PCs before they were
network so there is a little bit better

30
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:50,640
global security on things in context
when I started working at an assay it

31
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,079
was still a secret that we had broken
the encryption of the Enigma machine

32
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,410
that wasn't published until

33
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,790
made public until the late eighties why
was it a secret cuz there were still

34
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,929
some countries that were using it

35
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:14,400
think about anywhere and that's a 1996
this is not a went out into the

36
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,700
commercial sector and started out doing
pen testing which turned out to be a lot

37
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,290
of vulnerability assessment and it was
the early days we're trying to convince

38
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:29,280
companies have a firewall gonna be on
the internet since like that and really

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,989
it was the beginning developing anytime
I percents having a security program

40
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,549
having an account policies any kind of
concept of what they are trying to

41
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:43,739
accomplish security so there was a lot
of Education's security program

42
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,470
development architecture developments
and things like that somewhere along the

43
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,540
line

44
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:56,010
PCI PCI purgatory I ended up doing she
was safe for ten years

45
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,519
luckily I was released from PCR work I
was hired by terrible about two and a

46
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,150
half years ago brought on as he says
subject matter expert I do security as

47
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,590
well

48
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,489
twenty years of experience before I get
into into PCI work which brings me up to

49
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:20,858
today I went around last year at several
different comp conferences user events

50
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:24,210
ordinary events things like their
potential and I give a talk called the

51
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,210
state of information security today are
we getting any better

52
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:32,289
one of the things I observed as I was
going to all sorts of different

53
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:36,690
conferences and I won't name doesn't
matter I heard a lot of really smart

54
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,229
people giving a lot of really
interesting fascinating talks but he's

55
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:46,210
noticed in the last couple years there's
a lot of breaches reported in the news

56
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,719
or slaughter fraud happening just gave a
fraud talk a little while ago the bad

57
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,860
guys figured out how to monetize
breaking into things in compromising

58
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,639
data and you're coming from the PCR
background research so many retail

59
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,419
bridges in the last couple years

60
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:10,180
power in times like that I was I was
doing some soul-searching are we doing

61
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,650
any better as an industry when things
are bad regions are still happening and

62
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:21,580
you find out that the causes are default
setting default passwords never being

63
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,080
changed weak passwords and my gosh
that's that's how I was breaking into

64
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,760
stuff twenty years ago so talk about
what's wrong with the industry and how

65
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,080
we can change it but also heard a lot of
people talking about problems and I

66
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:43,090
thought to myself maybe part of the
problem is US Navy were not good at

67
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,380
communicating maybe we're having a hard
time getting the point across because

68
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:53,509
here for various reasons were not
practice at communicating maybe we don't

69
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,599
get the opportunity to stand up and
tribal groups very often maybe we're not

70
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:00,610
going in front of the board of directors

71
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:06,030
our boss or the staff meetings or
whatever so this is where I started

72
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,809
having this idea maybe I need to talk
about some of the things that I know

73
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:13,960
I've done for many years down he didn't
really know what they what the

74
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,979
techniques are that I'm doing so I tried
to figure out what it is what is it that

75
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:22,240
I do cause I know how to go into a
company sit down with a group of people

76
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,719
rather their executives or whether
they're technologists whether the

77
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:31,949
administrators management techniques and
I can pretty fairly often get a good

78
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,120
rapport with them not always there's
certainly no hostile environments that

79
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,889
are you into her have gone in June but I
found that are pretty good at getting

80
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:46,879
the point across teaching security
concepts getting my customers to

81
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,490
understand that in always do what I
thought that needed to do but I could

82
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,789
least make a more educated given so that
they had an informed decision

83
00:06:55,789 --> 00:06:59,400
respects decision when they were
deciding not to do what they need to do

84
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,888
or maybe we found a compromise somewhere
along the line so this is just in the

85
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,509
last year to salute big companies like I
said this is kind of what I've been

86
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:15,969
worried about that this is sort of this
is Amin was out on Twitter's about in

87
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,110
the last week

88
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:26,949
take a second to read it I don't read
slides to people you read this you can

89
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:30,409
take a lot of things away from it and
certainly there's truth in this year

90
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:35,610
when I read this I thought gee this is
sort of encapsulating what I'm seeing as

91
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,460
I get out into the community that
hackers community these different

92
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,698
conferences sometimes we know what the
answer is we know what needs to be done

93
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:50,789
but if we can't communicate that I think
we're just as much responsible and

94
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:55,240
that's my easing into this message how
do we do better it indicated

95
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,479
so this is gonna be like fast some of
the things the techniques and

96
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,110
methodologies that I use for
communicating over the years as I'm

97
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:14,479
approaching customers as I'm talking to
groups and things like that very first

98
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,008
thing and then some of these things
you've probably heard before her talks

99
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:25,009
know your audience when I got started in
the in the pen testing business twenty

100
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,750
years ago we didn't have Google search
engines there I would try to figure out

101
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,659
if I was going into a company will know
what type of company was where the

102
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,849
report the managing editor of the people
I'm gonna meet find out what their

103
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:44,370
background is what are their likes and
their interests and that was there is a

104
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,120
couple of reasons back then it was more
tactical like it they loved Corvettes

105
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,890
that'd be the first passport I try when
I was trying to help their their account

106
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:57,480
but also it gives you the ability to
find out where they're coming from so

107
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,620
just as an example by show of hands and
there's no right or wrong answer is

108
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,829
gonna be mad at you or anything but in
terms of the best movie that's out there

109
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:12,300
these days who thinks it's black hat
raise your hand

110
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:23,469
same Dubai starring enemy of the state
got one more gains got a few more knows

111
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:32,149
the bottom right is swordfish anyone not
just because of how very but for the

112
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:40,149
hacking elements firewall hackers how to
do I actually watched hackers on what's

113
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:45,560
just a couple nights ago and it was a
humorous look down memory lane sneakers

114
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:54,660
think the consensus in this audiences
between sneakers and wordings enemy of

115
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,760
the state by the way is kind of my peers
as it's about where I used to work in

116
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,230
its fun to watch

117
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,890
fictional movies about NSA has their
only guessing what it's really like

118
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:08,460
there there's a scene an enemy of the
state where the the black limousine the

119
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:16,570
bad guy deputy director used to work for
drives into the glass cubicle building

120
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,310
down this ramp always chuckle because
that's actually the loading dock where

121
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:27,109
they used to bring the food trucks into
the cafeteria at a secret about inner

122
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,330
city but anyway when when you when you
ask questions like this

123
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,280
of an audience of a group you get a
sense of your just in the responses what

124
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,199
type of person they are everybody hates
black hat would take away from that is

125
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,070
information the difference between
wordings knickers is what kind of

126
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,760
introduced social engineer little bit
workings to see courses did so everybody

127
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,319
that like Snickers the best I'm thinking
you guys part love social engineer

128
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,240
that's that's that's a technique I don't
know the name of it here's the biggest

129
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:09,020
and you listen I used to go into
companies and just ask what probably

130
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,850
trying to solve and I listen to him talk
usually they had no clue and even to

131
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,980
this day very often companies don't
really know what they're trying to get

132
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,340
to their objective with their goal is
why I gotta do security and compliance

133
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,680
standard this is just having a
conversation about what is it you're

134
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,030
trying to protect listening to them
articulated hearing that is a clue how

135
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,890
to you you you log that and then use
that as a technique later on when you're

136
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:45,330
trying to describe this so listening is
important thing and they told me that is

137
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,330
sort of a movie thing talk

138
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:58,599
I believe very strongly and I've said
for years that on buy link im able to

139
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,720
talk Tech Talk protectees but I've also
been able to talk now on technically to

140
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,449
the non-technical folks who are usually
the decision-makers and organizations

141
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:14,790
and and the best analogy I can use of
why you need to learn languages have you

142
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:20,290
ever seen somebody in maybe you done it
for so tried to talk to either a deaf

143
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,019
person or somebody that speaks a foreign
language we tend to talk

144
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:34,939
lo li and they're really loudly and I
suggest to you if you don't hear me or

145
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:40,179
speak the language that doesn't happen I
don't care how slow you talk to me if I

146
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:45,179
don't speak your language can understand
a word you say it's more work to speak

147
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:51,040
the language of the customer I used to
get this alot with PCI work as I used to

148
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,959
get caught in auditor albert say I'm not
an auditor of an assessor the PCI

149
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:01,089
compliance process is an assessment not
an audit but you know at the end of the

150
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:04,829
day says that to the customers they
wanted to call me an auditor I was in

151
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:10,969
order when rdy it's very good very
important sometimes to break it down

152
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,919
what you're trying to play in terms of
technical issue or what you're trying to

153
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,860
get them to you in terms of objectives
to tell stories come up with an hour

154
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:28,699
it's really get it I'm not but I trust
what I have found over the years is yet

155
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:33,758
to be very careful in the analogies use
a white male I tend to like to use

156
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:40,209
sports analogies I love football
baseball basketball else does so sports

157
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:43,368
analogies don't often work sometimes
they do sometimes they don't

158
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:50,459
into foreign countries where I see
myself using colloquialisms and and and

159
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,849
phrases that are very familiar in the
English language or the region in which

160
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,110
I live in as unsafe

161
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,579
I realize this person from wherever I am
has no idea what I'm talking about

162
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:04,709
because they've never heard the strays
and of course they can have reasons to

163
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:15,510
that don't mean anything to us Americans
this is a topic they fish if you're

164
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:21,740
missing the elliptic curve talk here's
my one purpose I am a credentials by

165
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:28,089
trade I am primarily a manual and honest
I've done designed codes are broken

166
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:34,370
codes and I i cant deal to curb type
talks but for most people when you start

167
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,920
talking elliptic curves and large random
numbers and soon around them and this

168
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,920
that and the other a lot of times it
goes over people's heads so I just break

169
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,649
it down to there's something that you
have that's readable text you have to do

170
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,769
some kind of fancy maps combined with
some kind of random which is akin said

171
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:58,070
called a key now produces echoed that
usually explains it for most people and

172
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,320
we know the details if you need to get
when do I can go into a but for the most

173
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,899
part

174
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:10,649
breaking it down gets the point across
because many of you probably work for

175
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:13,870
companies where there's business
decisions that have to be made based on

176
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,170
things like profitability and margins
and revenue and things like that it's

177
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,269
important to learn a little bit about
the business there should be an easy

178
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:26,880
office space yes I'm a people person

179
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:35,329
well there's no way you're gonna guess
that would help if I told you thats

180
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:43,300
Samuel L Jackson now that's good yes

181
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:48,490
don't assume that people are
understanding what your talking on the

182
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:54,190
first time ass when you're explaining
something to somebody asked him was just

183
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:01,350
him he's very often I found out I was so
you have to regroup and try again and

184
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,340
again don't say the same thing over you
try a different approach try try a

185
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,790
different analogy the person didn't work
try something different

186
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:19,420
the clue is the assumption don't assume
anything is this the slides will be up

187
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:26,329
on the website later and see what this
was really important especially when we

188
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,480
were coming in doing well on durability
assistance to companies ur you're giving

189
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,940
them a gap assessment on this is all bad
things truly are

190
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,970
it's a psychological thing and I learned
this from from my parents and my child

191
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:44,620
who don't start with the bad you know
give some people some props you know

192
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:52,270
well your website has some pretty colors
I like the way it's organized but you

193
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:56,160
know we found a few issues with cross
site scripting and explain what that

194
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,589
means and why it's bad and then get down
to the bone by the way there is a

195
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:06,840
default password there and that caused
us to village over on your entire

196
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,929
environment but you know work into it I
learned this from my childhood as I said

197
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,680
because I never got straight A's as a
child and the closest I got one time I

198
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:23,050
came home with 6 A's and a be and the
first thing my dad says I get in that

199
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,940
quarter so scarred from that but I tried
to take that as a life lesson in my

200
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:35,200
consulting career that's a real broad
overview techniques that the

201
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,350
fundamentals there are good
communication skills really what we're

202
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:46,310
talking about and getting having the
opportunity to practice how do we move

203
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:53,550
on who's ready for the Reds who wants
the blue pill and everybody knows what

204
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,550
this movie is a major

205
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:10,570
you fail the class the message here is
don't give up you know you gotta keep

206
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,939
trying and even though the common sense
might tell you the way you know those

207
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,670
people are too stupid ever understand
you gotta keep going and in fact I I

208
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:26,230
kinda think the challenge of going into
an environment where I need to convey

209
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:33,030
educating teach weighed an audience
group company I considered puzzle and

210
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,620
again

211
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,780
security very often is described as a
game but when you think of it as a

212
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:44,410
somewhere in there very often there's
more than one solution so keep that is a

213
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:51,470
frame of reference and understand that
sometimes especially if you're in a

214
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,180
monolithic company a large company
that's been set in their ways or they

215
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,400
they they think that they've got limited
budget you know they're stretched thin

216
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,940
they can't invest one more thing in one
more nuclear gee whiz thing that you

217
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,450
want them to do you know keep in mind
that it takes time so the analogy here

218
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:20,430
is takes time to steer the Titanic from
and this is so summarized in these are

219
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:25,300
good communications part of the Jedi
mind trick I believe you have

220
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,120
information that you need to convey to
another person to another group you need

221
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,290
to break it down in such a way that they
understand because security is really

222
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:40,540
reason with the end of the day in most
cases and logical arguments logical

223
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,300
rational reasoning can be given to
people and they should be able to draw

224
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,280
the same logical conclusion that you
have without the emotional excitement

225
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,649
the pizzazz and the technical details
just break it down into language they

226
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:02,200
can understand a lot of background in
terms of listening to them and sharing

227
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,480
you know what their challenges are and
and being able to modify the solution I

228
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,720
i my favorite thing was always offer
three solutions and there is the you

229
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,910
know do nothing approach there was the
ultra high level you know you have all

230
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,440
the money in the time and resources in
the world you could do this where

231
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,950
there's some middle ground and of course
where I wanted them was in the middle

232
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:30,390
ground they'd obviously rule out the one
in obviously rule out higher in and then

233
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,760
we talked about that middle ground and
there is usually some negotiation there

234
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,410
as well but when they walk away they
felt like they'd made an informed

235
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,380
decision I felt better as I thought that
they'd need an informed decision they

236
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,530
were finally walking off exposing
themselves the risks were but it was a

237
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,330
calculated risk it was a risk that they
were willing to take on and that also

238
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,720
gave them directions for what they need
to do in terms of security moving

239
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,540
forward which was may be increased
monitoring increased awareness closed at

240
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,810
nine outta 10 holes but you can't close
that poll watching carefully to make

241
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,070
sure nothing is coming through that all
the end of the day

242
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,800
movie very good any questions

243
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:47,530
pushed back yes go get a new job or they
don't know is my experience has been I

244
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:54,129
get to get to come in as a consultant
expert and I used to joke with Ashley a

245
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,520
technique used to use the winner of the
security guys Eid guys and say hey guys

246
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,300
what do you need especially for PCR has
you know your environment better you

247
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,730
know what you need if I saw PCI get it
and I'll be your friends I used to joke

248
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,960
that had this magic that I could just
get things

249
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,340
I'm experiencing the challenges of
working for a company now trying to

250
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:22,149
educate and ship them into a different
directions and it is a lot harder I

251
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:27,220
think and experience the near the looks
of oh here it comes again and they

252
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,460
turned the other way I think it's more
slow more methodical yet to be more

253
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,570
patient and kind of pick your battles
and and and and try to make small wins

254
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,990
and again it's more important than ever
to try to give the information in such a

255
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:53,890
way with your management and try not to
say I saw this and they said it very

256
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,620
flat in a flurry manner but it was
basically I told you so I had to do that

257
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:09,429
is a question I answered questions
before we even have that is the art of

258
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:19,980
the general manager if you really super
interested this is really a presentation

259
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:26,750
enters Circle City in June giving a
training course for some of these things

260
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,490
that I've talked about in the last 15 20
minutes actually give you guys the

261
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:37,000
opportunity to practice the opportunity
to speak the opportunity to in Iraq

262
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,110
which I think sometimes we don't get and
I'm hoping it's a theory that that'll

263
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,250
help all of us do better in our jobs

264
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,250
yes

265
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:03,658
basic

266
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:12,470
have a strong password and change it not
use the same password that they're using

267
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:23,299
122 pounds of her just those are the
basics that were still feel like I've

268
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:37,149
start their user Wow hundred-percent

269
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:48,559
know but again some organizations some
organizations want the quality to me

270
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,220
it's more the trick of knowing what they
want to hear and knowing what's know

271
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:59,039
what they're going to respond to what's
the triggers and to me it takes practice

272
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,158
and it's it's learning how to pick up an
excuse which again is it's a technique

273
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,340
that i've learn that I hope I tried to
identify them but there's probably more

274
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,509
out there as well

275
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:28,629
yeah it's hard to push security problem
here

276
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,849
orkut expenses which is what they want
to hear but to have a responsible

277
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:41,139
meaningful reasonable message this is
why it's not a necessary investment and

278
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:46,820
this is without doing too much but this
is the bad could happen but again

279
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,470
there's a balance there so to me it's
all being reactionary yes

280
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,730
actively hostile manner

281
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:06,309
probably regroup and try to find a
sympathetic to your somewhere else and

282
