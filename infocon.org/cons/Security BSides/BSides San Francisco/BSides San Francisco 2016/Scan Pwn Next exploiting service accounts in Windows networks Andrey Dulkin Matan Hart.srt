1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,730
now speaking into a microphone

2
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:50,780
another Mike Cameron you're working poor
start at once again say thank you to our

3
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:57,260
boxers they're right there take a look
they've been very helpful in this whole

4
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,070
thing on her mind going to take back the
lipid backwards out there is one on the

5
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,880
schedule website and there's also one on
your ticket in your email so please do

6
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:17,419
that at this site like to each entry and
talk to talk about let's see ya next

7
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,890
thanks

8
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:31,040
hi guys so welcoming everybody good
afternoon and we're going to waste gas

9
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,759
service accounts so if bodies here we'll
just get started

10
00:01:41,450 --> 00:02:41,019
this rumor that yeah okay for those who
haven't you must go it's so since the

11
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:47,600
data up two days in a row but they left
his changing industry in our networks

12
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,170
but one thing remains or very long time
our service is an automated process both

13
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,708
operate our environment

14
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:02,590
accessible stop and all services at
weekend we are going to discuss powell's

15
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:09,299
services in the council also use boats
are networks to attacks by attackers

16
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,299
what you can do about it

17
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:22,980
so are we mining is under the head of
research labs and I've been doing

18
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:31,780
research for the last 15 years in my
spare time i three developments in

19
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:39,720
Europe at some interesting that project
would like to hear about them and I am

20
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:54,420
an art that family I was indeed an idea
and then I'd like to meet this evening

21
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:07,220
so patient protocol based on the tickets
and security in women's networks and a

22
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,489
domain controller responsible for an
indication and it uses their bosses

23
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:13,530
demain

24
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:21,899
and the default down occasion Chronicle
but however has been home but each time

25
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:30,620
so how to service know who to offer I so
Microsoft extended the cameras political

26
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,430
additional authorization that they are
also known as block which include

27
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:42,140
information directory such as group
membership occasions halos and 11 hours

28
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,820
so there are so

29
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,460
the service can cite authorised base
that information

30
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:58,549
ticket service account our principles
and that's running services and I use

31
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,510
that the security context and they said

32
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:14,840
so those networks are two main accounts
and computer out there are making some

33
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,400
tests such as

34
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:26,049
retrieving and antitrust laws and are
used by the computer and you are used by

35
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,050
human resources such as

36
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,090
because there's no service accounts
Active Directory usually the computer

37
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,919
account will be used

38
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,610
as the account for these services
running on but sometimes even done that

39
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,530
user accounts are you human

40
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:55,940
will be used to check the service so
when we are you see a user accounts as

41
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:03,610
so basically we had services automated
process and there are many differences

42
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:11,470
between counsel and accounts for almost
there

43
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:21,710
fact that they must work for results say
our standard users are changing the

44
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,880
password every 90 days it's very open
that account

45
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:34,130
there's fossils are set to never expire
and a possible complex it is also often

46
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:39,500
the case that there's also counts can be
over privileged ensure all over floor

47
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:47,590
similar website where people figure in
order for some serbs work and one of the

48
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,289
recommendations that they usually get
you probably don't have sufficient

49
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:58,600
permissions or some privileges just
trade and then configure it later to

50
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,630
reduce it and then later time over there
are issues

51
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:14,000
delegation we are not going to go into
that but you have some ways to delegate

52
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:22,719
others and General Tso's dark though say
service accounts expose larger that's

53
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,560
when we talk about the talks are
basically we mean is that doctors more

54
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,790
waste than standard for example

55
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:42,900
said that this account it's running so
perhaps that serves as sample then

56
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,179
hijacked prudential

57
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:55,250
say that this and it can get there might
be a higher than the term as opposed to

58
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:05,110
you human users are just using 10 their
differences here and in general we

59
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:13,270
discuss the terminology here is our own
but it makes it easy to distinguish

60
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:24,020
between those services that are that are
using accounts out of the network and we

61
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:34,970
have services that are decent income we
are going to eat there so we'll start

62
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:45,630
out so that are going to happen

63
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:53,540
about a year ago the major retailer
where an attacker there were able to

64
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:02,280
hide of a single trouble sales
organization and I T

65
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,740
organization said that that guy fucks

66
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:18,660
so it wasn't such a sophisticated hot
but all that I forgot was waiting for

67
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:27,569
people that are now that's all that I
were able to find machine network in on

68
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,160
those machines

69
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,260
multi-quote

70
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,790
figure to operate inside the network
conduct various thoughts all of the

71
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:46,579
admin account ok so people here know
that this problematic and what that they

72
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,260
use that those credentials north to get
the point

73
00:09:50,260 --> 00:10:01,939
sales receipts for sale device where
they stole credit card so that single

74
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,940
account

75
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:25,220
once again don't want a reason unknown
intruder penetrated using superuser

76
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:33,970
account giving them access which would
be to prevent someone didn't bother

77
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:43,030
reading my mom used now that his ISO
meticulous passwords are loud sex

78
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:48,160
secrets so when your holiness

79
00:10:51,670 --> 00:11:04,020
ok this movie's record what year 1995 so
very twenty-year-old discussing the same

80
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,650
problem we are doing this day there are
super user accounts in our network that

81
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:17,380
doctors will enable them to do what they
once the net and buried over people are

82
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:23,170
so there's no research

83
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:34,689
dozens of a real networks we have our
site where the innate retool that and if

84
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:46,040
you rob and basically what it doesn't
count the network and it looks great but

85
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:57,449
also for where the credentials of Gaza
its mission over 70 networks in or just

86
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:08,030
DNA various networks for example found
the server where we're all the domain

87
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:15,810
users where our users so basically an
administrator and network on that server

88
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:29,040
with jokes cars so in this case and they
count description says who was to be the

89
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,660
break so disabled and then became great

90
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:42,279
September 9 we found that counts

91
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:48,980
set up with administrative accounts so
get my pic overflow right examples where

92
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,510
somebody set up a temporary account
Rancic its privileges and it just gets

93
00:12:53,510 --> 00:13:05,200
there we found Exodus here but basically
application that is being used by

94
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:13,490
security control network where somebody
description so as you all know that

95
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:21,890
Congress is available to me that's nice
one of the things that we do with DNA

96
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,870
map

97
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:33,709
credentials in the network now whenever
your computer to machine you actually

98
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:41,540
kills onset machine right because these
are the hatch sometimes apostle itself

99
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:52,589
is so what we doing that and error
saying on that server to the result

100
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:58,500
credential that could be used by the
doctor again that really just to let

101
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:13,880
alone get spots are others that I we are
just met routes take inside what else

102
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,910
can you can see here we natural
anonymous those accounts but you can see

103
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:24,230
there you can see whether it is used by
Sarah process you can see the threat

104
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:34,360
counties are coming out of the thousands
of armaments there are the victims would

105
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:42,020
be compromised the groups that account
belonged with a possible and password

106
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,060
whether it never set to never wire and
you can see for example this account you

107
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:54,160
can read and the Sun gets us but service
account prison over three hundred

108
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:02,610
machines the credential are presently
overstreet they can be used over South

109
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:14,370
the network the password you can see
here is fights they all thought and the

110
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:20,420
password naturalist never saw this
president was credentials are pregnant

111
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,899
or more assertively machines can be used
to compromise in time and what we do a

112
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,839
metric in with all the networks

113
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:37,839
exactly three groups the Lower East
Media Research than the IRA and this is

114
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:46,829
just the reason according to seven then
again you can see why but or forty

115
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:55,609
percent of the networks step bro I
double duty service accounts being

116
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,180
present the majority of the machines in
them not just now but the credentials

117
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:10,180
will provide so he'll provide their
recent say and adults and you are able

118
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,390
to see some more details on it but the
proper credentials

119
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:23,890
in those services about them in person
he's a real one and actually present an

120
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:32,480
important point to note here is that we
set that those are all process it is

121
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,180
often the case that this same account

122
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:47,040
partly by exposure because those behind

123
00:16:50,750 --> 00:17:02,500
out so basically all those operating in
the network now we are those that are

124
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
associated with Vince

125
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:28,280
so basically what each services they can
be said and the domain and so those are

126
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:37,440
used those are contained the service
type the hostname services so actually

127
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:45,610
when computers you actually request
access the service services on that

128
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:51,620
computer so if you have a shared printer
you actually request axis

129
00:17:52,200 --> 00:18:04,390
be fine in 2007 on that so no other
worlds he basically request access ESPN

130
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,340
which represent that service

131
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:12,330
when you need something if you have
SharePoint you ought to request access

132
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:23,649
the web and SharePoint uses it and
back-end data base actually need to rest

133
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,570
access to that data base also so we have
a lot of expanding the network and all

134
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:36,928
of those bands are adjusted the Active
Directory and there is a discoverable

135
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:47,690
using built-in Microsoft tools so how
she actually how it walks like a duck

136
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,820
it's a request so the domain controller
with the issue

137
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:04,929
DDS for that service which will be
stopped using a secret only known by the

138
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:11,299
other hand the survey so when they use
their get this ticket you cannot read

139
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:18,299
our temper and when troopers that dates
to the sheriff the 17 decrypted using

140
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:25,629
secret and other ideas are based on
information so that secretly I'm talking

141
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,940
about is actually the service account
password hash

142
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:39,779
so when you join a computer to didn't
make it to the rates and that span

143
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,990
do dat machine when you use when you and
your Microsoft SQL instance when cells

144
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:53,049
it will also create a deeply and that's
been using the domain of me running on

145
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:55,650
the enemy so

146
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:05,140
basically most diplomatic me so don't
need to bother about and and even you

147
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:12,680
get this SQL in 2010 with being the
directory so you actually can still

148
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,460
request tickets to debt service even if
it's not available anymore so you may

149
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:30,220
have to spend another night another
interesting point is that the same

150
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:38,900
account can be used with can be used by
many as bands they can be different and

151
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:49,670
service type on a different machine so
much on said most of this will be

152
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:57,780
created using computer accounts but some
will be using user accounts

153
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,750
this is why you

154
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:10,980
just use it and we defined here web
server running on a server newly defined

155
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:18,250
account that it's going to be right and
what's interesting about this that those

156
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:26,050
in there are configured user else
they're both be different than those

157
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,050
configure with computer accounts so what

158
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:41,750
well first themselves they are creating
issue you are not right because just

159
00:21:41,750 --> 00:22:01,840
work on our set yet but you can for
example we use web server that there's a

160
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,490
ticket with anyone or is that a managed
it to me this is the same

161
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:22,530
network and potentially multiple
services machine ok so if one is

162
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:27,290
compromised it is possible as well

163
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:38,469
the possible the possible result is
different and they usually we know that

164
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:42,260
very often never expire

165
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:50,750
bestows it was also processes going out
it's the same weapons or a chance for

166
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:58,520
incoming connection at their usual
configured to use NTLM said he chose the

167
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:12,720
stronger houses and killing not sold for
which tension right so you can so that

168
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:21,190
that's also does and yes 128 aureus
which means that it is potentially

169
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:29,760
correctable the special this week

170
00:23:31,110 --> 00:24:03,418
like you know he went to you why has
your back will control

171
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,810
ok so is the password is anything we can
crack and break it and this is what we

172
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:22,820
are going to demonstrate for this like
to thank for his work on care brands

173
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,800
that makes time to be

174
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:48,129
and which will be available on request
the camera speak at a given show what we

175
00:24:48,130 --> 00:25:29,740
can do it so that stuff earlier ok so I
can see you now have a web service under

176
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:35,600
the user account and the ticket is
encrypted using out so far

177
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:47,959
your belly they did their part of the
ticket so basically said that the ticket

178
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:55,400
encrypted using the secret that using
the service account but perhaps that

179
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:05,720
person has their own account so when I
have to take it to do know what the trip

180
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,630
so two weeks ago has cats claims

181
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:16,440
threat to the new dashboard which is
able to crack

182
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:27,230
basically what it does generate and try
it succeed we know what the right secret

183
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:45,830
so we don't want to waste her time so we
take this ticket using hashtag is the

184
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:52,610
proof has got using a standard graphics
card will take about 10 hours

185
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:59,889
track seven it's an american muscle
which is the Windows domain name policy

186
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:26,860
so here it is possible that serbia

187
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:37,860
user account and begin with access to
network resources and use whatever

188
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:48,820
privileges are granted service account
for a 2007 it ok we can also go ahead

189
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,610
and earlier

190
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:58,879
burrows there is a component

191
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:12,350
whereas privileges the group members are
described and one does and so we have

192
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:22,320
that secret bus which dropped her own
tickets that's possible for us to the

193
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:33,179
attention she saw the silver ticket as
possible of you heard about the grant us

194
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:44,320
during this is dead and there are some
other stuff and all our work they hoping

195
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:51,980
the next few months will be able to stop
let's try to see all the way they got

196
00:28:51,980 --> 00:29:01,700
there so users connects machines on the
network and haven't corrected sessions

197
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:08,610
service automatic process when they
connected machines on the network

198
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:18,510
credentials as dr. compromises can still
more we have certain themself prudential

199
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,060
so off the machine from which the
automated process connects our

200
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:28,669
credentials such as a credentials USD
the breach

201
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,360
embedded in it creates

202
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:47,439
also showed earlier which have embedded
in them in the west of services and

203
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,740
their possible potential so it's mainly
a question of whether that doctors they

204
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:01,940
gobble those services that are configure
with user accounts potentially

205
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,060
PlayStation enforce that we have a
license

206
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:40,080
so we can try but I decided line takes
time

207
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:57,340
right so did the Magic Goes its find all
the sensitive groups and then find all

208
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:05,980
the user accounts then it takes all that
jazz bands and fight which under

209
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:11,650
services that are running jackets are
available and then we have a map and we

210
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:23,200
have a table show all the accounts and
their property so here it s ok so this

211
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:42,299
trip ticket they never saw all of them
are member of some kind

212
00:31:44,460 --> 00:32:04,510
and running he's done says SQL Server on
different that so in other words we're

213
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:14,590
now against a possible that we can
encrypt it and make them very

214
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:36,679
interesting ok so now you can find all
those that are indeed what can you do

215
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:43,310
about the about the surface created that
sucks are frustrated by some accounts

216
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:58,230
first of all disabled accounts very
basic and that is often overlooked so

217
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,880
just look at them they make sure that
you don't have anything that you don't

218
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,240
need you should avoid

219
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,630
counts are those that are used by both
human users and search and there

220
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:27,420
shouldn't be any network and issued an
actual you should change

221
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:44,920
rich and then there are 44 at the
Olympics and she is a privilege approach

222
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:56,030
in this specific case which into the
local services are running we

223
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,880
privileges are with the domain accounts
when they could just fly with local

224
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,429
accounts and there is also a counselor
chill accounts or accounts that are low

225
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:20,790
in whenever network resources that will
of the machine

226
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:43,150
you should also managed accounts and
enforce their rates and you should

227
00:34:43,150 --> 00:35:57,950
definitely special privileges and if you
are monitoring your network this is one

228
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,549
theory now

229
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:09,030
sure many of you have heard about it
they're dealing with building file and

230
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,510
detecting anomalies

231
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:20,730
against those files so very looking so
what our research shows that they're

232
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,850
they're somewhat

233
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:32,009
to use analytics and also double check
when you are using two accounts both

234
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:38,410
baby and by an automated process the
profile becomes very problematic there

235
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:50,790
r challenging so the whole thing up
until now in general are prevalent in

236
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,869
our networks both use to connect to
other resources

237
00:36:54,869 --> 00:37:04,800
ultimate process incoming connections
they are often overlooked and you need

238
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:13,750
to know where they are and what their
problems are you can use our or our out

239
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:22,359
whatever you want but the screen

240
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:34,550
yes you are and should many this is the
most important part if you don't you're

241
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:48,720
not aware they so with that will just
give us thanks to jim Kerr Bros inspire

242
00:37:48,720 --> 00:38:01,899
our scripts or group reported break-in
functionality to our customers data on

243
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:08,829
their networks and to our colleagues at
sidebar and participate in this research

244
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:16,500
groups will be available so they are the
research is available as well

245
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:32,259
and move ahead a few questions

246
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:42,010
great thank you very much three boats
and
