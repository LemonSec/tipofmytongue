1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:16,240
everybody last talked of the day despite
a minor and here we are clearing out a

2
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,869
year after this last talked so just a
heads up again once I want to thank our

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,800
sponsors you have any feedback about the
conference are batting intercessions

4
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,190
contests / feedback from commerce
feedback are on schedule on the

5
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:40,879
recession and click the feedback survey
but we have one less traveled to do

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,710
we're gonna do that immediately after
this and besides that I think that's it

7
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:55,340
when I welcome the guys from intermedia
we have Ryan we have and they're gonna

8
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:02,410
talk about employee hijacking building a
hat over awareness program thank you

9
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:08,690
ok times click something moves fast so
this is the team says Mr Della Reese

10
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:16,140
turn it on and I'm Ryan and masako yet
so first let us work out some

11
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,710
semi-trailer media about a hundred
employees has given the size of the

12
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,669
company

13
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,020
six corporate offices in three countries
and do much a cloud stuff which this

14
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:32,149
caller is a kind of obscuring but I will
talk about what I'm out why we did it

15
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,080
when it is a review of some of that and
campaigns and we ran against our

16
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,560
employees in the feedback and lessons
learned that we had and advise her for

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,060
getting started

18
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,600
you know I look at our top friends you
know the easy stuff as the network

19
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,320
application stuff it's easier than
employee and I think we know that for a

20
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,758
while and so securing the human and the
whole sands peace sparked my interest in

21
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,780
turn driving my security program hoard I
think the guys at this point about five

22
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,630
years ago started a program that will
inspire me when I read all the articles

23
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:17,500
about what they described myself so
those of you have heard that the goal is

24
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:25,010
kind of like I liken it to your
employees are like teenagers they don't

25
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:30,630
know how to drive a car or a monster
track when it down the song me patenting

26
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,459
let him crash early safely into the
barriers and learn the consequences

27
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,840
environment what it's like to handle
additional information safely make

28
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,830
mistakes in a way that the company and
screen name is in place so safe learning

29
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,180
fun engaging as much as they could be
tried to you

30
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,299
architects the lessons directly in the
campaigns in a way that was automated so

31
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:58,170
they will be much more scalable they can
just learn what they did wrong

32
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,170
immediately move on that and have to
come and meet with him

33
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,500
rules are pretty simple I sent an email
to six weeks ahead of time before the

34
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,700
campaign starts I say hey don't have
your colleagues when the ones doing the

35
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:18,089
hacking reports filed an axis security
and enterprise alright so what we do we

36
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,650
did in campaigns we need some fishing
campaigns which her know everybody's

37
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,010
pretty much right now

38
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,030
room wireless access points social
engineering on our support staff when it

39
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,959
puzzles was ETFs to engage employees and
let them get involved in other ways we

40
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,180
tried to USB keys and we did tell
getting from the school's alright so

41
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,040
fighting fish gelatin talking about
building the program the goal was

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,310
employed tons the email and they have to
differentiate between the lines of her

43
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,430
crap and the ones that have nowhere and

44
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,329
or trying to get a chance for money or
just so the goal was to create enticing

45
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:07,519
males mission as hard as he could sort
of step back and profit and hopefully

46
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,030
declined so Dylan Walsh walkthrough like
how we actually built that what that

47
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:25,940
looks like a great thanks fishing your
employees on this important is to make

48
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,690
sure that you have your campaigns
targeted towards things that your users

49
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,310
are you saying in their mailboxes on
day-to-day basis to make sure that the

50
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:43,639
phishing websites that you're sending it
to our created very well you wanna make

51
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,460
sure that you have this database of
metadata that you can pull from to treat

52
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,989
these emails and of course he Dakota
mailer

53
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:58,979
cassini's manual that you have a good
clear lesson of why you're doing this to

54
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:05,419
employ so they don't feel shamed yeah
absolutely going to want to monitor this

55
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:08,630
and also gonna want to report on it

56
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,770
layoffs right now I'm kidding

57
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,530
absolutely important to plan this
campaign's you want to make sure that

58
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,049
everything is ready to go and it's very
important like what is you can like I

59
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,050
said earlier you want to make sure that
it's targeted for things that your

60
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,970
employees are going to see every day so
for us first things people love free

61
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:39,770
stuff so we sent them some Amazon gift
cards for being the best employees in

62
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,359
our database and I'll talk about it a
little bit we actually since this is

63
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,580
emails from their managers

64
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,430
so they thought they were special these
actually collect credentials like the

65
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:59,270
other campaigns we did these are
actually drive-by downloads and so if

66
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:04,938
they click through they would receive a
nice chat if downloaded to their system

67
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:10,400
and we could track that some blogs and
things that we had collecting

68
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:20,539
Amazon goes on for overseas the creds
traditional collecting emails we sent

69
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:27,650
our payroll system and also for our
Dropbox like product called secure see

70
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:34,580
so first off with a payroll system
creates people want to get paid so if

71
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,609
you tell them that they need to update
their information in the payroll system

72
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,529
or they're not getting their gonna click
the link

73
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:45,199
they're gonna they're gonna give the
crowds and you can tell a lot about that

74
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:53,690
for the file sharing your manager
accidentally just shared all the salary

75
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,099
information with you this confidential
folder click here in a conventional to

76
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:06,990
the web page and yeah I'll so kind of
the bits and pieces you absolutely want

77
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,139
to make sure you have an exact duplicate
of the website

78
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,430
your users will notice a broken image
things aren't working correctly

79
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:19,900
especially they visit the site on a
daily basis absolutely you know what to

80
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,179
get domains that are registered as close
as possible as you can see the real

81
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:32,460
domain at the website has a cell I had
SSL cert by bucks at Namecheap as a tip

82
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:41,008
don't collect the passwords do single
database and just a touch all the

83
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:46,900
databases us populating email messages
these are some bits and pieces every

84
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,469
kind of came up with for filtering you
know we use department office location

85
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:59,390
we kind of just these tables in in
sequel and and you know used for the

86
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,990
emails to populate variables there at
their first and last name so you need to

87
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,910
figure that out like what's going to be
relevant for your campaigns in the

88
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:15,760
database unique identifier very
important for reporting and tracking to

89
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,890
build this I used PHP

90
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:27,610
judge so again to populate your email
templates the info database and automate

91
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,580
this as much as possible

92
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:35,699
the unique identifier will allow you to
track and report utilizes we utilizing

93
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,560
spunk and also pulling in the Apache
logs be able to take this unique

94
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:44,500
identifier that we attach the URLs in
the phishing emails and kind of create

95
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,980
little pretty dashboards and slunk off
of that and see who clicked what

96
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:54,630
correlate that and see who needs a
talking to you absolutely want to test

97
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,339
this don't fuck it up

98
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:02,950
needed tested I sent emails all night
several times

99
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,650
testing it out to make sure it works can
get one shot just a touch on these less

100
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:13,100
bits here this is a lesson page this was
for a payroll campaign this is what we

101
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,400
create create this urgency you need to
click this and give us your credentials

102
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,170
now and teach them a lesson

103
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,810
basically telling them what they should
I look for in these email messages

104
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,989
before actually providing threads lastly
this was our front page this was a real

105
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,100
time monitoring we can watch people's
credit came in in real time and yeah

106
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,380
this is for our eyes only nobody else
office but you know we did a lot of

107
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,350
hacked over that of a lousy but yeah
that's that a man had this back to Ryan

108
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,270
now talk about the statistics that Mike

109
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:58,110
it's really hard to read I get that but
this is awesome we just sit back and

110
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,399
watch the candy role in users clicking
and giving us their passwords and it was

111
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:10,579
ridiculous I mean not just like Jane
finance and Joe marketing it was like it

112
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:13,579
was like senior engineers who should
know better

113
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:23,649
my password crazy ok so here's the
statistics here and three different

114
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:31,589
campaigns and call the campaign is like
like that one of the emails payroll

115
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:36,939
would be a campaign offices so the first
one is jealous mansion which we went

116
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:43,550
small and just like his work you know
the database so the first one out and

117
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,319
this is bad

118
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:54,319
66% clicked on the link 44% games and
password that's horrible heroes 700

119
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:59,370
emails that's almost the whole company
dropped precipitously then gift cards

120
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:06,589
you get a share every couple weeks I
start learning and I mean I see like I

121
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:12,089
didn't get me a great amount of support
staff is awesome taxi policy

122
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,109
flash drives that's fine that's actually
a senior director company pick that up

123
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,079
but he didn't like it in santa brought
us straight over I bring my spring

124
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,859
rounds in the entrances to buildings and
hang out of the conference on my phone

125
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:36,490
and just wait and see who picked him up
and he didn't like it and he brought it

126
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:42,939
straight over to us and said hey found
this october surprise us something he

127
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:46,420
feels good he did the right thing and

128
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:53,229
not gonna tell us a little about get
there I'll get there so they watch is

129
00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:01,339
dumb USB drives we actually like really
thought about this long to see them with

130
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:07,010
what documents will be really like no
salary survey things like that and they

131
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:14,220
would make outbound connections back to
our thing is really tough to read but

132
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:20,339
especially the document a pop-up say hi
protection because of gibberish and

133
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:28,089
macros and when you popped up and said
like here's the lesson you know you

134
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:34,470
screwed up this is a common method this
is a list of documents that we created

135
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:42,089
tyson found they are all laced with code
to to phone home back to us and give us

136
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:47,000
a little bit of data on who they were so
this goes back to spawn tell us you know

137
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,949
which document opens the time that works
engine name their IP address

138
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:55,329
they're scared but they plugged in and
we can tell the difference between if

139
00:12:55,329 --> 00:13:02,750
they wanted in or if they played in open
document and enable macros so each step

140
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,750
was really is nowhere to hide

141
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:43,439
talk to us about access my program is
not a few like Debian and then so as

142
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,279
long as commission also be amazing

143
00:13:51,950 --> 00:14:09,690
out when someone brings it back in the
design of the woods so each office gets

144
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:19,300
its own once they're plugged in the
airport on these are brought us and we

145
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,199
have a single come on board was on the
internet it's like one another

146
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:34,189
connections from these are so you can
share information like western Arctic do

147
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,860
I bought what is going on

148
00:14:36,860 --> 00:15:00,150
information that you know this new
program or even the next 20 minutes and

149
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:10,319
this also 2011 does what does it look
like someone CDs boat's supposed to be

150
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:20,960
an information message in addition to
this audience just to just so if someone

151
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,480
in the office annex 2 D's sports by
misty

152
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,880
there's also a vision that something's
going on here is a message that they

153
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,830
also see what information do we collect

154
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:49,620
once we have aggregated information on
views so once the slogan goes into the

155
00:15:49,620 --> 00:16:01,870
list of devices have this in front of
you all so much fun for someone who

156
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:11,530
wants to find out the general use
violence against an inspired vision so

157
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:19,930
it makes it harder on information lake
at any point in time and location

158
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:30,199
location and what are the wireless part
of me does that change this as a single

159
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:43,740
see what's happening and this is in
addition to all of this the board also

160
00:16:43,740 --> 00:17:00,700
has a delay on the landing beach we have
a message for someone who does he have a

161
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:10,670
hidden message that you can see in the
highlighted alerted someone is supposed

162
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:21,110
to go to the beach which then leads to
another and it gives them a hand on what

163
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:30,820
to do next in this case it's the first
five numbers and unsafe practices when

164
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:38,879
anyone cracks me also get notified by a
skunk that the morning demon

165
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:54,250
and once we have this next meeting this
afternoon when I will say about that the

166
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,940
rogue AP thing that was hidden benefit
which was cool was it helped us detect a

167
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,900
whole bunch of Intel wireless adapters
or misconfigured in points that were

168
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,770
considered to automatically connected to
open a tease and so we just start seeing

169
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:14,060
all these victims rolling in and this is
what is going on with this and the same

170
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:19,860
people over and over again so she had no
benefit to getting so how is one thing

171
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,760
we decide to try and have a stranger
guests come in

172
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,730
actually the son of one of our places
along with us I brought in this

173
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,670
eighteen-year-old sign in boxes and just
told us are going around a different

174
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:38,740
book tours in the buildings and just
trying to join a class I'm here he got

175
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:45,830
in all the time it was not good so that
was I think our biggest week that was

176
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,760
some of the post has a month is really
quick so this is actually one of the

177
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,850
posters that we created and ships out
all the offices and so these showed up

178
00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:05,570
mysteriously around October in you could
read on the market and people and clues

179
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:11,179
on how did you know something there and
there are some people are so paranoid

180
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:17,190
about hacking them that the markets
there's only on my phone now I'm not

181
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,190
even a little bit together

182
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:31,240
what was once you could you put together
your wiki p.m. 39 and NFC tags look for

183
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,030
that we had in its attacks on the back
of the puzzles so there are some other

184
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:42,610
stuff to find their bottom line is
alleged to decode the password and login

185
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:47,080
and they gave you a code that which if
you presented it to you got your prize

186
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,560
so people loved it

187
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,340
the prices are great people of schwag
month stickers privacy guards disliked

188
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,530
elevate themselves among sorry fellow
employees and say hey look I got to

189
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:04,170
happen and that's cool I mean security
awareness is not like a cool topic that

190
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:11,070
that employees generally think about as
something fun and so we saw this whole

191
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,970
different conversation starting to
happen around the offices which has

192
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,610
people excited about what was going to
happen

193
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:23,629
gonna be this year how can I win a prize
I hope I get one this year so that was

194
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,740
something that was a discourse is a win

195
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,390
talking about oh I hope I don't get fish
this year how did you catch that

196
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,880
phishing attack last time that kind of
conversation never happens that when you

197
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,500
do a CBT base security awareness
campaign it it just doesn't so that kind

198
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,380
of stuff was a huge sum of feedback was
just loved it was cool

199
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:54,440
learn stuff didn't others became experts
other people got pissed off thats ok

200
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:03,010
most people are looking for you better
start earlier there's anything I did you

201
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,140
start early

202
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:10,700
the 60 a little bit of time but just try
to make it perfect this is going to be a

203
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,610
third-year doing it and

204
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:22,600
where r us were working on our work now
we're all our stuff October as you saw

205
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,669
the declining arrow Lake touching the
Bella 323 campaigns in a month so we

206
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:33,270
told ourselves we may start to see you
guys every quarter and just randomly

207
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:37,639
with all kinds of crappy campaigns that
they would know when and where would

208
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,950
come from that would just kind of keep
them on their toes and paranoid

209
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,910
throughout the whole year and said just
once a year in office

210
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:52,679
difficult time we didn't have given him
passengers and people need help us set

211
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,130
up the pies and take delivery in hand
out prizes like that so clear

212
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:04,760
instructions have been much more helpful
so wrapping up start early check

213
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,049
management gets support a very small
budget gets you going

214
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:15,980
notifying employees of victims victims
now six weeks out and just gets its good

215
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,169
times we had

216
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:26,010
benefits that temperature finger on it
unless you do so thanks we're hiring

217
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:45,440
does generate a lot of great material
for this company that we could publish

218
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,160
all these wireless cracks and right and
you can get that question we're still

219
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,240
thinking about it I'm still running it
past the lawyer and as he says yes I

220
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:11,230
think it's alright other questions you
have any statistics

221
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,899
how the employees their security
awareness over two years of October's

222
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:22,008
will definitely have the fishing
statistics I think we only have one year

223
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:28,759
that and we did all the data going back
in this really helps bring out the

224
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,509
entire user database import it into a
separate databases we know the first

225
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:36,070
name last name the manager there title
that really helps drive

226
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,889
districts around like you know who
clicked on Wed and allowed us to fish

227
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:47,529
them directly from their managers that
was awesome that is my best so far in

228
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:51,489
the first year we did it we just
horribly and so it really didn't bother

229
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:56,450
keeping statistics to just see if we
could do it and if they didn't fire

230
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:01,759
assay melee fracking everybody I think
this year we're gonna keep much better

231
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:18,600
statistics I mean obviously jeans over
the years but still number one thing

232
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:25,389
they want to his place if the younger
generations like what's that the first

233
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:31,189
year we did it we did see Iran's and
USBs like sprinkles here on the office

234
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:37,789
of confidential and people like what's a
CD rom CT leader thing on my rainbow

235
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:40,789
desk

236
00:24:47,490 --> 00:25:01,540
twice making us feel free to email us if
you have questions thank you so much and

237
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,620
again on behalf of security b-sides and
thanks to our sponsors
