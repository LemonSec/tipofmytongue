1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,570
very broad scope very deep very manual
technique oriented and very narrow so

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,879
we're not looking to get complete
coverage across an environment but more

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,000
looking to see how deep can we go
without detection

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,189
objectives here for a red team exercise
are different depending on if you're

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,269
looking at it from the red team
perspective or from the client prospect

6
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:32,140
on the red team site were looking to
accurately simulate an attack by a

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,920
sophisticated adversary and adversaries
seeking to achieve what the business

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,760
considers to be a nightmare scenario and
they're looking to do that without

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,460
detection their end-game may involve
something that's obviously going to be

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,890
detected eventually such as I loss of
money

11
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,039
shutting down systems ramp somewhere
whatever it may be that they're looking

12
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,680
to get to that point without detection
so that they can move into their

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,800
end-game on the client site you're
looking to understand their resiliency

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,570
to the style of an attack and at the end
of the day what they're really looking

15
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:13,380
to do is drive risk reduction so they're
not interested in specific technical

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,679
vulnerabilities or attack techniques
except insofar as it helps them to

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,420
reduce their overall risk to this style
of an attack so this presentation is not

18
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,470
focused on the technical aspects the
technical techniques that go into a red

19
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,619
team exercise but rather how do we plan
for success how do we make sure that

20
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:41,150
we've done all of the right planning
ahead of time so that we can set up this

21
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,369
exercise from the very beginning to have
the best chance of being successful as

22
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:51,759
defined by both the red team members and
those on the client security team

23
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,020
so few key principles here the first is
hyper realism which means that in order

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,220
to evaluate their resiliency to attack
we have to actually attack have to

25
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,360
attack them in the most realistic way
possible

26
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,209
obviously the corollary to that is we're
not going to take the final step of

27
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,690
actually causing harm to the business so
hyper realism well doing no harm this

28
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,030
means we get to the point where we could
push the button to cause some form of

29
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,060
destruction some form of damage to the
business but we don't actually do it we

30
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,230
don't actually steal the money or
disable the brakes on a mine shaft

31
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:39,440
elevator or whatever the case may be as
we go along dirt dirt to other

32
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,480
principals europe zero knowledge in 0
notice are going to those more in detail

33
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,760
later but essentially that zero
knowledge refers to the secure the red

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,609
team's perspective on this engagement
they have zero knowledge about the

35
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,820
environment that they're attacking about
where the assets are that they're

36
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,790
looking to compromise about the security
controls are in place there are

37
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,269
centrally given here is your target here
is the objective that you're looking to

38
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:14,480
achieve zero notice is the other side of
that coin it refers to the security

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,130
operations team and their knowledge of
the assessment they received 0 notice

40
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,820
that this attack simulation is going to
occur as far as they know this is a real

41
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,709
attack

42
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,850
there's a real adversary out there and
until the end of the engagement they are

43
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,690
kept in the dark about the fact that
this is an authorized legitimate attack

44
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,549
against their environment and this feeds
back into the hyper realism if we don't

45
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:45,290
have zero knowledge and 20 notice
components we lose a lot of the realism

46
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:53,090
so number of key considerations that go
into planning this style a technical

47
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,970
assessment

48
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,210
walk through each of these in more
detail purchase at a high level here

49
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,790
we'll look at the scenario we'll look at
how we design a campaign plan to achieve

50
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,120
those objectives the scope of the
assessment what types of attacks to

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,950
include the rules of engagement how do
we conduct ourselves as a professional

52
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,570
adversary simulator during the
engagement and what's the overall mode

53
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,950
of communication with the client and
what's the escalation plan that we put

54
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:30,300
in place for the various contingencies
that we need to account for starting off

55
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,510
with the add the adversary scenario here
the first principles that were keeping

56
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:43,880
this at a business level this means that
we are not looking to have a a scenario

57
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:51,430
objective compromise a domain
administrator account from the CEO at

58
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,830
that the CFO's perspective they likely
don't know work here what a domain

59
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,560
administrator is we're looking for
something dead they will understand and

60
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,230
this is going to vary from industry to
industry and from client to client

61
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:11,160
within that industry so we want to
define who would be interested in

62
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,990
attacking this business

63
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,960
the adversary interested in compromising
a web hosting company is going to be

64
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,440
very different from the adversary
seeking to undermine a gold mining

65
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,900
company both of those would be different
from the adversary is primarily

66
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,219
interested in targeting a financial
institution so first who is going to

67
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:39,270
attack this particular company disclose
follow-on is why what is their

68
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:46,690
motivation and this this is going to
vary depending on the adversary and

69
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,930
depending on the client as well so it
may be straight up financial motivation

70
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,280
it may be the dairies

71
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,489
a political component either a nation
state sponsored adversary or a

72
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:06,740
hacktivist group it may be a less
sophisticated attacker that is simply

73
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,940
doing this for the grill or to make a
statement or bragging rights but it's

74
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,510
important to understand why because that
defines what a realistic attack is going

75
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,909
to look like realistic compared to what
what is the adversary that this client

76
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,270
should be most concerned about what
would the impact to the client if this

77
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,609
adversary were successful in their
attack at the achieve their intent what

78
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,280
would the impact to the client and what
is the adversaries

79
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,970
objective now only after we've answered
those first three questions we start to

80
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,990
look at a more specific level and again
this is not a technical objective but a

81
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:54,560
business objective what is the the type
of data or the type of system that

82
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,800
they're looking to compromise so not can
I get on database server 231 but can I

83
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,240
access plaintext cardholder information
in any form from any system anywhere in

84
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,860
the enterprise the adversary doesn't
care much where it comes from in so you

85
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,940
lose realism if you define it too
narrowly finally what's the starting

86
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:25,580
point for this type of an assessment are
we looking at an insider threat where

87
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,840
the the adversary already has access to
the internal network on some level of

88
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,909
credentials are we looking at an
external adversary first needs to reach

89
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,350
the perimeter setup that foothold on the
internal network and then become an

90
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,830
insider threats so to speak

91
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:49,440
so it's different client concerns you go
through that the client concerns and

92
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,050
some items that were trying to avoid
here or via the adversary scenario the

93
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,670
concerns are usually around these two
items first

94
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:02,840
well i i need to check the boxes is a
regulation there's a client on my

95
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,719
management had told me that I need to do
an external tests in internal test test

96
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,570
this application and a wireless
assessment our response is usually

97
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,260
that's will do that but don't limit
yourself to that instead wrap all of

98
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,380
those specific attack techniques into
the context of a broader adversary

99
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,540
simulation so that you can get the
benefits of that broader assessment

100
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:32,159
while still checking the boxes in
keeping the regulators happy another one

101
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,159
is simply that they don't see themselves
as a target for this style of attack and

102
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,900
regardless of what industry there in
this is a process of walking them

103
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,530
through who would be interested in
attacking that industry because even if

104
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,780
they don't feel that their target for
that attack as we've seen more and more

105
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,370
from the high-profile breaches they may
be a target for they need the Home Depot

106
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,260
where they may be any other type of
entity that has something of value to

107
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:09,010
the adversary we want to avoid defining
only those I T objectives and we want to

108
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,550
avoid dilution about this means I'm an
adversary coming back to us and saying

109
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,410
well I got these half dozen different
objectives I want you to achieve the

110
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,290
problem is if you're doing say a
six-week engagement and you have six

111
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,800
different objectives you're going to be
simulating six different adversaries are

112
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,130
only willing to spend a week each
attacking the enterprise

113
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:38,379
what's more deadly and what we urge our
clients to consider is more focus on the

114
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,749
one adversary that matters the most

115
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:45,600
who's willing to devote six weeks about
focus on that one assessment and maybe

116
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,429
consider others down the road so once
the adversaries scenario has been

117
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:57,209
defined an agreed-upon next you move
into the campaign plan to achieve the

118
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:00,949
objectives and night I know this is an
election year but we're not talking

119
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:06,079
about a plan to get elected here it's an
attack campaign the offensive campaign

120
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,209
key principles on this one first be
creative

121
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:19,018
anything that the adversary can do
should be in scope here it's the

122
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,589
adversary can attack from the internet
you include that in scope it the

123
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,290
adversary consent to malicious email
that's included can I pick up the phone

124
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:34,339
and call an employee yes can they
identified some dirt on an employee and

125
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:39,699
use that to coerce them yes but there we
run into the question legality and

126
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:44,299
ethics are obviously lines that we as an
adversary or as a simulated adversary

127
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:49,329
can't cross but what you can do is
simulated those have been effective so

128
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:53,519
for example we've gone through
engagements where we've identified given

129
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,809
individuals reached out to the clients
and said this individual has information

130
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:05,049
out on LinkedIn that identifies them as
a likely target based on other sources

131
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:09,889
we've identified that this individual
might be susceptible not questioning

132
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:14,989
their ethics in any form of simply there
are some leverage points that may be

133
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:19,600
available till we reach out to the
client and say let's let simulate that

134
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,319
this had occurred not with this
particular employee but with someone in

135
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:28,799
this role within the organization if
that person decided to turn against you

136
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:35,108
how effective would they be operating in
conjunction with an external adversaries

137
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:38,859
so if they provide everything that they
know everything that they have access to

138
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:41,580
to the adversary

139
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,200
how much easier would it be for the
adversary to bring down the organization

140
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,880
at that point the adaptive this means
that we don't have a single attack

141
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,750
pathway in mind when we first started
out in the engagement in that six-week

142
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,080
engagement I mentioned we don't know

143
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,070
in week 4 said we don't know when we won
what we're going to be doing in week 4

144
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,800
we let it evolve organically we know
what attack techniques we have at our

145
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,449
disposal and we know how we're going to
adapt as we move along but we let it

146
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:20,150
evolve organically and adapt to the
conditions on the ground so to speak

147
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,010
again

148
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,700
hyper realism the adversaries going to
adapt the adversaries not going to say

149
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:30,220
well there's a larger attack surface
over here but we also need to make sure

150
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,350
that we do this wireless test so we're
going to stop this fruitful attack in

151
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,700
order to move over to this area that
doesn't make sense it's not realistic so

152
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,060
instead let the red team all of their
nose so to speak and a just where

153
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:50,569
they're going to spend their time based
on the available attack surface finally

154
00:12:50,570 --> 00:13:00,160
be resilient in conjunction with your
notice principle this means that the

155
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,420
blue team the security operations team
defending against the simulated attack

156
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:13,120
is going to be countering your efforts
so make sure that your attack takes that

157
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,220
into an into account if for example we
have three different attack techniques

158
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:26,770
external network physical on-site 5
compromise implanting a device on the

159
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:32,160
network and social engineering fishing
plan for some of these to fail

160
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,860
plan for some of them to be detected and
ensured that there is no infrastructure

161
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,120
shared between those different
techniques so that if two out of three

162
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,340
are detected and eradicated you still
have that third from the the response

163
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,570
perspective if you remove two-thirds of
an adversaries access to the environment

164
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:59,690
you feel so we want to ensure that we
have the ability to retain that third

165
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:06,180
motive access so clang concerns first
simply I don't think I can approve a

166
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,760
physical breach or calling an employee
or any of these other things that

167
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,610
usually says that you're too far down in
the organization you're not discussing

168
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,010
the assessment at a sufficiently high
executive level in order for them to

169
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,689
understand the risk-reward tradeoff
these engagements are never without risk

170
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:33,150
to the organization there's always the
chance that something could go wrong we

171
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,360
manage that when we get into the the
rules of engagement later but you have

172
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,700
to have someone who's willing to take on
a certain amount of risk in order to

173
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:47,120
reap the reward doing an adversary
simulation second we know someone will

174
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,680
click that this is in regards to the
social engineering the spear phishing

175
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,770
components this is usually an indicator
that they're not thinking of the type of

176
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:03,750
fishing assessment that we would include
an adversary simulation we're not

177
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,640
looking to send out a thousand messages
and see who clicks the link because

178
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,819
that's very noisy raises the profile and
is almost certainly going to be noticed

179
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:20,290
in blocks by the blue team what we're
looking at is and exactly the right

180
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:27,550
email and we send it to one or two
people and they click the link for the

181
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,530
technical controls in place to respond
effectively workers to detect that

182
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,930
that's occurred and to respond
effectively and are the procedural

183
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:42,510
controls in place in order to quickly
take a system offline understand the

184
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:47,350
indicators of compromise understand
where else that same foothold might be

185
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,560
in the environment and so on so we're
not looking at will someone clicked the

186
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,939
link or not we know there's always
someone who's going to click link we're

187
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,400
looking at the compensating controls at
a technical and procedural level with

188
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,400
the assumption that someone will click
the link

189
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:09,339
we want to avoid fragmented offensive
campaigns this means that we're not

190
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:14,420
looking at this as first an external
assessment then an internal assessment

191
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,189
than a spear phishing assessment data
wireless assessment it's one attack

192
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:23,498
campaign with different attack
techniques so as we move along it's

193
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:24,749
going to go

194
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:30,779
organically from one phase into the next
if we're doing the external assessment

195
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:36,949
and we're expecting to spend some amount
of time on this and a fourth of the way

196
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:41,189
through the anticipated time we get
access to a server and we realize that

197
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:44,849
this server has access to the internal
environment were immediately

198
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,949
transitioning to an internal assessment
it's all part of the same attack

199
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:56,628
campaign and we want to avoid overly
specific we've had times where more

200
00:16:56,629 --> 00:17:03,410
regulated clients or or clients who are
extremely risk adverse wants us to

201
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,059
document exactly what our attack plan is
on this day we're going to be trying

202
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:11,260
these types of attacks on that day were
going to be trying these types of

203
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,949
attacks we can't do that if that's what
the particular client wants that means

204
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:20,789
they're not really looking for an
adversary simulation because you lose a

205
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:29,090
large amount of the realism if your
plans are overly specific now looking at

206
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:37,840
the scope for the scope we want to think
globally and strike precisely thinking

207
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,980
globally means that we're looking at the
enterprise as a whole again

208
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,380
hyper realism if the adversary can
identify that you have a branch office

209
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,159
that you don't care much about compared
your corporate headquarters and the

210
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:56,409
security controls are weaker their
physical controls are weaker there and

211
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:01,649
it's possible to say nikoloc after hours
and plan something on the network is

212
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:04,649
completely legitimate process to include
that as well

213
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,929
once we plug something into the network
there then we can move laterally

214
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:11,789
identify which systems on the
headquarters network

215
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:16,369
are accessible from this branch office
in it through those deeper and deeper

216
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:17,649
into the environment

217
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:22,918
similarly we don't want the client to
say sure the 10 systems that I really

218
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,749
care about these Rd assets that contain
the data that you're trying to

219
00:18:26,749 --> 00:18:35,659
compromise limit your scope to these 95%
of the time those systems are well

220
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:41,019
secured because there are understood to
be high-value s attacking those head-on

221
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:47,190
is not going to work instead we're
looking for that forgotten development

222
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:53,440
server somewhere that was stood up on a
whim for testing and remains on the

223
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,470
network is not part of any assets
spreadsheet but is out there and is

224
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,190
vulnerable and maybe on the domain if we
compromise that we get a domain account

225
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,460
and our level of access no balls from
there as we escalate privileges and move

226
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:14,259
laterally across the enterprise
eventually we get to the point where we

227
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:20,169
have this very broad and deep level of
access we have access to domain

228
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:23,629
administrator accounts yes we target
them but that's not the end objective

229
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:30,399
may have access to a SSH keys that
provide access to a majority of the UNIX

230
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:35,908
environment whatever it needs once we
have this access then it's time to

231
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:41,389
strike precise and this means going
after the end objective going down to

232
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:47,658
the assets containing the data we care
about but then coming in as an

233
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:53,179
authorized users actually we have the
right credentials all we have to do is

234
00:19:53,179 --> 00:20:01,070
ask nicely and were granted access to
those systems plan concerns availability

235
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:06,700
is usually the largest if I give you
this authorization to attack any

236
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,509
component to my enterprise I'm not going
to know where you are attacking and I'm

237
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:17,299
not going to know what what concerns
those system owners may have about those

238
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,370
going offline

239
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:26,050
a response to that is usually if if we
can easily knock over a system through

240
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:31,950
our type very manual white clubs testing
the Nazi huge finding in and of itself

241
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,230
that really at the end of the day it
comes down to trust it comes down to

242
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:42,530
what is their level of confidence in
your team's ability to operate carefully

243
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:49,010
in this environment since so in order to
do these types of some of his game that

244
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,710
level of trust what we found is that it
really needs to be an all senior team of

245
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:59,890
technical experts who have a very robust
broad experience in offensive security

246
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,250
and no with a very high level of
confidence

247
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,200
what's going to happen at each step of
the way so that they can make that

248
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:13,120
risk-reward decision at each point along
the way knowing that if I go to this

249
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,020
next step I might get closer to the
objective but it might do something that

250
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:24,510
is going to affect system stability so I
need to go in another direction the

251
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,270
second concern is I don't actually own
like infrastructure in this is becoming

252
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,570
more and more common as we see
organizations move to cloud-based

253
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:38,059
systems so in some cases is easy to
address if you have a client with a

254
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:43,350
portion of their infrastructure hosted
in EWS are a sure any of those similar

255
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,149
environments there's a structured
process for getting authorization to

256
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:51,929
attack those systems on behalf of the
client so we can usually go through that

257
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:56,300
process get the authorization and
include that as part of the global scope

258
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:02,300
of the assessment sometimes there is a
hosting provider that just won't work

259
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,830
with you on that and in that case
there's really not much you can do other

260
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:12,939
than document that there is a whole lack
of visibility around this component what

261
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,490
the client

262
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,120
should be doing ahead of time is when
they're negotiating the agreements with

263
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,699
these vendors including ensuring that
they have the right to audit clause in

264
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:27,320
their contract so that when they comment
ask for the authorization to attack that

265
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,340
environment is really a formality the
vendor has already agreed to let them do

266
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,870
it they're just looking for specific
approval in this instance things we want

267
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,719
to avoid we want to avoid limiting the
engagement only the areas that the

268
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,130
client thinks are important so I
mentioned the example of these these are

269
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,510
the system that we care about we also
want to avoid letting them even

270
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:57,370
employees the assessment that much what
we prefer is to get access to the

271
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:03,159
internal environment find the knowledge
repositories wikis the SharePoint sites

272
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,059
and explore those on our own to find the
type find references to the type of data

273
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:12,970
we care about again this goes back to
the zero knowledge principal how easy is

274
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:20,530
it to find term interest in artifacts
account of that type of exploration such

275
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:25,280
as are their sites out there on your
internet that contain information

276
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,960
pointing to the critical data source is
that properly IRR their proper

277
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,520
authentication authorization controls
around that sometimes in an extreme

278
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,350
example we've even seen domain
administrator credentials on internal

279
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:46,159
SharePoint sites and does in the types
of things that we would have found if we

280
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,240
weren't operating from his euro
knowledge prospective needing to do that

281
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,350
level of discovery ourselves

282
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,320
we want to avoid whitelist seen only
certain subjects there will be times

283
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,010
when a client comes to us and says we
know these systems will fall over if you

284
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:07,500
touch them vote blacklist the difference
between saying this small set of systems

285
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:15,770
is out of scope and saying you can only
operate in this circle rules of

286
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:21,289
engagement or key principles here all of
which go back to that the hyper realism

287
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:28,669
first the Red Team autonomy we need to
allow the red team the agility to

288
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:34,020
operate in this manner as we've been
discussing this includes things like

289
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:40,030
having this 24 by 7 window understanding
that they will have access to sensitive

290
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:46,000
data but making sure that the proper
protocols are in place as to how they're

291
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,700
going to handle the sensitive data when
they gain access to a note on the 24 by

292
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,750
7 window yes this means operating in
your production environment during

293
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:03,190
business hours we've been on our clients
I Financial Systems of Record money

294
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,440
movement systems and so on during
business hours we've been on mine

295
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,929
operations systems well mine is actually
operating if an adversary could do that

296
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:23,000
so can we do it goes back to that
foundational principle this makes a lot

297
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,490
of clients very uneasy because it does
mean that we have access to everything

298
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:35,720
if they have mergers and acquisitions
data especially if that's part of the

299
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,830
data that's been defined as as a
component to be injected we will likely

300
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:49,250
have access to that we will likely have
access to their executives emails as we

301
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,380
go through and compromise workstations
will data mining everything that's on

302
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:59,299
those workstations if an employee has
good high sensitive information on that

303
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:01,650
works six they have personal photos on
there

304
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,650
we may well see those were operating as
an adversary there so it comes down to

305
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,980
the level of professionalism that they
expect from the red team and recognizing

306
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:20,350
that they are granting a very broad
level of authorization target them so

307
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,669
then how do you avoid creating
essentially a reportable incidents if

308
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:30,920
her accessing personal information
electronic personal health information

309
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,580
materially non-public information about
the company's financial performance

310
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,679
whatever it may be especially this all
goes back to having the right legal

311
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,930
agreements in place so I'm definitely
not a lawyer make sure that you have a

312
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,440
lawyer involved at this process there
are things that can be done to

313
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:55,480
officially granted authorization as a
business associate or other form of on

314
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,240
formal recognition of the role that your
plane so the client is authorizing you

315
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,330
to see this data as part of their
business operations even if they're not

316
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:12,409
traditionally new with access to that
data again we're we're avoiding any

317
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:18,800
unrealistic limitation could the
adversary attack you on Christmas when

318
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,669
they know that you're a team is likely
home with their families and you gotta

319
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:26,040
more junior crew on staff and fewer than
you normally would

320
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:32,060
yes the adversary could so yes we can do
that as well we'd actually had clients

321
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:37,840
explicitly ask us please attack us on
christmas because we want to know how we

322
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,459
hold up we want to know if we have
sufficient staffing and sufficient

323
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:49,410
skills in place so that we can I we can
defend against asylum attack even if we

324
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:55,450
are attacked on Christmas the last thing
you want to do is get stuck in when I

325
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,630
call specific pre-approval help this
means that as part of your rules of

326
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:06,360
engagement you are required to get
reauthorization for every exploit that

327
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,780
you conduct so you find a system on the
network you've identified a given

328
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,980
vulnerability

329
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,590
and you need to go back to the client to
ask me I exploit this vulnerability you

330
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:21,370
then exploit back and you see out I'm
running as system on this workstation

331
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:28,678
may i retrieve password hashes may I
complement managed to crack the password

332
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,929
hashes you can see very quickly that
this box you down

333
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:37,540
it means that you've lost a lot of the
realism simply because I you you've made

334
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:42,240
the whole process take ten times as long
as you go back and forth with the client

335
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,049
and they are then wondering can I
authorize do I need to ask somebody else

336
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:52,679
instead define an upfront define it
explicitly in your rules of engagement

337
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,929
that you are not going to be asking for
specific pre-approval but that you will

338
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:03,440
be compromising systems deployed
offensive technologies I cracking

339
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:10,040
passwords reusing compromised accounts
and any other specific tech attack

340
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,980
techniques you want to include their get
agreement on those and have notification

341
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:23,130
procedures in place but not pre-approval
required that gets into the

342
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:29,910
communication and escalation in this is
really around maintaining that 0 noticed

343
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,720
posture as regards the internal
Bluetooth the security operations team

344
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,830
first from the very beginning when you
are first discussing this type of

345
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:45,559
engagement ensure that the client knows
to keep this on a need to know basis

346
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:54,330
were usually I'm proposing this
assessment to the sea so for the CIO or

347
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:59,540
sometimes even the CEO or Board of
Directors depending on the level that is

348
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:05,320
concerned about their attack resiliency
from that first conversation we will

349
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:12,460
recommend that they only share knowledge
that they're even talking to us with the

350
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,049
minimum number of people who really need
to be in the loop here you can get the

351
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:22,580
blue team gets wind that there's going
to be this style of an attack you've

352
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:29,199
lost a lot of your realism the objective
is explicitly to keeps a cops in the

353
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,830
dark so they think this is a real attack
like any other real attack and they go

354
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:40,590
through their normal response procedures
so that we can evaluate and comment and

355
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:47,020
recommend ways to improve those
detection and response procedures what

356
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:53,389
we're really trying to do here is that
response effectiveness so as an example

357
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:58,919
there was a time when we were attacking
as an external adversary we identify a

358
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:03,220
system that is accessible from the
internet never should have been

359
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,470
accessible from the Internet has Tomcat
Manager on there with default

360
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,890
credentials we access the

361
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:18,409
the console we deploy a web application
back door and they have a host base IPS

362
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:24,809
to text a back door and send up a wagon
creates an event in their security

363
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:30,559
operation center there's a junior
analyst going through the Q who sees

364
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:38,820
this alert that there was now were
detected on a server the IPS noted that

365
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:44,470
this malware had been quarantined and
cleaned and the status was green and no

366
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,480
further action was required the analyst
close the ticket and went to the next

367
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,790
item in the queue with no further
thoughts on our side we notice way to

368
00:31:54,790 --> 00:32:00,460
happen to be uploaded this back door but
it wasn't there we modified our payload

369
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,900
packed it in a different way and used
two different command control channel

370
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:10,520
uploaded it again and this time it
worked and that compromised system

371
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,049
provided the single pivot point
necessary to go from the internet to

372
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:18,049
full access to the majority of their
internal network

373
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:24,900
so this was a process they have the
technical capability to detect that

374
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,740
initial back door that we up that we
uploaded and it worked it was detected

375
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:37,510
but the response was not effective data
analyst should have asked why is there a

376
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:42,590
malware on this system this is a server
this is not something where somebody's

377
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:47,689
going to get now we're thru opening an
e-mail alert drive-by download or

378
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,770
anything like that if there's malware on
this system this means that somebody has

379
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:57,389
administrative access to that system
that's a problem that should have

380
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:03,360
triggered incident response
investigation if the security operations

381
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,550
team had known that this was an exercise
there is a very high likelihood when

382
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:16,610
confronted they would have said yes we
knew there was an exercise going on so

383
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,649
we would have identified identified a
process failure in there that would have

384
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:25,220
been reported as a non-binding because
the operations team has this legitimate

385
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,800
explanation we never followed up on this
further because we knew it was an

386
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:35,810
exercise so if you maintain the hyper
realism you have a much better

387
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:46,110
capability to evaluate the detection and
response controls we do have clients

388
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,729
that don't want their security
operations team tied up responding to

389
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:55,260
what if there was a real attacked that
occurs during the time frame that we're

390
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:00,700
doing this adversary simulation
similarly will have concerns around

391
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,430
availability what happens if there's an
availability incident how do I know

392
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:11,060
whether or not it's related to what
you're doing this goes back to having a

393
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
single point of contact

394
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:19,049
thats high enough highly placed in the
organization so that they can see what's

395
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:22,250
going on so someone who has the
awareness

396
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,860
the availability command center or
whatever team is responsible for

397
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:32,220
availability of systems someone who has
high enough visibility to see what the

398
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:37,480
security operations team is doing so
that they can then make the decision on

399
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:45,040
a case-by-case basis to determine how do
I weigh the relative benefits and

400
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,820
relative concerns first wanting to
maintain the realism of the assessment

401
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:57,760
and second needing to be agile on the
corporation side and determine at a

402
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,100
certain point know this is bad for
actually under attack we need all hands

403
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,250
on deck dealing with the real incident
were going to pull the plug on the

404
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:11,320
adversary simulation and that exercise
notify the security team that that was

405
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,550
an exercise so that we can focus on this
real malicious attack we've seen that

406
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,210
happen is pretty rare but we need to
make sure we have all of this documented

407
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:27,590
ahead of time so we want to avoid data
leakage to the SEC ops team anything

408
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:35,160
that would indicate that this is only an
exercise so these the operations the red

409
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,430
team need to be done with this in mind
so there should be nothing in the the

410
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:44,680
trade craft of the red team that
indicates that this is a drill there

411
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,960
should be nothing reference seen the
name of the company whose performing the

412
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,340
red team assessment there should be
nothing that looks like this is just

413
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:01,890
part of a simulation it should look
authentic it should cause some level of

414
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:06,319
theory in the security operations team
that they are under a real malicious

415
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,330
attack we want to avoid premature
termination of the exercise

416
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:18,290
this means that that point of contact
needs to be coached so that when they go

417
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,960
when they have somebody on the security
operations team who comes to them and

418
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,119
says we've detected this anomaly here
we've noticed that there was a backdoor

419
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,640
on this system and we've pulled it off
line and we believe the problem solved

420
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,470
that point of contact should not
immediately respond with a good job we

421
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:44,250
had an exercise you detected it looks
like everything's good because what's

422
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,150
normally happens by that point we moved
on to other systems in the organization

423
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:54,240
and we have multiple back doors
multipole I'm tamanna control channels

424
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,759
into the environment and we want to let
that response run its course if the

425
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,750
security operations team declares
success to clarence eradication

426
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,589
are red team access into the environment
but we still have access to one or more

427
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:17,020
systems there's something wrong because
that means that if this was a malicious

428
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,290
attack they're going to shut down their
instant response process while they're

429
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:27,050
still being attacked in a silky covert
manner by a malicious adversary that's a

430
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:31,990
problem we want to take all of that into
account in planning for the

431
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,529
communications and the escalation I'm
process with the client in with that

432
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:41,880
primary point of contact as a side note
that primary point of contact is usually

433
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,280
someone outside of the security
operations team so that they don't have

434
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,260
that inherent conflict of interest

435
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,660
it's usually someone who is at the
executive level or a designated

436
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,980
lieutenant of the sea so for example
someone once we have this all planned

437
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:09,810
out what are the guidelines for the
actual execution of the first principles

438
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:14,400
to be strategic recognized only an
executive is likely to have the

439
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,680
authority to approve this plan so if
you're not talking to

440
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,390
an executive in the organization you're
likely not going to be able to do a full

441
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:27,200
realistic adversaries simulation is all
of those various competing client

442
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,910
concerns will win out over the realism
of the assessment and some executives

443
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,670
don't have the confidence to approve
this they're not willing to put a stake

444
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,050
in the ground and say yes we are going
to do this because we know that we're

445
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:46,240
going to be attacked eventually and we
want to know how prepared we are and I'm

446
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,839
said it before I'll say it again the
technical compromise doesn't matter if

447
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,570
you can't show business impact so find
what it is that the executive team will

448
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,850
understand that's usually especially in
a public corporation what is going to

449
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,470
affect the stock price if it hits the
front page of the New York Times what is

450
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:10,700
there that is going to directly affect
the bottom line have a material impact

451
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:20,529
on the business second be deliberate
stay focused stay focused on the

452
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:27,190
objective there have been times where
we've had to politely true out a member

453
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:32,160
of the red team with less experience
when they identify and compromises

454
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,440
system and they're very proud of
themselves they've found an exploited a

455
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,250
high risk finding but it doesn't get us
access that we didn't already have and

456
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:45,080
so it's not very realistic not
accurately modeling a sophisticated

457
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,080
adversary if we had credentials to log
into the system

458
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:53,589
why would be running exploit here and
raise our likelihood of detection we

459
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:59,030
never know with 100% certainty what the
security controls are that are in place

460
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:08,510
so stay focused on the end objective
remember your OPSEC remember to avoid

461
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:12,030
cross-contamination between different
avenues of attack

462
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:17,410
don't use the same command and control
server or your Dropbox that was placed

463
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:22,899
on the network through physical attack
and your spear phishing campaign that

464
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:30,310
sends out something from PowerShell
embedded in office map you don't want

465
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:36,930
detection of 12 results in detection of
all of the others that objective in a

466
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,009
laser focused on that objected

467
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:46,450
globally but globally remember to only
strike when you know that you can strike

468
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:52,250
precisely and evaluate that risk-reward
there's always a trade off there's

469
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:59,280
always every action you take is going to
raise the potential for detection know

470
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,850
that no the tools know what the tools
dunno what the tools look like on the

471
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:10,150
wire know what your manual techniques
look like on the wire test your payloads

472
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:15,750
your techniques against the various
detective security controls so that you

473
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:22,780
know you can make an intelligent
decision at each and every step if I eat

474
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:27,420
if I undertake this attack technique how
much does this raise my likelihood

475
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,660
detection and what new access to give me
that I didn't have before then you can

476
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:37,430
make an intelligent decision about
whether to engage in that attack vs any

477
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:42,169
of the half dozen others that you might
be able to try finally

478
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:51,180
agile adaptive and opportunistic don't
get too focused on this potential 0 day

479
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,960
that you might have found over here that
you really want to keep digging into

480
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:00,170
because it's fascinating if that's your
best way in sure go home

481
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:06,460
but if there's a window unlocked over
here don't waste hours trying to pick

482
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,900
this very complex lock on the front door
the real adversary is going to take the

483
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:17,000
path of least resistance so we should do
likewise thank you

484
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:28,380
any questions yes

485
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:58,059
mining company where the reaction he
prescribed reaction to the threat

486
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:04,329
against a certain set of boxes is
essentially a shutdown large portions of

487
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:10,270
the operation and since he already has a
brain with zero knowledge they may not

488
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:15,470
have yet to discover the map of what
this server controls versus what the

489
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:20,589
other service controls so they're
looking and the compromise and get some

490
00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:25,920
random server but it turns out to be
something that controls the power plant

491
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,250
and the response is to shut down that
server and shut down the mine and he had

492
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,440
this cascading hanging causes real
impact how do you manage that

493
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:41,240
so if I'm understanding the question
correctly its high

494
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:47,540
if we're if our primary objective
involve some sort of causing a denial of

495
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:53,140
service how do we test that when we may
not know the full impact that the

496
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:58,140
systems that were affecting now it's
more along the lines that it's not that

497
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:07,410
you cause harm in the reaction of the
blue team is extreme right and in it in

498
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:12,460
something that maybe you even know about
what they're standing reactions are you

499
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:18,170
don't know you hit that sent box right
so there are usually two criteria that

500
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:25,250
we define our rules of engagement that
affect the decision do we are doing not

501
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:30,670
inform the blue team that this is an
exercise their first criteria is is the

502
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:35,650
security operations team about to
involve law enforcement is is it going

503
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,950
to go outside the confines of the
organization and the second is is the

504
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:45,120
response process about to in any way
impact business operations so that would

505
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,620
fall into that second category and
that's really on that point of contact

506
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:54,589
is monitoring the blue team monitoring
the security operations team to make a

507
00:44:54,590 --> 00:45:00,220
judgment call so if there's a single
user workstation that has been detected

508
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,890
as compromise

509
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:07,920
it's usually going to be worth the risk
of business disruption to pulled out

510
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,660
workstation offline image it issued that
user a clean workstation even though it

511
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:19,069
does result in a loss of productivity
for that one user because it is worth it

512
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:24,310
is worth that expense in order to reap
the benefits of having more realistic

513
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:29,400
full attack simulation however when we
start looking at a response where the

514
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:35,160
next step involves shutting down a
server or by me we've had organizations

515
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,290
where someone on the response team
proposes we don't know how deep this is

516
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:44,950
gone we know that they're on the system
that is the the last stop before we send

517
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:50,029
out a wire transfer instructions to the
Fed wire system and their next step

518
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:55,250
would be to disconnect that system from
that wire cut back connection and all of

519
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:59,850
a sudden none of their none of their
clients are able to conduct business

520
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:05,529
through their system that's the point at
which they call and exercise don't

521
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:10,230
actually show up a system off here's
what's going on and then at that point

522
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:16,610
moves more to a tabletop what what our
next steps if this were real attack and

523
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:20,870
it's often very revealing because
usually the client's haven't fully

524
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:27,029
thought through if this critical system
is compromised and see if it's not a

525
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:31,130
drill and bits of malicious adversary
how do we make that business decision

526
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:37,720
how do you evaluate whether you're going
to shut down a critical system that's

527
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,879
required for your business operations vs

528
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:47,460
allowing an attack to continue either
way is damaging to the business and

529
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,990
either way there's a lot of risk and
somebody's going to question the

530
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:56,140
decision that you made afterwards and so
it's it's usually very enlightening for

531
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,529
our clients to need to be faced with
that decision as part of a drill before

532
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:09,420
they need to face it as part of a
malicious attack other questions yes

533
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:20,280
get planes to execute a hard time
hearing you ok yes how often do you get

534
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,550
Lions went to execute the perfect right
team exercise like you're describing

535
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:32,299
and apart from executed by the house
what are the other factors which helping

536
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:41,980
getting that perfect well budget is an
obvious one simply having the financial

537
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:46,880
resources to commit to this type of
exercise in terms of how often we do it

538
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,170
that's that's really what we focus on
that went with infusion acts that is our

539
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:59,930
specialty that is what our team has been
purpose-built for so essentially if a if

540
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:05,210
a given client is not wanting to do that
type of an assessment I will go

541
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:10,059
somewhere else with more junior team
where they'll pay less money to get the

542
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:13,920
type of assessment that they're looking
for so if a client works with us it's

543
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,520
really because they want that

544
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,559
full-on adversaries simulation in order
to understand the ability to prevent

545
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:27,200
detect and respond so with that training
I'd say that I'd probably greater than

546
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,839
95% of our assessments are the full
no-holds-barred attack simulations

547
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,569
time to get it off so that's another
round of being a politician

548
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:51,910
thank you and just just one final note
if this sounds like something you want

549
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:55,980
to be doing please talk to me because we
are absolutely looking to expand our

550
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,980
team thank you

551
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:06,589
and behalf besides our sponsor fit
better thank you thank you so much
