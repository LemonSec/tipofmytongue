00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
thank you for that lovely whose

2
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:36,380
2012 hands I can I don't know my wet
right

3
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:43,680
25 minutes let's take minutes for this
talk so I guess it high-tech solution

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,140
the girls thank you

5
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:59,149
someone going to ok has anyone ever seen
one of the scene on YouTube keiko so for

6
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:03,809
those of you who have no idea what I'm
talking about but that's a good thing I

7
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,340
can so three security people walking to
the bus stop me if you've heard this one

8
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:19,600
yet the three people a security person
that security person and the security

9
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:28,880
place and if you will get into an
interview that's kinda like one of those

10
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,860
three percent if you haven't seen me on
youtube if you don't know who I am I'm

11
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,670
just a person a conference standing in
front of you asking you to listen to me

12
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:47,159
if you have seen on YouTube then you're
like oh he's a person who talks some

13
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:57,649
bullets sorry these no 128 that can you
edit that out I'm not I joined a gym for

14
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:03,509
about a year ago and it's the first time
I I got a PR person who actually like my

15
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,880
wrist every time I step up

16
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,880
thank you thank you

17
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:42,239
reaction I was actually a person to you
now but by the end of it all demonstrate

18
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,180
how I am the security person so is
broken into three acts like a classical

19
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,830
drama but like Marvel comic this
something after the trailer so don't

20
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,860
lead to quick think that after the
credits I don't need to quickly this

21
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,700
isn't a talk about how to write CD or
how to go and give an interview with the

22
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,988
body language issue the language or the
city should wear this pin you really

23
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,359
want people who can help you do that
this is more about how do you feel

24
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:21,650
Korea how to map out your part and how
do you get ahead I don't need to have my

25
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:30,160
Korea I'm perfectly happy I can create a
long and what is not my life does not

26
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,880
describe anyone is anyone really really
happy really happy in their job you've

27
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,799
got the right type of work and the right
type of money or your other pay and you

28
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,630
know if you are not great but watching
disruption happens and we will talk

29
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,870
about disruption because the next few
days you've been hearing a lot about

30
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,130
disruption because every stop is
disrupted in in the security space but

31
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,680
on a personal level we get distracted
all the time sometimes we get married we

32
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,079
get them also we have kids and and they
will depend on it when we need to look

33
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,900
out for the weekend or a company
acquired by another company

34
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,299
home Mariano things happen things get
destructive and then you know what you

35
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:21,230
don't want to be back to square one way
it's like to see the ball go up lie like

36
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,730
a security person hey look I got see I
double xp

37
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:34,760
that should mean they're not it doesn't
so a lot this ideal to my own Korea

38
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,770
many years because I found myself in a
position where like you know more than

39
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:45,539
one page I shouldn't have to compete
with the masses of herds

40
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:56,930
I see thanks making it but let's say you
did find a decent job and one thing I

41
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,350
found very early in my career that fits
that come along with it

42
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,680
job that you know you'll be treated
fairly

43
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,930
you know you'll be rewarded purely on
your good work and nothing else it's ok

44
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:17,690
to take matters into my own hands when
we reached the first reading main point

45
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:26,590
that I love but being serious about this
knowledge and a lot of what we do we

46
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,669
spend our time focusing on the x-axis
you spend your entire career saying you

47
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:36,609
need to learn more so we agreed that we
take courses we come to conferences and

48
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,980
we learn about technical staff and all
that good stuff but simply moving along

49
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,090
the x-axis isn't enough

50
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:53,080
y axis nice layout is also this yr
indicates how far you reach

51
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,180
influence goes with knowledge

52
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:03,120
actually affect positively with that
knowledge you could be the best web

53
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,290
developer in the world you can code some
seriously secure stop that no one can

54
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,750
get into but if that is an adopted or
easily implemented understandable by

55
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:20,229
Others the value goes down so I can
break it down to let you know

56
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:22,620
overhead downtown on this side of

57
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,180
the lower end may be on your line
manager realizes the value as you go up

58
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,050
the industry all Europeans began to
recognize the value and ride the top the

59
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,770
public you know that you know that's
Kennedy is being asked to come on folks

60
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:42,740
all the time and this is where you know
someone who knew you would would be so

61
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,820
that we can play a game and the game
which I I started off well you know

62
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,270
where do I think I am on the knowledge
that 00 let you know if this is like you

63
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,770
know the some 100 just secure in the
knowledge within your particular field

64
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:05,570
how much how far along I am i on this
and then how does my influence and reach

65
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:12,710
go how many people actually know I know
that much about security and then it's

66
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:19,849
completely arbitrary points and I think
so I think about different people how

67
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,960
much do they actually know and how much
are they know well how much influence I

68
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,070
have a positive influence on this so you
can I call this quick this hippie two

69
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,780
lines Peter lines is a gentleman I used
to work with a bank and he probably knew

70
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,960
more about called security than anyone
I've ever met he was about seventy the

71
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,299
last time I saw him he was still working
he was involved with the first debit

72
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:54,139
cards design in in UK advised many banks
and regulations and everything like that

73
00:07:54,139 --> 00:08:00,250
but he's very content in just in his own
way and no one else at the age of 71

74
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,520
who's just back to retire he actually
was anything less than what most of the

75
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,570
other junior consults that make money
isn't there

76
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,610
excuses on why people don't really know
that much

77
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,220
the not really willing to increase the
knowledge and the not really like

78
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,039
sharing reaching out to people so they
tend to make excuses you know what i'm

79
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,610
looking a pay rise because I'm short

80
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:33,220
or I'm brown or emotional weight you
know more about facial hair tattoos or

81
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:40,430
piercings do what you know and then you
find other people that live in short as

82
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,030
well yeah ok

83
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:55,180
overhead this is the worst known to be
in Piers Morgan that's a good 10 it was

84
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,650
I don't know I'm just trying to somehow
I need to get rid of this these are

85
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,310
meant to be sorry

86
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:08,380
diabetic was then you can come from
poison you have something I I guess that

87
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,090
the Gregory D and Vince

88
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:17,050
bubble butt Piers Morgan is good and it
really cool same here because I think

89
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,630
this is one of the main things had a
really quick

90
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:26,350
Facebook light tight reaction to give me
you can do and also you chocolate or

91
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,110
answer your question

92
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:37,050
good but now I came on this date in just
a week but now I'm that speak up on that

93
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:43,870
speaker who explained that wonderfully
complex in a formality and on that

94
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,200
speaker who's been assaulting you with
chocolates

95
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,660
now come to this conference a not given
that I would just come as a person and

96
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,589
as a person but this way influenced this
whole wrinkle of fantastic security

97
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,279
professionals

98
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:09,740
a highly professional and I'll be
looking at an AA people on some people

99
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:17,009
call it stalking intensive research into
what some of our parents do what makes

100
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:22,920
them great successful so one thing they
do they can make others look good you

101
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,319
know sometimes there's a tendency to
want to the credit and you did great

102
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:31,420
stuff and do the credit but you make us
look good in the process

103
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,639
Ashley what's really well you're always
pitching and and this is a comment the

104
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,870
guy he pushed me on the cheek and then
suggested to go fuck myself just a

105
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:51,990
recluse interview with me as well you
know sometimes we become in this free

106
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:58,509
booze and parties and people and then
you're like someone is really good but

107
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:02,449
then you get from someone told me to be
what you think of it all you can

108
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:07,059
remember is that person drunk and making
inappropriate comments was a marketing

109
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:16,089
lady so you know these things go along
way create a create a new consumer and I

110
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,040
think you know in our industry did like
this people was creating stuff but you

111
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,000
know the more you create as opposed to
the more berries for everyone

112
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:30,550
fathers really easy to say hey man I
totally owned this is done

113
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,800
ok well done you know the as an industry
we've been doing that for many years

114
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,258
what we did to make that better

115
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:46,040
embracing limitations who knows who this
gentleman is it possible so he said that

116
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:59,740
he liked me whoever said that yeah it's
not even a single he he had

117
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:09,868
this peace offering

118
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:22,839
he couldn't get through a whole sense to
incorporate that actually singing

119
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:29,699
ok he only had one hit that kind of
ruins a narrative

120
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:35,259
trust me you can embrace your
limitations that there are people who

121
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:38,679
work in remote parts of the world now
they don't have come to conferences but

122
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,040
they can still make an impact in the
industry

123
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,589
there are people who have some
challenges but you know what this thing

124
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:55,819
and you do that by embracing invitations
this picture of me I don't like throw up

125
00:12:55,819 --> 00:13:01,910
because I was about to throw up this is
in 2012 London and was about to go and

126
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:07,959
get my first talk and five minutes and
you know they say it's all about the

127
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:14,268
initial push just get the ball rolling
and absolute rubbish because five

128
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:18,259
minutes in I was shaking and all like I
just want this to end

129
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:21,790
you know I could see people looking on
the funds and losing interest in the

130
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:30,079
back but that's alright but now everyone
on the backswing de cuenta me di cuenta

131
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:38,059
me but yes I think it speaking of on the
things he's like animals just enough

132
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:44,839
miles up and you get a bit better that's
not good at writing and blogging than we

133
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,989
did you get that kind of thing is that
10,000 hour rule that much more

134
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:56,790
enjoyable things obligatory motivational
poster I don't have an account when they

135
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,790
start to hurt the ones that really
matter

136
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:08,779
factory walking the talk so how do you
bring all these things together and and

137
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:18,209
do that so he's familiar with what this
is it says it on it here so this epistle

138
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:25,069
create this is what I used to refer to
my personal website the 1 I'm going to a

139
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,940
conference because I know it doesn't
look at our media whore actually but

140
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:36,950
yeah I'm saying okay do you think this
kind of my money on taking my back

141
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,519
pocket and what is it do I know I'm
talking about knowledge is power

142

stuff through the beauty of Instagram

152

networking and without saying that you

155
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,380
my personal hygiene and all that kind of
stuff but we can all do something that

156
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,850
this is where I need your help

157
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:06,560
time do we have left yet so like I said
this a bit like mobile I'm gonna pretend

162
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,970
but I'm gonna seconds later as well but
none of you can refute because I

163
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:34,620
hundred-percent the treat all done so
within on call right now gone from being

164
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,879
that buy to the guy you want speaking at
your security conferences because this

165
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,840
is the most entertaining security
professional in the world and why mean

166
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:53,809
by that is you can distort your own
reality and you can make you can't wait

167
00:17:53,809 --> 00:18:00,928
for people to come on and recognize your
work you need to demonstrate and

168
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:04,429
sometimes that means been doing some
trees in a way

169
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:15,400
slightly I'm not saying like I'm not
saying maybe it's but I'm saying what

170
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,720
you doing to get noticed I'm sure most
of you remember this is Ben best 20

171
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:27,090
minutes of my life but I remember this
at least maybe you might not remember my

172
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,020
name or anything but some might say well
you have that talk about something that

173
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:41,889
you coul yes how many of the speakers
have done that and find you on call in

174
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:47,490
your career what are you doing in your
career you remember when you leave a job

175
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,780
do you actually think about the project
worked on other than in a bad light back

176
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,600
how messed up it was but you know what
do these people think of you what went

177
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,678
when they read your name on any
documentation on apprentice while they

178
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,330
thinking about what legacy have you left
behind

179
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,610
have you left behind enough legacy that
they say you know what we wouldn't mind

180
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,549
having this person back

181
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:18,809
and one of the ways that i think is fine
and the media rushing to reginald D

182
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:24,539
hunter I think and he was like americans
have loved like these motivational short

183
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:29,889
phrases but they don't mean anything
it's like the true to yourself in batman

184
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:35,758
is like to defeat fear I must become
that which would be like to defeat SQL

185
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:43,239
injection I must become SQL injection so
I I looked around and cost around a few

186
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:47,450
people were not what was the best
definition of finding unique and one of

187
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,889
the ones I settled on which is like you
know it's it's the intersection between

188
00:19:51,889 --> 00:20:03,369
your expertise and one of your passions
and if you can if you can find the

189
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:10,678
intersection and and that could work and
that the person I can make that person

190
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:14,759
and even become that person in industry
at the moment can can account for a not

191
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:19,809
so now his name escapes me the guy who
does the faces of Dec on with a coffee

192
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:26,389
and lemon that the portraits yeah
exactly see you know and how do you know

193
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:36,279
if he didn't do his thing so how would
you have known if he hadn't done that a

194
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:40,519
lot of my success in my trade offer us
I'm making stupid videos

195
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,519
flashing my sis bag and all that kind of
stuff

196
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:54,320
and wait with you find your passion away
with your ex parte watching didn't want

197
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:02,760
to come see that soldier was absolutely
fantastic but not that guy he's his

198
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,980
nation's like you know he's called
demonstrate disney's mainframe security

199
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,510
connected to the Internet

200
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:14,260
something you know hardly anyone else is
doing if any if anyone's doing it if I

201
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:20,110
say I can cause who do you think there
are few names that pop into your mind if

202
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:25,810
I scanning the internet who do you think
that there's things that you think off

203
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,159
and then you immediately you might go to
a few people and then there's some

204
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,460
people just generally I just want a safe
pair of hands to babysit this risk

205
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:42,750
assessment or doing like these assurance
activities they're just there a security

206
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,860
person that's just a teacher in general
but you want something more specific

207
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:53,169
than you go to those people that you did
that person and and and that's kind of

208
00:21:53,170 --> 00:22:00,740
like the essence of one trying to get a
leading with three-party thoughts

209
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,110
because I read this book about
Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs and

210
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,270
he was something threes

211
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:16,120
step outside your comfort because that's
a lot of people I wasn't joking on your

212
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,310
I'm an introvert

213
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:22,929
like you know a lot public interaction
air force myself and you know get better

214
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:27,000
at public speaking and hopefully I'm
slightly better you can treat me

215
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,040
disagree

216
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:37,020
keep improving acquiring the skills and
the skills knowledge and your passion

217
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,730
when i guess im making you to be
absolutely atrocious I want to protect

218
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,880
her when she was just horrible and now
it's marginally better by even now I

219
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,350
still like you have a lot to learn and
the most important thing and people will

220
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,840
say no to some of the new kitchen out
and no I'm talking to some of the older

221
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,490
kids in here as well because sometimes
people do a really bad job of protecting

222
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,820
their reputation and reputation for such
a long way in such a small incestuous

223
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:11,200
industry is like you know if you're one
person they interviewed someone else I

224
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,860
know you and your friend of someone so
when the sister of that you know it's

225
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:21,649
such as an industry that unless you
address your reputation you can lose a

226
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:30,710
lot very quickly the industry if you
read like 100 percent sure that the

227
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,320
skills gap figures but what I do know
that there are plenty of jobs out there

228
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,580
and if you're not making the money that
you want to make and if you're not doing

229
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:46,610
the work that you enjoy doing that's
motivating and challenging you then I

230
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,000
don't think that's industry for us it's
easy to fall into the excuses trap but I

231
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,140
think there's plenty of opportunity to
it is only half now so I couldn't go

232
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,280
into detail on this number but detailed
analysis on on on most flights but you

233
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:07,160
can hook me up afterwards but you know
the limitations may itself isn't the bin

234
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,530
faisal the industry who knows how to
make hay while the Sun shines

235
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:34,190
and without that really is the end thank
you very much thank you thank you very

236
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:34,530
much
