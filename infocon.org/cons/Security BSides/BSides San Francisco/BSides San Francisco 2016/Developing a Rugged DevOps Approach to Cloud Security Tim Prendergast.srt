1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
so the sponsors for making this
available may happen I know so if you

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,889
have a chance please send feedback
information is located on your ticket

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,850
and also on the website on the schedule
page and today we have to endure guests

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:28,660
please give a welcome thank you everyone
just so was conscious the fact that I

5
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,450
stand between you guys and the bar which
thank you whoever organizing the fog at

6
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,790
that one but there's so much material to
cover here I kind of took approach to

7
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,920
get you guys kind of the seeds of
thinking about changing approach to

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,789
changing paradigm here and I'll talk to
some technical samples were not gonna go

9
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:49,270
through a bunch of demos for WA bunch of
code examples because it's something

10
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,180
that actually is better suited for you
to explore the journey on your own but

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:56,829
but exploited a kind of what it means to
get a rugged doubts approach to securing

12
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:00,989
protecting the cloud which is really as
everyone thinks about it

13
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,119
your datacenter that someone else's
house inquiry now it was the dinner you

14
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:09,560
host has used in a very different way of
all the things that happened around this

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,640
cloud movement the most exciting is
happening now is specifically around

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,869
security shirt school like lasts eyes
were closed

17
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,979
you know something I can stand up and
down resources on the man in this paper

18
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,549
I use but the value it brings more we
talk about the approach we take the

19
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:28,869
security and the challenges we face we
moved the Sarah are far more

20
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:32,850
exhilarating and what people get excited
about like a I can run it as a future

21
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,250
version thousand servers the idea that
aim of all those servers they can take

22
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,659
dynamic security postures on they can be
reflexive it reacts the kind requests

23
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:45,600
coming into home and these changes
happen the second time frames is a

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,000
wholly different paradigm used to
insecurity and it's something that we

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,930
should really think about taking
advantage of

26
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,620
gonna give you guys like the step 11
background what is cloud also this

27
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,770
argument that trevor is a programmatic
infrastructure it could be anything at

28
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,539
all for that but they have in the sense
that its API driven infrastructure it's

29
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,330
not what vMware is going to sell you
guys it's not what Amazon Web Services

30
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,860
specifically tells you it is it really
is a different way for sanitation

31
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,240
infrastructure that's goes beyond that
rack and stack approach we took and

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,490
Sunday reference it was def up asking
for a sentence rebel pretty much knows

33
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,450
it is really just smart people building
things no more intelligent way I mean it

34
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,720
means automation scale me just get away
from the typical behaviour we used to do

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,000
so when you think about this
acceleration for supplying its structure

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,420
and applications and services we called
them off their specific needs that have

37
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,799
arisen that drive people to get into
this state and those needs are

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,750
specifically focused around flexible
rapid iterations and testing and

39
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,080
validation of what you're doing and then
entering port on that meaning don't wait

40
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,489
six months to put this new innovation
out there for users means wait a week

41
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,820
after ECB to start using what you've
built and then learn how to using it

42
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,750
learn the cool things you can do it and
then in a report on that the same time

43
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,290
securities never gone away I mean I
always here for a particular reason all

44
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,540
of us here have jobs at Boca some aspect
on this we have to bring to business or

45
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,160
an entity some sense of control some
sense of stability some sense of risk

46
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,640
aversion because we all know that a
major compromise tends to end a lot of

47
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,619
small medium businesses and large with
us as well it kinda sloppy suffer

48
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,350
massive reputational damage over time

49
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,430
fight surveyed the crowd had everyone
who showed up the name of a company that

50
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,360
has a bad reputation for security I know
by the five or six almost everyone gonna

51
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,570
shout out that's a sad state in the
industry but also telling to how we as

52
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,180
humans emotionally connect to people not
doing it in the can to protect us

53
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,310
think it's really interesting about this
is we inadvertently jam these two worlds

54
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:59,250
together and we did that because
security is still relevant function for

55
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,400
a business but the businesses also said
we have to move faster and historically

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,020
acceleration is not the best friend the
security the dynamics in the mass change

57
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:14,330
introduces chaos comics hard drive
signal from noise right but there's a

58
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,260
new way to protect me think about doing
this we can actually happen to the best

59
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,820
of all worlds and this is a day that I
can struggle with which is I had to step

60
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,150
out of my traditional IRA tower
paratrooper knight shining armor save

61
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,250
the day kind of role are you instant
response and that's like the end of the

62
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,580
security discussion with a lot of people
that's what you convince them to be part

63
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,870
of the solution and into this educator
roll this embracing all like hey you

64
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,750
know the kind of the phone this building
this application in managing some

65
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,320
structure is a really bright person he
just hasn't had 15 years ago his butt

66
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,210
kicked in this industry like I have and
if I can actually teach him or enable

67
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,989
him in some way to not have to go
through that same pain and I went

68
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,210
through and learn from what I'm trying
to tell him as the right way to do

69
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,109
things without me being to go with big
stick then we can actually come out with

70
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,050
head and a quick survey who here thinks
you have enough people at your company

71
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:12,830
doing security I'll see you outside
buddy who here has opened job extra

72
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:20,219
security so this is the pain point we
see we can just do just enough people to

73
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,570
actually manage security we can't say a
call next year's graduating classes

74
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,560
coming out fully ready come protect the
instructor we've been building for years

75
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,350
it's one of those things where yet to
take advantage of the people that you

76
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,340
can kinda train up and what's really in
terms of people really get this right

77
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,390
now are those engineers and product
names rebuilding the infrastructure that

78
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,719
you used to protecting the datacenter
you know how to do in the cloud shows

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,400
paradigms told you ship the one thing
that you see that's really different

80
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,500
here is not only the ownership aspect of
the infrastructure layer but really how

81
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,160
it kind of taken these broader concept
we build walls around the garden rate

82
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,020
and saying we actually have resources
that can exist for seven minutes I don't

83
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,630
get up my data center had a thousand
service yesterday 200

84
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,580
day been robbed right I also didn't get
up and walk in there talking to see a

85
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,950
one tracked service not like 500 racks
of servers it doesn't happen the data

86
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,039
center to expectation of things being
static is how we got security around it

87
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,270
was a quiet zones for networking and
travel no means a place and put

88
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,210
firewalls around those I can actually
put ideas online everything I own my

89
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,549
ways to get what I want to get so I can
try and do my job better

90
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,680
the cloud basically took that threw out
the window said she'll by the way you

91
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,540
don't own this and you're not allowed to
come plugged directly into it and trust

92
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,370
us we're doing everything for you

93
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,030
the reality situation is they do
anything below a certain player but use

94
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,429
the customer owned everything that's
really relevant a player the networks

95
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,110
track that the network traffic stack
what's kind of really changed is the way

96
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,340
to interface with these cloud of church
services right so you think about it it

97
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,500
is unheard of API program like to go
expect that kind of stuff against like

98
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,570
old firewalls fixes you know I guess I
guess is terrible nothings the same

99
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,780
unifying constant cloud objectives
programmatic we have an ATI interface it

100
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:08,640
now seeks universally to identity
network storage server is actually

101
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,380
really different approach now we can
actually talk on one language plane to

102
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,670
all these different layers and then
cross correlate across so this is

103
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,500
actually enabling a whole new era of
security forces when those things that

104
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:26,510
we're excited to talk about ya little
box changed so why is it cool cause the

105
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,240
factors and actually told to change this
didn't happen in the datacenter we call

106
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,140
this the side door to the cloud so when
you think about it it's not like someone

107
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,599
puts up a new server inside your
firewall in the cloud and then someone

108
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,670
get total control of your datacenter
server came online that just happened

109
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,580
that common in the real world Michigan
hardcore owed 800 what's happened is

110
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,950
we've taken the stack we had three to
stop whatever you want cause logical

111
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,080
your web application hoster kind of same
these are containerized functions are

112
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,320
you can sport around wherever you want
and the way we defend applications and

113
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,330
services at a player secure coding
lifecycle you know verifying your office

114
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,700
top 10 20 or are you know being guarded
against doing typical you know 'cause

115
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,080
can ask him sconce type isn't that

116
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,520
new and it's not really changing much
what changed was we talk about where all

117
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,799
my data records that really matter we
actually dissolved laboring giant Oracle

118
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,340
Siebel clusters and put those into
managed to be services no lot of

119
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,638
infrastructure will also take an
additional storage host which by the way

120
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,099
is much wallpaper then there's a big
stack you know sure when those boxes

121
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:37,500
right we've taken those in this all
those objects into like storage services

122
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,500
archival objects Torquay Dropbox for all
we care right someone else is giving a

123
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,690
presentation layer that we engage and
push data to and we need the data back

124
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,310
we asked for it and that contract of
getting that back and forth unacceptable

125
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,310
agency has said we don't have to manage
these things the other things said

126
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,099
implicitly that we all don't accept is
that now have to figure out a protective

127
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,110
over any services where they are
publicly accessible so in the datacenter

128
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,570
not just walk to the wall in your
instructions for tripping out servers we

129
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,000
have multiple instances where publicly
accessible cloudy skies have led to the

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,560
complete demise of companies in this
industry AC Moore's paper on s3 bucket

131
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,630
walking

132
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,610
global namespace you can type in brand
names and eventually gonna get back and

133
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,540
you get back to have medical records
legal records because there's so many

134
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,810
permutations and there's so many micro
represent security policy around every

135
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,010
instance of an object you can create an
asset mccloud that how do you know that

136
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,189
the three billion object you created is
consistent with the other 2.99 billion

137
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,959
or 80 someone internally didn't change
that policy and make it accessible pop

138
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,768
the link on pace to evidence that point
on your entire payroll record like this

139
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,860
is actually the challenge you face in
the crowd now there were no longer in

140
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,329
complete control but we have a new way
to think about this

141
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,580
I will become very unpopular very
quickly we have done a good job in

142
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,580
industry product and I started on
security products out of the house and

143
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,710
when defender now back on product we
havin a good job keeping up with the

144
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,630
change I mean shot and puppet structures
code component have been around five

145
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,870
seven-plus years right and really
popular past three or four where's the

146
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,880
security innovation been like right we
still think that you can just take my

147
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,140
kid you not I won't name names had been
assure like take this big load Ballinger

148
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,980
you have your day isn't just a virtual
appliance mccloud it'll do the exact

149
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,150
same thing and you said that you like I
went to this whole this whole iteration

150
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,860
of redesigning my architecture the way I
think it things and concepts and loosely

151
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,660
coupling application in destroying all
these concepts twenty years of

152
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,230
instruction and undo that and then put
something right in the middle of the

153
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,690
Giants single point of failure and this
is not the way to engineer cloud and

154
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,480
finally the feeling has been the fourth
incursion thought leaders have embraced

155
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,240
permanent structure have not been the
security companies they're still

156
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,890
building products and solving challenges
they know happened datacenter meanwhile

157
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,480
the world kinda moving into a new
paradigm and we're lagging because it

158
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,490
and part of that challenge also as the
way we've structured ourselves in the

159
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,130
industry community and if you think
about it the DevOps communities in a

160
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,570
great job with check on public on you
know all these diff centre conferences

161
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,480
people get up here and they open the
kimono and they dumped all the

162
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,240
information out and you guys copy get up
get up go home and start from there new

163
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,080
baseline fundamentally in the security
industry we've not been as open and we

164
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,980
not been as welcoming to others and we
haven't been able to share as you know

165
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,300
illicitly is as that community has
that's one of the things that we have to

166
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,930
think about in a social way of changing
over time we're gonna be stuck here

167
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,630
so how do you freshen the stack right

168
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:52,360
think about it you know there's a whole
set of major services that comprise

169
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,029
probably sixty to seventy percent of
your infrastructure in the cloud that

170
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:00,500
are completely API driven no ip
addresses can't networks Canon Canon

171
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,960
mapping nothin August 18 points open but
you know what there's thousands of

172
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,810
functions and millions of assets behind
those guys that you now have to actually

173
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,660
protect and think about how you guard
and if you go top down I'm an old

174
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,550
network nerds like I can watch the OSI
model the OSI model kind of around here

175
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:24,760
think about the business process that
ATP workday none of us are gonna worry

176
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,650
about that by the way they had their
original cloud service that if your

177
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,459
company says we don't use cloud services
asking where your payroll your security

178
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,500
and all your benefits that is
application security still relatively

179
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,980
the same we're getting new cloud
intelligent WoW signal sciences shout

180
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,620
out those guys are awesome got some new
product this week we have to wear agents

181
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,860
we've seen the end point you have to
understand but in point has evolved

182
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,520
understand we're gonna have you know
totally surveillance infrastructure like

183
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,390
it was slammed some other code past kind
of layers and then you have all the rest

184
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:03,790
of this identity network administrator
relationships and rolls region ality of

185
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:11,240
your data that is only accessible 329
protected us such a trench here if he

186
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,290
has won five bucks after this Adrian
told that the first analyst I saw it

187
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,810
really got it and it was like you can
now push a button destroyed its owner

188
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,010
gary is that right

189
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:26,939
if the wrong person can get credentials
or can fish you goodnight

190
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:32,949
about your backups or in the cloud those
are gone to the top rating is nuts how

191
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:37,529
much bonuses on the people running up
the structure and not scare people the

192
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:40,729
people running infrastructure tend to be
people with not a ton of security

193
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:44,499
experience and not the battle scars that
a lot of people here how from making

194
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:48,349
mistakes and having do instant response
and crept over time so how do you can

195
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:53,689
bridge the gap toi make sense of
security code right

196
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:57,919
fifties a judgment services are
completely coat oriented on the back end

197
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,929
up hurting charger looks like is like a
JSON blob then we can actually build

198
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:07,470
automation round that contract knowing
that if what we do them chargers that

199
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,989
JSON is what comes out the other end up
riders are using automation to build

200
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:15,449
from that same day some blogs that we
create a one-to-one constructs and

201
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:21,039
security we say what I say is what I do
and when I say is what you do so now

202
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,989
that means watching the ship the
dynamism your environment

203
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:29,689
programmatically allows you to intercede
programmatically so it's not so by the

204
00:14:29,689 --> 00:14:34,299
way someone lost a bunch of Bitcoin
mining machines in a region in a package

205
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:38,978
in the morning it means a lot as a team
that I don't want to be launched

206
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:43,109
terminated immediately right don't paid
someone have a human wake up and go

207
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:47,919
loggins you think about what's wrong we
can articulate what security means the

208
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,449
cloud and we can actually order
programmatically which is something

209
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:55,539
we've not been able to effectively do
before totally basic example this is

210
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:58,539
Amazon Jason structure

211
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,380
side looks horrible on the screen sorry
fifty percent of the time we see people

212
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,730
who are building a rolling two images
talking about patch management the cloud

213
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,150
all these things

214
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,329
struggle with it and the reason I
struggle with it is how do you know what

215
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:17,330
should beware any point I'm humans are
horrible and going around looking like a

216
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,050
mi majorities and knowing which one
should be in every region because they

217
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,779
are different in every region that's
thinking Amazon they're different every

218
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,680
region they change as you roll out new
patches of you guys have an you know

219
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,270
like the SL issues that came out
recently you have often patarroyo

220
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:38,339
industry globally rollback out people
got sophisticated enough to actually

221
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:43,650
take and building my is using automation
and push them down on the back in the

222
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,630
security process is broken we have
successfully seen people start actually

223
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,430
integrate these audits and checks into
the CIC pipeline so why are actually

224
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,770
doing a build push of a new image not
only does it mark that is the new golden

225
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:02,230
image you know what's no longer in date
taken out a date you're taking other

226
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,400
infrastructure you also now concede
globally is anything running during the

227
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,189
life cycle this image that's not a prude
like you want to know how much happier I

228
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,450
get access to your cloud infrastructure
I'm not gonna launched a golden image

229
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,560
guys I'm not going to lunch the thing
that's got here you know cloud passage

230
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,540
agent has a chance I can give myself
away from the marketplace and launch it

231
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,810
and you never know there's no way for
you to actually track these things

232
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,709
actually looking for it you have a known
good state you can track against at the

233
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:34,969
same time you start talking like hey
what are the right security roles I can

234
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,250
apply to these assets and a server
machine is one thing you can do this

235
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,690
around an object store in history you
can do this around things you saw it was

236
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,470
objects story like these assets all have
roles and missions they're all equal

237
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,390
class citizens now that's actually a
really unique situation has never

238
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,370
happened before everything was
subservient to host so you go say hey

239
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,070
is someone using the right security
report and only that I can query back

240
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,420
when something happens to the security
group for all the relevant image ID's

241
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:09,199
and push a syllabus that security group
programmatically so now what you're

242
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,559
seeing is the trend where we know we
know what's not right non-compliance we

243
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:17,349
can take immediate reaction we can
actually start taking immediate defense

244
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:20,809
and immunization against our
environments we we can go and say this

245
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:23,839
event happen somewhere we want to
immunize the rest of our heard of

246
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,550
instances Amazon accounts
cross-functional teams are people that

247
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,379
are doing threat feeds on the Internet

248
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,760
consumed those and push for immediate
reaction to guard ourselves against

249
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,770
continued attacks and know how many
people here on Amazon or Google or a

250
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,520
jury raising ants so most people how
many people are programmatically

251
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,520
auditing your infrastructure at least an
hourly basis

252
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,300
good set of hands it's more than we've
actually seen a lot of times how many

253
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:55,340
people can take automated remedial
reaction based on that data awesome so

254
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,610
this is something that more people
should be aware of it's not instant

255
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,169
response the sense that a person does it
it's instant response in that you force

256
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:08,200
things into conformity through
programmatic action either insuring

257
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,110
things all this API data is relevant
across correlate against other known

258
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,110
good States and other pieces of your
infrastructure so hundreds of thousands

259
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:24,559
of API calls an asset such as you can
return this is one we can derive seven

260
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,899
or ten different security verifications
and compliance actions and it doesn't

261
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,730
stop there they case keep growing
there's always more first doing so good

262
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,710
to the topic rate the regularization of
your process you know I'm not gonna go

263
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,650
to talking to tell you guys how you
build code securely I'm not gonna tell

264
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,940
you guys how to build test and assets
and I can't tell you how to deploy gonna

265
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,679
tell you is that each of these steps
there's a place for security be part of

266
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,160
the DNA it's not supposed to be
something that comes at the end of the

267
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,040
deployment where someone has to come to
do an auditor skin as you're catching

268
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,659
things the development cycle to the test
cycle as it moves from depth has staged

269
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,020
you know prod

270
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,889
and in production before he promoted
from an ABA a blue-green deployment

271
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,510
stack you can actually in real time

272
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,220
failed built based on security
verifications on its checks whatever you

273
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,720
want to call them and in fact you can
actually create corrections to prevent

274
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,920
bills from failing so if you're billed
as to when you push out last week's

275
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,940
template for security groups and Amazon
see no you got real update since then

276
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,330
the only with a system that you built
catch this actually fix it failed to

277
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:31,110
build with a bunch of time by opening
tickets and having someone go up to the

278
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:35,379
template you can still do that remedial
reaction on the back and butt in line

279
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,200
you can fix and save a bill which is
something that securities never really

280
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,520
been well known for like we're not
always the hague I save something and

281
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,850
maybe go out the door faster this is the
time where security actual accelerates

282
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,850
things and you guys get a better seat at
the table

283
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,170
officially approached yeah this is where
we attacks of fun about examples of

284
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:57,490
things you know anyone here standing
like still on a weekly monthly quarterly

285
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:04,110
basis don't lie it's ok dirty laundry
that's fully acceptable for a lot of

286
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,290
people the funniest thing is a lot of
those scans mccloud world of the

287
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:11,730
pragmatic welder at a date by the time
the PDF is generated mail to you because

288
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,160
events change people are going to play
on an hourly basis right doesn't work in

289
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,580
dynamic environments

290
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,129
the new hot stocks continue scanning
real time for threats and a threat its

291
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,000
members boil it down someone making an
accidental mistake in the way they

292
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,500
structure their security posture leaving
11 attacks service is a threat against

293
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,430
the organization doesn't have to be the
scary people across the water doesn't

294
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:40,650
have to be you know the government
trying to infiltrate and Trojan your

295
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,370
software it can be anything as simple as
it could be because the threat is your

296
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,360
organization's at risk and will lose
reputation data and customers and

297
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,300
revenue if you aren't putting your best
foot forward at all times because a good

298
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,820
example overtime things happen then
things will happen in a monolithic sense

299
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,050
and identity change alone is not
generally security about that a lot of

300
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,330
people are too scared because it happens
but you correlate and identity change

301
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,790
and unapproved image lots of potentially
malicious

302
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,250
that shit holy trigger quarantine
because a sequence of events is a

303
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,820
pattern of attack

304
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,129
much like that of network packets is a
pattern of attack but these things

305
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,020
happen at the infrastructure level and
he bends that create change mutation

306
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,590
your environment they're not things that
are simply a chain of network packets

307
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,649
that come together that you had a recent
on the back end two totally different

308
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,350
way of proceeding what's happening and
then it's gone

309
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:39,500
the attackers of Jiva goal they changed
the policy on a particular file and

310
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,960
delete the instance and the identity
that was there how do you know it ever

311
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,520
existed this can happen with this
happens fascist 34 minutes people are

312
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,940
programmatic and they're fast and it's
really scared that you'll never know

313
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,430
what happened if you're not really
paying attention

314
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,040
new cloud monitoring tag you know what's
really cool things go out Netflix

315
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:06,360
credits red alert as a partner Scott to
work commercial products all disclaimer

316
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,530
and has a bunch of cool emerging things
are coming out that we're staying on top

317
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,550
of things really interesting things that
happen in the OSS commercial site here

318
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,220
definitely somebody gets you checking
out if you don't always build yourself

319
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:24,170
up some work other really good people
built single-purpose host based

320
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:29,250
technology not only is host based really
in danger right now the programmatic

321
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:33,500
Landis out containerization worked
really well like we could get away from

322
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,980
running operations at all sure a bunch
of people here would like that time back

323
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:43,250
patch management and all that other fun
hardening we're worried worried doing a

324
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:48,000
lot of it in source code Papa danceable
chef these things and all of a sudden

325
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,540
you think is a configuration state is
actually hardening its you know making

326
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:57,090
sure reducing ports operating and
guarantee secure traffic it's

327
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,419
dynamically pushing firewall change the
hosts level if you need to have it based

328
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,210
on everything as simple as area code
accounts coming out of my logs things

329
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:10,140
like 10 patching Hartley another great
excuse freed actually push security down

330
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,140
to these kinds of systems that can
really help

331
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,520
some good resources here once again this
will come back up about five seconds

332
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,990
before I kill that school grad pictures
look at his campaign manager communities

333
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:26,200
they're really starting to push security
hardware co security people are coming

334
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,720
to community rather than having to chase
us and that's actually an exciting time

335
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:37,340
man you ought it's like cool on right
there one likes to automate compliance

336
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:42,419
audit compliance yet how'd you like to
have a lot of that stuff happen on the

337
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,880
back end and you only get report that
people are fixing things that being mean

338
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,960
most everyone else we've seen auditors
come in and actually be able to go

339
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,530
through a set of data not only showing
where you are today as a as a proof

340
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,670
point to structured data from system as
minors on human telling him to have a

341
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:02,070
double check it for more evidence is the
evidence but also the proof that as we

342
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,610
deviate 95 but I'm working place in an
hour again because the system's actually

343
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:11,199
reflects ever get people involved fast
complaints over time is much better the

344
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,000
compliance in a fire drill and that's
what we've been trained to do

345
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,970
historically the small course
corrections make it a heck of alot

346
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:22,750
easier at the end of the year when you
have to recertify reactive behavior

347
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,730
which is where most of us spend a lot of
our time

348
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:31,170
automated defense totally I've been
alluding to the whole time I'm gonna

349
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,300
call rich motives are a lot of credit
because he was the first nunnally

350
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,260
analysts warn the first tech people I
saw that openly published the idea that

351
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,760
you can actually forcibly corrects
things that happened it shouldn't happen

352
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,500
unfortunately quarantine immense another
great piece of software you guys can

353
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,380
take and built on top of if you need to
articulate what should happen in what

354
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,780
should happen and guard against what
should happen programmatically is the

355
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,050
difference of fixing things in seconds
are spending much cleaning up after its

356
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,730
really is

357
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:08,370
getting rugged a journey this is kinda
last night he doesn't happen like as

358
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:11,209
much as we would like to buy it a box
and deployed how it's all of our

359
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,130
problems everyone his pragmatic enough
another we build and we made by our

360
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,310
technologies and build against them what
really happens here is we need to be

361
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:24,429
focusing on forcing the industry and
forcing the thinking to be not only give

362
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:28,520
me the functionality I need to allow me
to extend and build on top of it means a

363
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,030
cable security products are the thing
that although she pushed industry

364
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:37,170
towards not special you know specialized
Louisa things like that those things are

365
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,660
terrible you know automate the security
behaviour this goes back to the same

366
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,160
thing the environments to dynamic I
don't care how good everyone here is I

367
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,560
don't care how good I think I was in my
head a bunch of red blood had in me I

368
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,520
cannot react fast enough to the millions
of permutations of events that happen on

369
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,920
a daily basis on a common cloud
environment we have to shift our

370
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,970
thinking we have to lean back home we
know well which is technology and the

371
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:07,600
defense is that we understand and apply
these cloud environments and then this

372
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,590
is one will get a lot of losing cause I
encourage all of you go finder team

373
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:17,590
Rothstein and sit down for lunch and be
like how can I help you with security

374
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,659
how can I make it part of the process if
you can champion the marriage of these

375
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:26,530
two you know almost silos a lot of the
problems we face insecurity go away your

376
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,950
welcome a seat at the table you get more
honest answer is it's not adversarial

377
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:35,130
it's accelerating the business and what
ends up happening is the creation ships

378
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,120
and you create a perception of the
interesting information security

379
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,679
professional industry that spark
conversations and what comes from here

380
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,610
as conversations where we can all openly
talk and share more assets like the

381
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,250
assets I mentioned after various parts
this presentation and drive the

382
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,200
community forward because as good as we
all are individually in our in our

383
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,910
businesses were held a lot better
together special were fighting against

384
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:03,220
common cause i think thats it I don't
time thank you

385
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:13,330
jim thank you to sharing your valuable
knowledge and I'll be happy if it bit me

386
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:19,710
give you a gift and thank you for
joining today there's three things

387
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:25,080
announcements basically there is a drink
tickets available in the bar in the main

388
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,418
room and also a real food with
appetizers and there's also a raffle for

389
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:35,559
very high-end headphones so take a
chance thanks
