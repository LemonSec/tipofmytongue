1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
hi everyone

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,540
um I'm going to promise you one thing

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,819
before we start this talk this is going

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,039
to be different now you get to decide at

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,599
the end whether it's different good or

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,000
different bad that's another thing but

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,700
it's but it's it won't be the same as

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,560
other talks you'll see today because

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,960
mostly when we talk about security we

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,699
focus on the things that developers are

11
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,560
building but this talk is going to be

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
different it's going to be focused on

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,100
what your business users are building

14
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,680
and the kind of risks that that are

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,000
exposed by them building their own

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
applications

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,098
um

18
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,800
so briefly about me and why should you

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,200
listen to me about this space I've been

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,200
working on kind of trying to understand

21
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,000
the the implications the security

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,040
implications of local no code

23
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,780
applications those applications the

24
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,760
business users are building for the last

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,800
four years or so I founded a company

26
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,539
that's focused on this space called

27
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,360
generally I was part of the cloud

28
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,300
security team at Microsoft where I got

29
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,340
some initial conversibility into this

30
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,340
space there's an OS code dedicated to

31
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,500
top 10 full local no code we're going to

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,820
see some of it today if you're

33
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,119
interested please reach out afterwards

34
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,799
and I'm actually most of my time is

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
actually it's actually spent on the on

36
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,100
the red team side

37
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,740
figuring out how we can use these uh

38
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,360
these types of applications to hack the

39
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,979
Enterprise so if you're interested in

40
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,240
that there's a bunch more information

41
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,159
after it you can search for my Dev

42
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,220
contacts I gave a couple of them at the

43
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,960
last Defcon

44
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,060
um here's what we're going to do today

45
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,580
we're going to start by making sure

46
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,560
we're on the same page on what local

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,799
node code actually is and what is the

48
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,900
and how fast is going within the

49
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,460
Enterprise and I'm I'm hoping to

50
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,220
convince you that this is the kind of

51
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,100
case like uh bring your own device or

52
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,960
mobile applications where we can't

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,340
really say this isn't this doesn't

54
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,200
belong to us so this will not happen in

55
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,780
our org we just have to go along with it

56
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,960
we're gonna see how the sdrc translates

57
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,420
or how it doesn't translate to local no

58
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,299
code and then we're going to focus on

59
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,759
the top risks that we that we see these

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,740
applications exposing and this is going

61
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,139
to be

62
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,840
driven by scanning of of more than 100

63
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,120
000 of these types of patients through

64
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,640
my company and the oscoop

65
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,160
all right so we're going to start by

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,040
figuring out what local no code is and

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,739
why is it and its promise to make

68
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,780
everyone a developer and by everyone I

69
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,280
really mean everyone I mean people from

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,480
HR and and sales and marketing and

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,300
across the organization

72
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,099
this is kind of a joke but it's true

73
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,860
right business users or business needs

74
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,760
always outweigh the our capabilities to

75
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,920
actually answer those needs and this has

76
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,319
been a problem since forever we've been

77
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,220
uh I mean the business grows and the and

78
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,140
the rate of growth is is larger than

79
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,900
what it can provide and this is not only

80
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,940
about lack of developers it's not only

81
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,739
about kind of a shortage in the number

82
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,819
of developers it's it's just an inherent

83
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,580
inherent thing also kind of when you as

84
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,560
a business user when you want your your

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,959
need when you want something addressed

86
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,700
you know to convince people you need to

87
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,739
get the right attention

88
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,319
um and so you end up waiting and so this

89
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,840
is what local tries to solve and if this

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,300
sounds like something that is uh that is

91
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,099
not new that's actually that kind of

92
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,980
you've heard before it is not it's not

93
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,780
new at all it's actually part of a

94
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,879
larger Trend that we've had uh through

95
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,000
many years now that's kind of about I.T

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,519
decentralization about the capability of

97
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,200
the business units to operate on their

98
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,379
own without centralizing and there were

99
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,000
many different Innovations in the past

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,620
that have actually achieved this the

101
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,260
number one thing that people think about

102
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,060
um I encourage you to think about kind

103
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,580
of when you think about what is the how

104
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,200
how do um how fast can this go is things

105
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,260
like Excel or office so Excel has been

106
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,959
like the number one tool of the like the

107
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,580
single tool that I've been using across

108
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,200
my career no matter how much I've

109
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,180
learned the other things uh think about

110
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,400
the number of jobs that are centered

111
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,500
around Excel this is the ultimate local

112
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,139
NOCO tool and of course Excel came with

113
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,779
the with macros which are kind of our

114
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,358
close friends until until today so low

115
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,180
code is just another iteration on these

116
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,800
capabilities that are about empowering

117
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,780
business users or empowering everyone to

118
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,639
build applications faster

119
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,699
and when we think about it this way it's

120
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,680
easier to understand where where is it

121
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,840
going so it's going for it's going to a

122
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,940
place where business where the business

123
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,540
operates independently and it can be

124
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,360
left outside of the conversation now one

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,340
thing that it's important for us to

126
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,320
figure out is to have just a few it's

127
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,820
important for us for the conversation to

128
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,919
have a few concrete examples of

129
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,540
applications that were built by business

130
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,120
teams or were built with local no codes

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,540
so we all agree uh or we have something

132
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,180
to think about when we when we consider

133
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,040
these applications so let me show you a

134
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,180
few of them

135
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,800
here's one this is actually an example

136
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,199
for Microsoft if you go and visit of or

137
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,600
if you went and visit Microsoft Office

138
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,180
says physically uh doing during the

139
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,060
pandemic and you had to uh you had to

140
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,040
provide your uh copied vaccination proof

141
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,900
this was facilitated through a local app

142
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,120
so you open up this this is just a web

143
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,220
portal you open it up you need to upload

144
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,139
your your copy the certificate of course

145
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,780
this means that this is handling a

146
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,180
health data right now who's building

147
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,979
this app it could be professional

148
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,419
developers with low code it could be

149
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,300
business users for sure it's uh but but

150
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,520
the main point is that it's built with

151
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,320
low currents and it's kind of a it's a

152
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,919
critical app and in most cases these are

153
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,720
not really covered by the security

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,979
umbrella but we'll touch on that in a

155
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,240
moment

156
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,120
here's another example this is a famous

157
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,900
example by uh wokato and slack and so

158
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,060
slack is a big volcato customer is an

159
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,220
integration platform and they are using

160
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,500
a bunch of vocado automation to

161
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,419
facilitate everything from the order to

162
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,880
Cache processes this is of course

163
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,740
critical right there cannot be any

164
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,639
mistakes here and um and wokato has to

165
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,820
be dealt with as a production as a

166
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,380
production environment or a Production

167
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,900
Service in this in this matter

168
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,539
now let's see another one which would be

169
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,759
a bit different this is another example

170
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,919
for Microsoft but this time the

171
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,020
developer here is clearly a business

172
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,319
user so here's the use case here there's

173
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,940
the marketing team there that is in

174
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,800
charge of product launches and they

175
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,479
found out that there were several

176
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,520
different processes ongoing in parallel

177
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
to actually go through those product

178
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,880
launches so they created an app that

179
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,860
facilitated this process that allowed

180
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,080
everybody to kind of go through the same

181
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,120
kind of the same steps to launch their

182
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,819
product this app was developed by the

183
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,060
marketing team very quickly and became

184
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,819
the go to app to work on that process so

185
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,940
it's like the it's the official app for

186
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,020
everybody that wants to launch

187
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,300
applications

188
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,620
and again this is built by a business

189
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,620
user this is really well this is really

190
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,560
cool but now let's think about all of

191
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,120
the gates all of the all of the security

192
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
controls everything that we have for

193
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,020
professional development and whether or

194
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,599
not this this applies here

195
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,120
um now one thing you could be thinking

196
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,220
right now in order to get yourself out

197
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,620
of the hook is that uh this doesn't

198
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,900
doesn't apply to your organization that

199
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,580
you never have business maybe you're a

200
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,560
bank or financial service or something

201
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,240
and you're thinking well in my

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,740
organization we'll never let business

203
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,599
users build it build things on their own

204
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,120
and I'm sorry to be the one to say this

205
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,300
but uh that's a very difficult task to

206
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,479
achieve these things are already there

207
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,479
within most Enterprises because low code

208
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,300
is being packaged into existing SAS

209
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,039
products and

210
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,560
kind of just show me there aren't many

211
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,720
Enterprises that don't have one of these

212
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,500
vendors as a a kind of a deployed in the

213
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,639
organization and there are of course

214
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,360
others every SAS platform today is

215
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,099
baking in those local no code

216
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,139
capabilities as a way to extend their

217
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,660
platform but it also means that these

218
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,419
are no longer single applications so

219
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,300
thinking about office 265 or about

220
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,360
Salesforce as a point solution is is

221
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,280
kind of outdated Salesforce is no longer

222
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,900
a CRM it's an application development

223
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,879
platform and we are not really treating

224
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,360
it this treating it that way in most

225
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,760
cases so if you're using one of those

226
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,559
platforms these are tools that are

227
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,899
already packaged inside and that and

228
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,940
they are shipped directly to business

229
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,940
users there's no asking for permission

230
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,760
in that process this means that in a

231
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,040
typical Enterprise that I got to work

232
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,100
with even though they did not have an

233
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,260
official kind of Citizen development or

234
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,779
Business Development initiative they did

235
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,120
they had tens of thousands of these

236
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,440
applications and I'll show you the

237
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,300
statistics in a moment

238
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,019
um

239
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,540
when you ask the people when you when

240
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,100
you watch what people that are leading

241
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,200
this space are talking about they are

242
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,140
talking about it as as the next big wave

243
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,480
of application building

244
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,760
here are a couple of quotes uh you can

245
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,220
see a quotes from uh from analysts you

246
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,080
can but the more interesting one is

247
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
actually the quote for Microsoft which

248
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,360
is sharing kind of their goal in this

249
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,940
space they're basically saying well we

250
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,500
need to build so many apps in the

251
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,720
industry developers won't be able to do

252
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,060
it so local is the way to to move

253
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,459
forward now if we think about the fact

254
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,800
that these applications are a very easy

255
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,920
to build be more people can build those

256
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,080
applications well pretty soon we're

257
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,700
going to be in a situation where most

258
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,860
apps in terms of numbers will be built

259
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,959
with local will be built outside of our

260
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,720
I.T those could be small apps but they

261
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,760
still have identity they still move data

262
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,260
they still they still have those

263
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,300
operations that they they are doing and

264
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,200
so it's kind of important for us

265
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,700
failing to put them under the security

266
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,560
umbrella would leave us in a very tough

267
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,980
situation now one thing I mean these are

268
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,560
these are quotes that talk about the

269
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,320
future but the more interesting about is

270
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,940
whether what are they actually truthful

271
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,800
whatever they are what is the situation

272
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,279
today so I want you to say so one

273
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,500
statistic that I uh checked kind of a

274
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,680
week before or a few days earlier uh is

275
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,360
how many dot-net developers there are

276
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,399
right now and according to Microsoft

277
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,440
there are over 5 million so I'll take

278
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,200
that as meaning less than six

279
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,480
um compared to that number that's the

280
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,940
number today right how many local

281
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,800
developers just using the Microsoft

282
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,779
ecosystem do you think they are

283
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,940
just kind of think about it have a have

284
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,500
some sort of a

285
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,260
some sort of an answer

286
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,360
all right so I just I went through

287
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,839
Microsoft's uh earning reports for the

288
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,120
last few years well they mentioned here

289
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,620
in delcom the number of developers that

290
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,019
are using the local local platform and

291
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,339
of course this is just Microsoft because

292
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,560
that information is out there but the

293
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,720
market is much bigger than them

294
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,300
he'll hear the statistics so they

295
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,680
started off with their low code

296
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,560
initiative in 2018

297
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,820
in 2020 so in 20 in 2022 they uh

298
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,040
publicly mentioned that they have more

299
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,200
than seven million developers that are

300
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,720
using their local local platform and you

301
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,019
can see the kind of uh the linear

302
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,760
regression that I that I've created here

303
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,040
which puts them kind of the prediction

304
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,500
is that today they are about 8 million

305
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,720
but even if you take the 7 million

306
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,880
number there are more low code no code

307
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,500
developers on the Microsoft ecosystem

308
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,959
than.net developers this when I saw this

309
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,540
this kind of really surprised me because

310
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,579
we are still thinking of this as a we

311
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,440
might be thinking of this as a niche

312
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,300
thing but it's definitely not right

313
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,120
think about all of the uh all of the

314
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,860
control of all of the effort that we put

315
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,380
in place to help those.net developers

316
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,120
avoid mistakes to make sure that the

317
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,380
applications that they are building is

318
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,660
are secured how much effort are we

319
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,240
putting into uh helping those local noko

320
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,880
Developers not a comparable amount at

321
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,899
all

322
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,019
all right so this is these are

323
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,720
statistics for the entire Microsoft

324
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
development ecosystem but the more

325
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,940
important thing for each one of us is

326
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,800
how does it look like for a single

327
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,600
organization so for our Organization for

328
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,540
typical large Enterprise how many

329
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,100
applications are actually being

330
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,959
developed by these types of platforms

331
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,140
and so so let me show you an example and

332
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,540
this would be uh this would be numbers

333
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,279
from kind of a real company just

334
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,880
anonymized uh and and and they represent

335
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,820
again a single organization

336
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,540
again from launch in 2019 and 2018 you

337
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,320
can see how the graph goes uh it's about

338
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,500
kind of a quadratic growth there you can

339
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,860
see that very that in in an amount of

340
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,620
something like two years they they have

341
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,660
built about 65 000 applications 65 000

342
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,120
applications these are numbers that are

343
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,880
unprecedented right nobody has is

344
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,920
building so many professional developed

345
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,620
application now of course many of these

346
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,880
applications or even most of the

347
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,980
applications are very simple they could

348
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,079
be like an if this then that rule or

349
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,480
they could be a single application that

350
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,120
only a user is used or maybe somebody

351
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,800
built an application and never even used

352
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,720
it it doesn't really matter these

353
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,820
applications still have an identity they

354
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,519
still have the ability to move data and

355
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,320
they are built on top of business data

356
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,820
by definition because they are built

357
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,040
with these SAS platforms that already

358
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,440
hold your business data okay so that's

359
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,779
why it's important to get on top of this

360
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,220
quickly because the number of

361
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,079
applications that are developed is

362
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,240
growing really really really fast and

363
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,040
again when you think about when you see

364
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,980
this chart it it becomes easier to

365
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,720
believe that indeed most applications

366
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,760
most business applications in the near

367
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,380
future would be applications built by

368
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,000
the business rather than applications

369
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,459
built by it simply because of the the of

370
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,079
these large numbers

371
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,720
all right so here's a quick recap of

372
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,480
what we've seen so far a we've seen that

373
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,700
this is a this is a big boost in

374
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,980
productivity that is expected to have

375
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,079
all at least the people that are driving

376
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,480
it wanted to have at least an Excel

377
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,639
level impact we're talking about uh

378
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,260
business critical applications that are

379
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,880
built built here not all of them but

380
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,880
some of them and this is again available

381
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,459
in every major Enterprise and it doesn't

382
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,320
really matter whether we choose to

383
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,779
enable It or Not by default it's already

384
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,040
there right so one thing we need to to

385
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,160
look at one thing we need to understand

386
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,480
to in order to understand the kind of

387
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,820
risks that these applications expose is

388
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,639
how are they being developed so what is

389
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,579
the stlc how does the sdlc look like for

390
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,339
these local apps and so let me show you

391
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,800
an example of one application and once

392
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,779
and this will kind of play out in the

393
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,180
background but this is a very concealed

394
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,980
example what I'm doing here is

395
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,079
essentially I'm trying to fix my own

396
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,180
problem in my organization we're using

397
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,399
slack and there's this feature in slack

398
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,660
where somebody can mention you on a

399
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,480
public Channel and then there's this uh

400
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,000
you're expected to reply really quickly

401
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,399
right which is kind of annoying so what

402
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,260
I'm doing here is I'm using an

403
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,480
Automation in the API where every time

404
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,699
somebody mentions being on slack I'll

405
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:33,260
change my status as if I want to call

406
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,260
because that helps and then five minutes

407
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,300
later I'm going to change my status back

408
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,399
to uh to available so nobody would

409
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,260
suspect me

410
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,000
okay this is this is really cool because

411
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,279
it's it's it's showing you

412
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,380
actually a really sophisticated upload

413
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,000
application that are building through

414
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,519
zapier here and it's also drag and drop

415
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,899
this entire video takes about two

416
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,240
minutes but just think about the level

417
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,180
of complexity that this application uh

418
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,300
is it needs to handle it needs to uh

419
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,579
reach out to it needs to authenticate to

420
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,980
slack it needs to store some sort of a

421
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,620
secret right it needs to subscribe to

422
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,360
webhook on the slides on the slack side

423
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,660
needs to support API changes buy slack

424
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,699
it needs to have a state because this

425
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,620
delay step waiting five minutes I mean

426
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,480
somebody needs to to wake up after that

427
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,339
this is a significant piece of software

428
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,800
and I'm able to build it simply with

429
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,139
drag and drop now

430
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:30,180
um take this process that you're seeing

431
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,579
right now and compare it to the sdlc

432
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,800
I mean when I'm when I'm finish here and

433
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,120
you'll see it in a moment they will be

434
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,220
I'll have like a nice little pop-up that

435
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,339
would say uh publish app that's it right

436
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:45,740
some of the platforms would even

437
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,300
automatically save applications as you

438
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,579
build them and deploy them to production

439
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,360
right this is a really this is a really

440
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,660
big challenge because these and because

441
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,759
this this means that everything that

442
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,399
we've baked into the sdlc doesn't really

443
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,980
apply here it gets put pushed out of the

444
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,780
way now one thing I will mention which

445
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,400
is important is that in some cases

446
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,500
professional development teams are using

447
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,280
low code with an stlc but uh they're

448
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,839
they're doing this kind of despite of

449
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,319
existing capabilities not

450
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,059
their life is not easy at all

451
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:21,780
um

452
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,040
so

453
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,339
going into the sdlc again this is just

454
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,919
kind of vanilla stlc and this is the

455
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,179
typical thing that we have for

456
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:31,679
professional development of course this

457
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,559
could vary a lot but I'm trying to make

458
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,880
a point here about the law about low

459
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,980
code let's compare it to what you've

460
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,840
just seen

461
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,280
so

462
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,220
there's no real process here there's a

463
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,200
single user that thinks about the

464
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,120
problem and then solves that problem

465
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,299
that means that one there's no exchange

466
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,520
of hands between different uh different

467
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,340
people there's no there doesn't have to

468
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,340
be any planning any monitoring you can

469
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,080
think about what happens if one of these

470
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,480
apps get hacked will your stock even be

471
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,760
able to identify it will it be able to

472
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,100
if if it was identified will it be able

473
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,720
to actually do something with it

474
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,660
investigate it I I'm not sure and more

475
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,919
than that

476
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,679
um this entire process is up to the

477
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,480
business user now the important thing to

478
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,860
note here is that this is a good thing

479
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,960
this is the feature that is driving this

480
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,880
platform this is the reason why we have

481
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,620
so many apps because it's easy to create

482
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,780
those apps so this is not going to be

483
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,500
easily solved right and one other thing

484
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,880
that you could be thinking about to get

485
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,740
yourself off the hook is that this is

486
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,200
the platform's fault is that the

487
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,700
platforms that are building that are

488
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,140
allowing users to build these things

489
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,780
they should fix the problem so I'm not

490
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,340
really sure about that because there's

491
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,240
something called The Shadow

492
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,860
responsibility model we've learned this

493
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,960
in the cloud already you can't expect a

494
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,700
cloud provider to solve your problems

495
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,400
for you when you build an app on top of

496
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,380
a platform you're in charge of that of

497
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,400
that app

498
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,500
the platform is in charge of making

499
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,720
secure building blocks allowing you to

500
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,340
use the platform in a secure way but

501
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,380
when you build something you own that

502
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,299
thing including the security risk of

503
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:07,559
that thing

504
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,160
okay so that and and in my kind of what

505
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,080
I'm trying to convince you here is that

506
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,380
this must be our problem because nobody

507
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,299
else would fix it for us

508
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,940
and with that the next part or the rest

509
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,340
of this talk is going to be focused on

510
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,799
the type of the types of problems that

511
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,539
we're seeing when these applications

512
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,400
actually get developed

513
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,760
um and and what you're going to see when

514
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,000
when we go through this the top 10 here

515
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,059
is that is concrete examples of how

516
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,640
these applications go wrong now before I

517
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,620
show you the actual list

518
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,720
um a few words about about this this

519
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,700
project this project started about two

520
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,620
and a half years ago today there's a

521
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,600
community of about 200 people that are

522
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,640
because they instead of joined kind of

523
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,440
the different channels there

524
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,400
um these are mostly large Enterprises

525
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,320
that are part of this group and if

526
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,059
you're interested we're working on the

527
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,200
new version of the 2023 or current 23

528
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,640
version of the top 10 so if you're

529
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,900
interested we're really looking for

530
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,720
feedback reviewers uh Reach Out we'd be

531
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,360
happy to to kind of get you involved

532
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,440
um

533
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,840
this community is not only about the top

534
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,700
10 we're also we're also doing things

535
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,679
that are more on the red teaming side

536
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,179
you'll find a bunch of tools that you

537
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,880
can pen test your applications with so

538
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,679
if you're interested either go to the

539
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,179
link so reach out to me afterwards I'm

540
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,500
happy to direct you

541
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,980
all right this entire top 10 this entire

542
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,620
the entire top 10 list is built on is

543
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,179
based on the applications that we're

544
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:40,500
actually seeing in the world so the

545
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,860
applications that are that will build by

546
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,780
business teams inside of the

547
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,400
organizations that are part of this uh

548
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,840
the overscope

549
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,240
this is the top 10 and the top 10 here

550
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,220
is again different from the kind of

551
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,919
regular top 10 for web apps and it's

552
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,799
focused on the business logic that these

553
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,960
applications are present so it's not

554
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,299
about the the specific building block

555
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,980
this is the platform's fault no this is

556
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,100
all focused on your own on your on your

557
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,320
part on the organization's part of the

558
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,179
Shadow responsibility model

559
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,120
all right

560
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,679
the first problem that we're seeing

561
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,020
again again these local platforms is a

562
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,260
counterpersonation think about let's put

563
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,240
yourself in the in the in the shoes of a

564
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,280
local platform that's trying to expand

565
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,580
in the uh inside of the Enterprise again

566
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,860
without asking for permission what would

567
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,080
be the number one thing that would make

568
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,020
this uh graph that we saw earlier uh

569
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,120
kind of not not exist it would block

570
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,340
this graph to block this growth the

571
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,960
number of one thing that would block you

572
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,799
is permissions right if a user has to

573
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,539
ask for permission every time they

574
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,220
create an app you would never see this

575
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,860
golf that would never happen so how do

576
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,720
you circumvent that how do you allow

577
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,059
somebody from the HR team to build an

578
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,659
app without asking for a service account

579
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:03,120
you allow them to use your own to use

580
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,520
their own identity and so the way that

581
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,620
these platforms work the way that these

582
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,020
platforms go around this problem is that

583
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,940
they actually copy the user's refresh

584
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,760
tokens and then replay them as part of

585
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,600
the app

586
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,400
which means that actually they are

587
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,620
completely breaking the oauth model or

588
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,419
the permission model that we're used to

589
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,299
inside of the organization many of these

590
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,340
Integrations are actually built on top

591
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,620
of user impersonation so we user logs in

592
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,780
I copy the token and then I replay it I

593
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,400
also allow that user to share that token

594
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,919
but we'll see it in a moment now one

595
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,539
other thing that typically happens is

596
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,520
that when somebody Builds an application

597
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,440
it could be an important application a

598
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,380
useful application they embed their own

599
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,600
identity within that application through

600
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,640
these refresh tokens and now when I

601
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,740
share this application with you you can

602
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,200
use it but underlying you're using my

603
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,020
own identity now who cares right it

604
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,960
works well let me show let me share a

605
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,000
story with you of what could happen so

606
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,740
this is a real story where a customer

607
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,799
care team in a large organization they

608
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,080
basically they had a problem where

609
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,500
people didn't have access to the right

610
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,380
um to information about customers when

611
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,780
they were part of a of a support ticket

612
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,880
and so the way that they sell it is that

613
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,100
they created an application that used

614
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,280
the assembly from the kelston for the

615
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
customer care team use their own their

616
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,539
own user to go to the customer database

617
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,340
and fetch information about that

618
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,380
specific customer and they did bake

619
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,240
role-based Access Control into the app

620
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,480
itself right so the app only exposes the

621
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,900
customers that you are that you that you

622
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,080
related to so employees are happy right

623
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,640
because they can provide more

624
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,620
information to to they can do their job

625
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,480
better customers are happy because they

626
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,580
get better service customer care team is

627
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,559
happy because they fix their problem uh

628
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,080
who's who's not happy

629
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,840
the sock uh think about it from the

630
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,900
socks perspective right this is not an

631
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,380
app this is just I don't know scraping

632
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,059
inside of the organization this is a

633
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,620
bunch of a bunch of these different

634
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,080
requests across the Enterprise going

635
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,260
through multiple queries multiple IPS of

636
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,760
different across time they're using the

637
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,080
same credentials which are admin

638
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,419
credentials to the database right and

639
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,280
and this was actually caught by uh by

640
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,900
kind of abnormal activities that that

641
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,880
will cut inside the stock and just

642
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,880
imagine the so-called that needs to try

643
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,159
and handle this it took them some time

644
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,200
to find that this is actually an

645
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,400
application

646
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,620
and who's built this application and

647
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,600
then the second has reached out to the

648
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,039
person on the customer care team imagine

649
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,440
that conversation right not an easy

650
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,740
conversation now of course kind of this

651
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,960
is it's obvious why this is a problem

652
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,080
right you're baking in an identity to an

653
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,419
application uh and everybody can use

654
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:52,679
that identity

655
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:54,780
um underlying and even though in this

656
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,700
specific case role-based access control

657
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,460
was was was baked into the app in many

658
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,620
cases that doesn't happen some platforms

659
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,600
even have an ocean of uh that they call

660
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,820
implicit sharing which essentially means

661
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,340
when I share an application with you you

662
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,500
get direct access to the underlying data

663
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
sets even if I revoke access to the app

664
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,120
afterwards you still get access to the

665
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,980
to those data sets and so let's see

666
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,900
where that could take us and this would

667
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,720
be the second thing the second top 10

668
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,240
here which is about authorization now

669
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,000
problems with authorization have uh

670
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,039
they're not new this there's nothing new

671
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,080
about low code here the only thing

672
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,179
that's new is that this is has become

673
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,000
much much much easier because local

674
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,039
platforms are essentially credentials

675
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,720
doing credential sharing as a service

676
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,159
they are providing you with a service

677
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,140
that allow you to share your

678
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,360
authentication to share your identity

679
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,279
with other users within the organization

680
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,039
these are snapshots of uh different

681
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,720
platforms you're seeing uh Power

682
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,460
automate by Microsoft JPL and volcato

683
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,440
this is not picking them to them

684
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,059
specifically others are doing this as

685
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:57,840
well

686
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,720
the whole Heaven notion called kind of a

687
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,820
default environment or a default uh

688
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,520
convert or default folder and in this

689
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,799
default environment what you'll find is

690
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,779
credentials connections that have been

691
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,059
shared across your entire organization

692
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,559
and when I say across your entire

693
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,779
organization I mean everybody in your

694
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,000
Aid tenant that would include guests for

695
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,039
example and this is a single click away

696
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,960
when you create those connections now

697
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,299
what can a connection be you can see you

698
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,740
you might be able to see on the slides

699
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,360
here a few examples but in many

700
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,279
organizations we're seeing connections

701
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,120
to people's own Outlook and teams and

702
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,279
users we're seeing FTP servers SQL

703
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,440
servers this could also reach out onto

704
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,440
on-prem through gateways and so there

705
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,720
are this is just basically a lateral

706
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,340
movement waiting to happen right if I

707
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,520
get access to any user in the in in the

708
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,900
organization I can reach out to those

709
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,120
platforms and just find those

710
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,740
connections that are waiting for me to

711
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,419
use and we actually have a bunch of

712
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,279
tools that could help you identify this

713
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,440
within your organization I'll give links

714
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,779
to them afterwards

715
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,700
one other thing that we're seeing with

716
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,380
the with authorization

717
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,279
is basically this people are API

718
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,140
permissions are can be somewhat

719
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,880
difficult especially if you're not an

720
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,620
expert or if you're not a professional

721
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,659
developer and then in many cases what

722
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,419
we're seeing is that all of the users of

723
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,279
an app get provisioned with the same

724
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,500
permissions admin level permissions but

725
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,720
then they hide the different screen the

726
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,120
administrative screens on the UI side on

727
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,799
the client side this is very common for

728
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,059
example with Salesforce development

729
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,159
we've seen this again and again and so

730
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,900
here of course the problem is obvious

731
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,840
right but this is not something that you

732
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,360
think about unless you're aware of the

733
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,140
risks and and we've been uh kind of in

734
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,059
recent years there were there we've

735
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,100
gotten a long way with professional

736
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,159
developers becoming better equipped to

737
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,260
work around security business users are

738
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,700
not there I'm not sure we can expect

739
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,320
them to be them

740
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,020
okay let's go to the next one

741
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,620
um there are multiple ways in which we

742
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,500
are trying as Enterprises to to block

743
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,720
data leakage outside of the org and one

744
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,100
of the things that we've been trying to

745
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,799
block since forever is uh emails going

746
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,980
outside of the organization right so

747
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,039
um for example uh one very popular thing

748
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,240
to do for all of us is to get the

749
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,400
corporate email invites to our personal

750
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,320
Gmail account because it's it's much

751
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,360
it's much more comfortable now

752
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,120
organizations are trying to uh to combat

753
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,039
to to to block this and the way that

754
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:34,380
they do it could be through DLP

755
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,240
solutions could be through something on

756
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,460
the email server but here's what's

757
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,860
happening with local platforms instead

758
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,700
of

759
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,799
forwarding an email instead of doing

760
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,900
anything that would work over the

761
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,860
network

762
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,620
which would allow a network parameter uh

763
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,440
Appliance to to to help you they are

764
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,419
simply connecting with one hand with one

765
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,820
account to the corporate account and

766
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,140
with the other hand with another account

767
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,419
to the personal Gmail account and then

768
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,120
copying the content and this copy

769
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,539
operation is being done on the SAS

770
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,760
platform that is owned by the vendor you

771
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,140
don't have an agent there there's no way

772
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,360
for you to monitor it so again this is a

773
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,279
clear way to explore data outside of the

774
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,320
organization there hasn't been a single

775
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,539
org that I worked with that didn't have

776
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,640
some form of this happened happen inside

777
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,520
of the old this could be about email

778
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,460
this could be about

779
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,980
moving data between different

780
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,600
drives so a SharePoint and a Google

781
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,760
Drive for example and we also see in

782
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,340
many cases that people could build a

783
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,919
useful application and then just use the

784
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,440
wrong data set database as the database

785
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,000
of that application instead of storing

786
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,799
it in a couple database they'll store it

787
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,020
in their own personal one uh OneDrive

788
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,299
for example Excel they will access it

789
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,580
one other thing that could happen

790
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,260
is that these applications could be used

791
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,840
to do kind of malicious things so for

792
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,000
example this is a this is an example of

793
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,340
a ransomware for a specific SharePoint

794
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,799
site so I'm iterating over the entire

795
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,260
SharePoint site and for each file I'm

796
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,480
simply encrypting that file with the

797
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,640
encryption function that is provided by

798
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,620
the platform and overriding it within

799
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,360
within the site now SharePoint has

800
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,760
backups but this this same thing Could

801
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,880
Happen uh on on an on-prem machine

802
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,620
through the on-prem connection of those

803
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,779
types of platforms and this is just one

804
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,779
case but it we see in many cases where

805
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,600
these platforms by mistake cause harm so

806
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,100
there might be conflicting automations

807
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,559
that are overriding some files and then

808
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,360
things get changed and you need to walk

809
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,620
your way through those types of

810
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,240
applications again with no visibility

811
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,340
into it

812
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,559
one other problem that we're seeing is

813
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,659
authentication and secure communication

814
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,960
and this is this is this a silly one but

815
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,600
the power of these platforms is based on

816
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,399
the fact that they can connect across

817
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,679
your Enterprise They Come built in with

818
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,720
hundreds of different connectors that

819
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,640
connect to SAS and on-prem and others

820
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,740
and other places as well and when you

821
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,260
create those connections you as the

822
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,880
business user you're in charge of

823
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,580
configuring them correctly so one thing

824
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,140
that we've seen which is kind of weird

825
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,940
because this is something we should we

826
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,039
we thought we solved already is the

827
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,260
connections to FTP that are using FTP

828
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,260
either ftps and again this is up to the

829
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,179
plot to the user to decide the business

830
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,340
user they they can't really do that on

831
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,419
their own

832
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:24,659
okay let me show you another another

833
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,240
thing uh which is pretty common which is

834
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,520
misconfiguration this has been a huge

835
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,520
thing in Cloud for the last for recent

836
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,140
years and one of the things that you

837
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,520
should that be that you should be

838
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,899
thinking about when you think about

839
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,600
misconfiguration as an example is the S

840
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,059
is the open S3 bucket problem with AWS

841
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:45,779
right so AWS has recently uh changed the

842
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,279
default and made it very difficult for

843
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,960
you to open up these buckets but we

844
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,120
still have open buckets with a person

845
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,460
with private corporate information out

846
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,899
there because people are making mistakes

847
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,820
and so it's not only about the default

848
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,460
it's also about helping people not make

849
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,279
mistakes and so let me show you how this

850
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:05,159
pops up again with low code this is an

851
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,799
example from a Microsoft's platform they

852
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,080
have something called podolabs which is

853
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,640
the which is an application that is

854
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,399
basically creating a web app for you and

855
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,120
it allows Anonymous users so users that

856
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,220
are unregistered not logged in to go

857
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,659
into the website because well it's it's

858
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:22,880
a website

859
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,059
another feature that it has is an API it

860
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,399
is a basically an API endpoint that it

861
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,440
sets up for you that allows you to query

862
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,480
all the different tables behind this

863
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,120
behind this application now the problem

864
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,640
was that the default configuration was

865
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,320
that every user including Anonymous

866
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,640
users could access every table in the

867
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,659
Behind these applications through this

868
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,120
API and this was actually this was

869
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,159
actually a problem identified again

870
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,200
about a year and a half ago where the

871
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,720
default was like this and so it was very

872
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,480
easy to find the to find the information

873
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,980
that should not be exposed to everyone

874
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,380
just through randomly querying those

875
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,919
applications and so even though the

876
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,480
problem has been fixed by Microsoft the

877
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,000
default setting has been changed this is

878
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,380
still happening so let me show an

879
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,880
example from last year and this is a

880
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,460
real example this is a product for a

881
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,320
company a financial industry company in

882
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,039
the US you can see we've we found this

883
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,260
specific portal for that application for

884
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,059
that company I'll share with you in a

885
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,580
moment how and then when you query this

886
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,100
API you get a list of all the tables

887
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,260
that you can query through the API so

888
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,120
the default table doesn't have anything

889
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,399
interesting entity forms is just form

890
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,799
submissions Global variables is kind of

891
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,899
interesting right

892
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:41,460
so of course it has authentication

893
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,940
tokens to uh to Azure and to uh other

894
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,399
services and this was of course this

895
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,080
close to the to the specific company

896
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,299
where we found this but one of the but

897
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,880
but the main problem here and maybe I'll

898
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,860
go back a few slides so you can figure

899
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,559
this out on your own look at this domain

900
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,539
name all of these applications are

901
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,720
stored in our hopes are served in

902
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,460
different sub-domains of this domain so

903
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,099
just enumerate this domain enumerate

904
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,540
these different sub domains go to this

905
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,460
endpoint and it's very easy to find

906
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,800
those configurations to

907
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,599
misconfigurations are very much

908
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,918
predictable which makes this a huge

909
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,098
problem

910
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:20,820
okay

911
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,580
another thing that we uh that we see pop

912
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,199
up with the local platforms is injection

913
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,020
injection attacks or inject more

914
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,879
injection surface now this could be a

915
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,500
tricky one because platforms would tell

916
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,418
you that injection has been solved

917
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:34,980
because you're using widgets that are

918
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,080
provided by the platform but if you take

919
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,320
uh input from a user and you plug it

920
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,199
into a a

921
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,300
SQL a SQL query that goes out to your

922
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,179
SQL server and you don't sanitize it on

923
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,280
the way then then you have created an

924
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,320
injection surface and again because this

925
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,580
is something that business users are

926
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,619
doing or that people that are not part

927
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,060
of the security

928
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,040
umbrella are doing then you're not in a

929
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,720
really good position to help them catch

930
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,220
it

931
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,260
another problem that is surfacing here

932
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,660
again is a supply chain

933
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,640
the only reason why low code is

934
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,280
successful is because there's a bunch of

935
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,500
tools you can pick up and use from a

936
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,960
Marketplace in order to build your

937
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,940
application there are widgets there are

938
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,099
connectors which are kind of wrappers

939
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,440
around apis

940
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,480
there are different back-end operators

941
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,400
that you could use all of those things

942
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,160
some of them are built by the platform

943
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,020
themselves but all of the different all

944
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,000
of the large platform vendors have a

945
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,460
Marketplace if you think that they are

946
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,220
doing uh that they are completely owning

947
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,200
the risk of all of the components in

948
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,640
their Marketplace you're absolutely

949
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,820
wrong they might do a single review but

950
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,680
they cannot review every change of each

951
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,540
one of those widgets and also in many

952
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,339
cases the way in which you're using

953
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,220
those different cell party widgets is

954
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,540
that you can just pick them up from

955
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,820
GitHub or something like a zip file and

956
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,500
then you upload it somewhere there's no

957
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,800
hashing there's nothing okay so the

958
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,579
problem of uh supply chain attacks is is

959
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:09,960
very is kind of is very difficult to

960
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,180
find and and actually identify within

961
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,380
those local platforms and again it's

962
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,660
baked in because local platforms without

963
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,420
third party widgets would would really

964
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,940
don't have a lot of value in them

965
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,780
foreign

966
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,060
let me show you another kind of example

967
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,920
that we're seeing a lot and this is

968
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,680
about sensitive data sensitive data and

969
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,560
sensitive and sensitive

970
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,520
and secrets and so here's an example an

971
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,740
app that uses some sort of sensitive

972
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,440
data a user submits that sensitive data

973
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,780
to the app and then the app stores the

974
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,700
sensitive data on a database in plain

975
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,880
text this is kind of funny and again not

976
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,920
new but because business users are

977
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,540
building these applications how do they

978
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,280
know how to store credit cards it's not

979
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,619
really their role so let me show you let

980
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,260
me show you a specific example this is

981
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,359
an HR team at the large IT company

982
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:02,880
basically they created the they wanted

983
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,680
to do a giveaway campaign when people

984
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,079
can donate donate money to charity so

985
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,000
they created a small application that

986
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,400
did a very simple thing you register to

987
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,900
the application you provide your credit

988
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,579
card and you say which and you choose

989
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,440
the charity you'd like to donate to and

990
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,619
the company will will donate as well now

991
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,420
the credit cards that were collected

992
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,780
there was stored a in plain text B in an

993
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,400
environment which was kind of a

994
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,960
development environment showed across

995
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,760
the entire organization

996
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,339
okay so again this is very cool that

997
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,560
business users are able to do this but

998
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,599
this is kind of a problem and by the way

999
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,700
they found this when a compliance audit

1000
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,980
all started asking questions which which

1001
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,920
is kind of a difficult place to be at

1002
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,900
um and we are seeing this thing about

1003
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,300
kind of uh sensitive data that's being

1004
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,920
handled by these these these

1005
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,160
applications a lot and again because uh

1006
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,260
these platforms are built these local

1007
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,700
platforms are built on top of SAS

1008
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,380
platforms that contain business data

1009
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,300
it's very difficult difficult to create

1010
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,460
those uh those distinctions to make sure

1011
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,720
that things

1012
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,280
um that these applications are not

1013
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,740
touching business data for example

1014
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,920
one other thing that is clear is that

1015
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,540
most of these applications are built

1016
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,440
outside of it's IO control there are so

1017
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,420
many cases where somebody builds a

1018
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,400
successful application other people are

1019
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,380
using them and then this person leaves

1020
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,780
the organization okay what happens now

1021
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,380
this application is remains I mean it's

1022
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,480
used until it doesn't work anymore and

1023
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,760
then who would you call what would

1024
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,380
happen if this application gets hacked

1025
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,300
who would be who would own it I mean

1026
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,660
this is a really difficult situation and

1027
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,940
this is because we as the people that

1028
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,619
are in charge of kind of secure in the

1029
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,359
organization were really not not aware

1030
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,240
of them one of the key things that that

1031
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,760
I see people try to do here is is focus

1032
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,619
on applications that become viral within

1033
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,359
the organization so focus on those apps

1034
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,579
that are not used by one user or a

1035
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:58,800
couple of users by use by a lot of

1036
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,560
different users within the org

1037
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,960
and the last problem that I'll mention

1038
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,339
here is login and monitoring so this is

1039
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,079
it's funny but there are kind of two

1040
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,940
separate problems here which are kind of

1041
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,220
the opposite one is that in many cases

1042
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,740
there are no logs at all so you won't

1043
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,440
find or the logs are not available to

1044
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,599
the right people so again just think

1045
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,640
about whether you can if something

1046
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,960
happens with one of these applications

1047
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,400
whether you can actually create an

1048
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,839
investigation to find out what happened

1049
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,760
who is logging into these applications

1050
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,160
what data did they did they provide to

1051
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,720
that to those users so those things

1052
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,720
don't really exist but on the other hand

1053
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,599
some of these actual components so for

1054
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,579
example it's automations

1055
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,180
have a habit of recording everything and

1056
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,160
when I say everything I mean all of the

1057
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,079
data that goes through those automations

1058
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:51,839
and so one of the one of the issues that

1059
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,940
we're seeing is that let's say I build

1060
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,940
an application that allows you to check

1061
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,760
your email or something okay now you can

1062
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,579
use you you can use the application but

1063
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,220
as the build of that application I can

1064
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,859
access the logs that are that are

1065
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:09,660
available to that application which can

1066
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,119
include the actual data that goes

1067
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,400
through the app okay which is again a

1068
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,820
very clear pass to privilege to prove

1069
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,980
the Discrimination of one user to be

1070
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,960
able to view things by other users and

1071
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,460
actually uh

1072
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,740
previously

1073
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,060
earlier this year Defcon I showed how

1074
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,160
this specific capability could be used

1075
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,540
to move laterally across the

1076
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,020
organization

1077
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,380
all right so we have seen uh let's talk

1078
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,420
about what we've seen so far

1079
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,060
we've seen that Loco knocker is rapidly

1080
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,160
going within the organization and

1081
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,380
chances are it's already there in your

1082
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,920
org and I'm not saying this is a you

1083
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,660
shouldn't be worried about this you

1084
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,760
should bring it under the security

1085
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,740
umbrella I mean security business users

1086
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,859
are in many cases you'll find that there

1087
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,480
are teams that have already started

1088
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,400
developing critical applications on

1089
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,079
these platforms and they are scared

1090
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,000
because nobody's helping them got to

1091
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,020
make sure they're doing the right thing

1092
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,200
there's a huge opportunity here for us

1093
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,440
to to be part of that conversation we we

1094
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,900
saw that there's missing sdlc in some

1095
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,640
cases there is some sdlc but in many

1096
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,520
cases you'll find none and I really

1097
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,980
encourage you to look at the OS top 10

1098
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,320
there are a bunch of more examples that

1099
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,940
I haven't shared here already and

1100
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,460
actually uh where the the new version

1101
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,839
that we're going to share is going to be

1102
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,520
much deeper one of the things that we

1103
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,359
are working on is having those top 10

1104
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,740
written in a way that you can actually

1105
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,119
give your business users and they will

1106
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,660
understand stand to help them kind of be

1107
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,119
closer to the security mindset the

1108
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,160
opportunities for you to take and this

1109
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,020
this might be the important the most

1110
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,339
important thing to take out of the

1111
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,800
slides out of this talk there's a huge

1112
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,119
opportunity for you to be the champion

1113
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,460
of of this space within your

1114
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,040
organization absec needs to be part of

1115
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,020
the local local conversation or the

1116
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,300
business development conversation we are

1117
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,680
seeing organizations that are creating

1118
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,780
security Frameworks or basically

1119
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:09,000
extending the secure development

1120
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,980
policies that they have to business

1121
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,020
users and of course there's a lot of

1122
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,339
there's a lot of need to think about

1123
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:17,579
what exactly do you want to build what

1124
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,920
use cases are approved how do you how

1125
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,660
are you checking those those use cases

1126
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,940
how how are you providing galleries for

1127
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,760
those users to build correctly but kind

1128
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,480
of

1129
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,060
instead of just thinking so they don't

1130
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,560
need to think about security you can

1131
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,780
just continue building but you protect

1132
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,400
them along the way

1133
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,320
if you're interested please reach out

1134
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,140
and um I think this is we have some time

1135
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,240
for questions so thank you very much

1136
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,559
[Applause]

1137
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,200
I might do this so we have light

1138
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:57,180
thank you I'll be coming around and

1139
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,540
let's see okay now I can see

1140
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:04,020
you raised your hand okay come on

1141
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,460
wait wait I'm gonna give you the

1142
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,880
microphone

1143
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,240
so something that came to mind for me

1144
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,319
was

1145
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:16,260
um when we've you know seen people whose

1146
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,140
say Office 365 email has been

1147
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,480
compromised and you know the bad guys

1148
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,880
tend to create Outlook rules and things

1149
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,740
like that to forward emails for business

1150
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,240
email compromise and things like that I

1151
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,200
was wondering if you've seen any

1152
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,839
instances where these automations were

1153
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,520
used to you know do that as well like

1154
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,980
the email things and that you suggested

1155
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,520
so unfortunately yes about uh three

1156
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,980
years ago Microsoft published a report

1157
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,900
where a single organization was attacked

1158
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,520
by something like four different manual

1159
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,460
groups and Defenders were looking to

1160
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,619
clear the network out of Marvel for like

1161
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,500
six six months and they they they

1162
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,900
weren't able to find what was what was

1163
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,119
going on after six months they found a

1164
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,940
single power automatic automation they

1165
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,440
did a very simple thing it was running

1166
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,500
under administrative permissions and on

1167
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,900
a schedule it used the e-discovery tools

1168
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,420
by Microsoft to find sensitive

1169
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,400
information Secret that's whatever it

1170
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,920
could across the organization store all

1171
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,839
of them and send them to an HTTP

1172
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,640
endpoint and this was a single

1173
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,859
automation that I mean just trying to

1174
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:21,900
find this this automation took so much

1175
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,599
time and so this is and this is a I can

1176
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:25,800
share a link afterwards if you're

1177
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,220
interested uh shoot me an email or or on

1178
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,819
Twitter but this was actually uh this

1179
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:34,619
was actually a long time ago ever since

1180
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:36,660
then we've we've seen this happen mostly

1181
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,040
As mistakes people that are making

1182
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,260
mistakes and just moving that outside of

1183
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,680
the org

1184
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,760
on to the next question

1185
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,319
any ideas on a strategy for how to

1186
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,900
detect and find these things in your

1187
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,680
organization yes so I I do have one

1188
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,599
optimistic message here

1189
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,319
we we have to remember that these things

1190
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:10,079
I mean data that that was these local

1191
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,540
applications are replacing uh what you

1192
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,099
can call copy and paste integration

1193
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,619
people have been moving files from one

1194
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,780
place to another since forever and we've

1195
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,280
been trying to address it with DLP

1196
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,900
Solutions and other things for a long

1197
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,460
time and and we haven't been successful

1198
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,680
though but now when business users are

1199
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,960
using these local local platforms you

1200
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,599
there's somebody you can ask tell me you

1201
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,160
can go to the platform you can go to the

1202
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,560
platform API and ask what are all of the

1203
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,599
applications that are available in your

1204
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:37,980
platform that have been built on top of

1205
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,960
your platform now of course it does

1206
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,900
require you to understand what these

1207
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,540
applications are doing to scan for

1208
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,460
example what the definitions of those

1209
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,960
applications to actually figure out what

1210
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,640
data they're touching and we are seeing

1211
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,859
organizations that are that are actually

1212
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:55,140
going through those processes so you can

1213
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,720
do it you can automatically scan those

1214
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,940
applications find inventory then find

1215
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,040
vulnerabilities collect logs but you

1216
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,079
need there's a lot of work that you in

1217
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,260
order to in order to do that you do have

1218
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,480
an API for some of it so you do have for

1219
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,000
example an API to to query whatever all

1220
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,619
of the applications that existed there

1221
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:15,839
is much more than we had uh when new

1222
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,700
businesses were just copying files

1223
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:22,260
thank thank you we have four minutes

1224
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,900
more left for questions anybody else

1225
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,920
it seemed like one of the largest issues

1226
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,079
you mentioned with this was role-based

1227
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,700
authentication

1228
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,020
um

1229
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,520
it seems like largely that's because

1230
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,579
it's operating outside of the existing

1231
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:44,760
structures we have for auditing that you

1232
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,619
mentioned sock I believe

1233
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:48,900
do you think that we would still see

1234
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,359
benefit in the low code no code

1235
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,060
Solutions if we forced them to go

1236
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,859
through the more standard process of

1237
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:58,200
role-based Authentication

1238
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,420
and how do you see that working when

1239
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,940
currently there seem to be working

1240
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,380
around

1241
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:07,260
current authorization structures do you

1242
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,640
think and I know you said that we can't

1243
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,319
rely on them to or rely on the tools

1244
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:15,720
to fix the problems for us do you think

1245
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,920
it's reasonable that they should be

1246
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,500
working within current structures such

1247
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,540
as oauth so I think all of the platforms

1248
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,400
have a way for you to build your

1249
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,040
applications uh and and connect to

1250
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,900
things with service accounts rather than

1251
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,359
users which which would be the best case

1252
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,220
scenario right because then you can

1253
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,740
provision those accounts you can you can

1254
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,140
monitor them Etc the problem is that

1255
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,420
this means that somebody needs to ask

1256
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,700
for permissions which creates a

1257
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,319
roadblock which means that the

1258
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,560
applications won't get fully adopted

1259
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,079
adopted which means in my at least in my

1260
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,020
view that it would never really happen I

1261
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,640
mean again these capabilities are

1262
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,700
available some in some platforms people

1263
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,680
are actually using service accounts but

1264
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,619
enforcing the use of service accounts I

1265
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,660
I don't see a way for this to work

1266
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,300
together with the exponential growth

1267
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,220
with the quadratic growth that we've

1268
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,380
that we've seen earlier

1269
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,079
there are cases and we're connecting

1270
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,940
this to the previous problem to the

1271
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,500
previous question one of the things is I

1272
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,140
that I do see Enterprises do is that

1273
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,660
they make sure that for some use cases

1274
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,099
so for example if you're touching

1275
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:27,780
business sensitive data if you're

1276
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,760
touching credit cards you have to use a

1277
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,319
service account but then you need to

1278
00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:33,119
create you need some way to to actually

1279
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,460
enforce that that rule

1280
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,640
thank you and this will be our last

1281
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,259
question we have one minute left

1282
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,839
um yeah somebody who is kind of dealing

1283
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,420
with a new low code new code environment

1284
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,220
coming in

1285
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,440
um I Echo everything you said um one of

1286
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,900
the things in the security organization

1287
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,579
we sort of caught it

1288
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:02,220
sort of late into the adoption cycle

1289
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,220
and um one of the things that we've had

1290
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:09,420
to do is basically say that only modules

1291
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,980
that have been vetted

1292
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,079
are allowed to be brought into our

1293
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,880
organization so something equivalent to

1294
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,900
artifactory kind of a model and we've

1295
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,180
also had to work with the vendor

1296
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,460
applying heavy pressure

1297
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,359
to allow our son sonar Cube rules so

1298
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,040
example be applied

1299
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,020
and just as a normal sort of thing with

1300
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,420
hard guard rail mechanisms it was

1301
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,880
something that no code low code vendor

1302
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,359
was like very very very grumpy about but

1303
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:44,339
it's something that we've really twisted

1304
00:49:44,339 --> 00:49:46,619
the screws on and so we are

1305
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:48,060
you know I'm not going to say what my

1306
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,280
organization is obviously but it's

1307
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,599
something that everything you said is

1308
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,940
absolutely 100 and we've been applying

1309
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,500
screws on that stuff

1310
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:59,579
thank you I think that uh one of the

1311
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,160
one of the mistakes we I think we should

1312
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,920
avoid I mean we should we must push the

1313
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,460
vendors to be better however

1314
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,040
um we need to understand that there's an

1315
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,599
entire ecosystem that needs to be built

1316
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:14,880
here right when there are proficient

1317
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,520
when you build a a normal app a pro code

1318
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,460
app you have a shift left you have

1319
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,800
runtime monitoring you have uh Network

1320
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,180
parameter you have a bunch of things

1321
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,099
that are helping you prevent mistakes

1322
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:28,560
and prevent attacks in no code you don't

1323
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,780
really have all of them and vendors

1324
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,160
would solve everything for us but

1325
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,980
vendors need to make it easier for us to

1326
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,780
actually solve those problems I know

1327
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,520
