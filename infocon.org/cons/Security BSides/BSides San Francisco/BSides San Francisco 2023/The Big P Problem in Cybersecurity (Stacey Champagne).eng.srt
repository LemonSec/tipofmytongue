and CEO of hacker and heels it's my goal

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,320
to revolutionize the cyber security

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,900
industry by helping more women launch

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,359
grow and land positions of power and

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,640
influence across the field

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,920
today I speak from my own experience as

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,840
a senior manager of global Insider

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,359
threat investigations and one of the big

12

um you know having done and I'm still

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,540
currently working in cyber security for

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,980
almost eight years now but of course

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,620
what I share today does not represent my

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,480
employers if you go on LinkedIn and go

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,520
figure out immediately what who I you

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,500
know who I work for I'm not representing

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,360
them today I'm only here to represent

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,660
myself in hacker and heels and also um

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,700
you know hear thanks to the Fantastic

23
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,980
organization secure diversity Who

24
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,020
provided me with this opportunity so big

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,340
thanks to them and all that they're

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,500
doing for promoting gender equity in

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,000
cyber security

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,140
so

29
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,860
I think I have a pretty good idea as to

30
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,560
why you all are joining me today because

31
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,860
you know and I know that we have a big

32
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,600
problem

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,159
it is a 10.5 trillion dollar problem

34
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,100
which is the total estimated cost of

35
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,799
cyber crime by the year 2025

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,580
it's also a 3.4 million people problem

37
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,640
which is the amount of people needed to

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,140
fill open cyber security roles worldwide

39
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,000
but you know this this isn't another

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
talk about the cyber security Talent

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,140
shortage uh you know sometimes honestly

42
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,119
it sounds like you know the points don't

43
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,920
matter everything's made up

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,060
um you know that's a debate for another

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,680
time as to how many roles are actually

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,540
out there and whatnot but

47
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,159
um you know today we're actually we're

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,200
going to talk about this guy or

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,460
maybe it's

50
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,700
this guy we're gonna talk about

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,280
wait actually it's definitely this guy

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,159
we're gonna talk about this guy

53
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,619
no wait I'm getting a little ahead of

54
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,459
myself so let me just go back a bit

55
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,860
we have a big problem

56
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,260
we have a problem that is affecting

57
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,980
almost half of everybody at this event

58
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,140
when you do the math

59
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,239
it's actually a problem that's affecting

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,300
over 2.1 million cyber Security

61
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,480
Professionals worldwide

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,620
it's affecting people like this person

63
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,879
and this person

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,700
and this person

65
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,980
can I let you in on a little secret

66
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,140
actually let's do this

67
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,000
in a minute

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
everyone's gonna close their eyes if

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,540
they feel comfortable to do so and on

70
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,580
the count of three I want you to raise

71
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,200
your hand

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,560
I want you to raise your hand if you've

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,540
ever thought to yourself

74
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,300
what the heck am I doing here and I

75
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,340
don't mean like here right now at

76
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,500
besides San Francisco I just mean like

77
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,480
in cyber security

78
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,080
in your job you know where you can do

79
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,959
all your work perfectly and you'll still

80
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,780
end up breached or paying a ransom

81
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,680
where even if you're not on call

82
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,860
um you know you're basically always are

83
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,800
and where you're continually expected to

84
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,360
do more and be perfect with sub-optimal

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,220
staff and tools

86
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,540
all right so everybody close your eyes

87
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,480
ready close your eyes keep them closed I

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,440
want you to raise your hand in three

89
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,159
two one

90
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,819
all right

91
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,379
now if you're raising your hand I want

92
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,540
you to keep it up so keep your hands up

93
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,480
and then I want everybody to open their

94
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
eyes and look around the room

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
so those of you who are raising your

96
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,400
hands thank you for your honesty

97
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,739
I hope you recognize that you're not

98
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:08,700
alone

99
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,159
these feelings and these doubts you

100
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,459
might have are not unique to you

101
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,339
and for those who didn't raise their

102
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,358
hand

103
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,220
you know if it's not you that's

104
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,160
potentially eyeing the exit odds are you

105
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,800
probably know someone who has quit cyber

106
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,600
security altogether due to the burnout

107
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,940
and I'm gonna say it is all because of

108
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,520
this guy

109
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,220
no

110
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,120
these guys

111
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,000
Peters

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
Peters

113
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,620
okay so some of you all maybe have

114
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,720
picked up with where I'm going with this

115
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,120
and look it's not all Peter's faults

116
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,880
there's certainly more Nuance that we're

117
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,160
gonna get to but you gotta admit when

118
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
you start to string things together

119
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,560
there's a compelling case that Peters do

120
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,160
play a role

121
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,300
the big problem the big p problem in

122
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,860
cyber security

123
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,040
is a little something called the Peter

124
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,000
Principle

125
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,840
all right so in 1968 we have a guy his

126
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,360
name is Lawrence J Peter he published

127
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,740
this book called the Peter Principle

128
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,400
which set out to answer the question why

129
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,460
is incompetence so maddeningly rampant

130
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,300
and so vexingly triumphant

131
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,699
and the the book goes on to try to

132
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,979
explain how incompetent and it's

133
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,979
accompanying symptoms syndromes and

134
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,620
remedies to find the world and the work

135
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,340
that we do within it in this principle

136
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,860
which Dr Peter alleges is based off of

137
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,039
quote hundreds of cases of Occupational

138
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,479
incompetence

139
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,639
found that

140
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,060
in a hierarchy every employee tends to

141
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,759
rise to his level of incompetence given

142
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,160
enough time and enough levels in the

143
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
hierarchy

144
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,780
basically you know an employee does well

145
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,180
and they get promoted they do the next

146
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,160
level job well they get promoted again

147
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,759
and then the next job same thing they

148
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,039
keep going up and up until they're no

149
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,520
longer at a level performing where

150
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,560
they're deserving of a promotion and

151
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,440
let's be honest they end up reaching a

152
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,840
point where they just they suck at the

153
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,639
job they're in

154
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,819
and now I'm positive there's at least

155
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,699
one of you in here that is thinking to

156
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,539
yourself

157
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,060
I know that person I know that person

158
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,740
that you might even work for that person

159
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,380
and you are feeling A Rush of relief

160
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,960
because there is finally something to

161
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,360
explain why your manager is driving you

162
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,460
crazy

163
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,759
but I gotta say when the Peter Principle

164
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,620
was first introduced

165
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,560
it was never actually empirically tested

166
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,360
with data

167
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,639
so it's kind of made up

168
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,940
at least you know much much much later

169
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,120
like 50 years later we finally in 2018

170
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,000
we had Harvard Business Review Forbes

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,759
are both posting about a a study of you

172
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,259
know over 50

173
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,360
000 sales people and their managers

174
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,660
across like you know over 200 firms and

175
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,639
and they did this study and they they

176
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,860
focused on sales because

177
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,360
um you know it's an ideal setting for

178
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,039
testing the Peter Principle because it's

179
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,500
so easy to identify you know who are the

180
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,660
high performing sales people and who are

181
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,340
the managers and for the sales people

182
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,039
you've got their sales records for the

183
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,660
managers you can measure their

184
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,360
managerial ability by how much they help

185
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,340
you know improve the performance of

186
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,560
their direct reports so how much you

187
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,360
know are there people selling

188
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,539
and so this study sought to answer the

189
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,360
question do organizations really just

190
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,380
pass over the best potential managers by

191
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,639
promoting the best individual

192
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,259
contributors

193
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,080
now between you and me do we really need

194
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,539
a study to kind of tell us what we all

195
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,120
kind of already know do we like let's

196
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,259
just be honest

197
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,960
um I mean really what do you think uh

198
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,099
raise your hand if you think

199
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,900
organizations pass over the best

200
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,000
potential managers by promoting the best

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,700
individual contributors who thinks that

202
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,958
exactly

203
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,419
so I'm happy to give all of you who did

204
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,700
raise their hands the validation that at

205
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,880
least according to the study they do

206
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,760
the study found that first off sales

207
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,740
performance is highly correlated with

208
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,200
promotion and management so you know

209
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
each higher sales rank as you go up and

210
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,240
up you're you know doing more and more

211
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,640
your rise and more and more as an IC you

212
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,220
you get about 15 higher probability that

213
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,080
you're going to then be promoted into a

214
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,360
Sales Management role

215
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,060
now the problem with this is when these

216
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,680
high performing individual contributors

217
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,720
were promoted into these positions of

218
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,120
management the performance of the teams

219
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,180
that they reported to declined seven and

220
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,700
a half percent so you know to kind of

221
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,320
play this out in some terminology that

222
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,700
we're all familiar with let's say you

223
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,980
were like an IC level 2 and then you

224
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,620
were promoted to a manager role and you

225
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,120
know the team that you were once part of

226
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,459
perhaps that that team now reports to

227
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:31,380
you and they're going to take a

228
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,580
performance hit

229
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,160
and that that performance hit is even

230
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,440
more if you were you know let's say in

231
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,260
ic level four if you were an even higher

232
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,140
uh performing individual contributor and

233
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,060
you were promoted to manager

234
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,820
bigger declining your team's performance

235
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,980
and this study said that it didn't

236
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,720
matter if these people were promoted

237
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,459
like within their own team so like you

238
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,200
know someone you know

239
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,600
um you know if the previous manager left

240
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,459
and um you know one of the high

241
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,740
performing ICS took over

242
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,720
um or if they were asked to manage an

243
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,940
entirely different team uh that they

244
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,860
never worked at you know part of as an

245
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,100
IC before and so these researchers

246
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,860
concluded that you know consistent with

247
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,019
the Peter Principle we find that

248
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,019
promotion decisions Place more weight on

249
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,880
current performance than would be

250
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,519
justified if firms only tried to promote

251
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,700
the best potential managers the most

252
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,339
productive worker is not always the best

253
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,560
candidate to be a manager

254
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,500
yet firms are significantly more likely

255
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,839
to promote top Frontline sales workers

256
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,839
into managerial positions as a result

257
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,880
the performance of the new managers

258
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,339
supporting it declines relatively more

259
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,920
after the managerial position is filled

260
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,019
by someone who is a strong salesperson

261
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,800
prior to promotion

262
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,500
the professors go on to state that these

263
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,959
findings underscore the possibility that

264
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,540
promoting based off of lower level job

265
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,660
skills rather than managerial skills can

266
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,079
be extremely costly and this makes sense

267
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,180
because now you have a person who has

268
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,339
built fantastic relationships with

269
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,560
clients they're no longer the face of

270
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,180
those accounts and instead they're

271
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,279
directing others on a team you know

272
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,019
they're trying to tell them how they did

273
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,300
what they did and they're having a hard

274
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,640
time using management and Leadership

275
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,220
skills that they never previously had to

276
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,600
demonstrate in their individual

277
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,820
contributor roles

278
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,880
so indeed's career guide has a list of

279
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,940
these key skills for an individual

280
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,860
contributor versus a manager and you'll

281
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,540
see that the individual contributor

282
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,940
roles list things like decision making

283
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,519
technical knowledge active listening

284
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,940
team orientation whereas the manager

285
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,820
role lists project management strategic

286
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,420
thinking conflict resolution motivation

287
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,420
these are different skills we know

288
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,700
that an employee's relationship with

289
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,120
their manager has a huge influence on

290
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,540
workplace experiences

291
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,519
take for example women in cyber

292
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,920
Security's 2023 state of inclusion of

293
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,300
women and cyber security report which

294
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,860
found that leadership and direct

295
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,500
managers are the top two sources of

296
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,720
experience of exclusion that is people

297
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,019
not policies are the most common sources

298
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,600
of experience of exclusion in the

299
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,800
workplace

300
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,860
and then what's a conversation without

301
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,600
you know about the state of the

302
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,880
workplace without bringing up quiet

303
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,200
quitting

304
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,899
so another study found uh you know

305
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,959
included almost 3 000 managers rated by

306
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,959
over 13 000 direct reports and found

307
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,360
that the least effective managers have

308
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,000
three to four times as many people who

309
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,920
fall in that quote quiet quitting

310
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,019
category compared with the most

311
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,260
effective leaders so 14 of their direct

312
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,959
reports were considered quietly quitting

313
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:00,720
and only 20 percent were willing to give

314
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,160
extra effort

315
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,200
but now you take the converse of that

316
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,940
and you've got you know you take the

317
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,639
managers who were the best at balancing

318
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,779
results with relationships they saw that

319
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:16,019
62 of their direct reports were willing

320
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,899
to go and give that extra effort where

321
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,720
that and only three percent of them were

322
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,940
considered quiet quitting

323
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,040
so zanger and folkman who were the offer

324
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,839
authors of this article in which this

325
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,779
study is cited in found that quote many

326
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,060
people at some point in their career

327
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,519
have worked for a manager that moved

328
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,220
them towards quiet quitting there this

329
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,980
comes from feeling undervalued and

330
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,740
unappreciated it's possible that the

331
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,260
managers were biased or that they

332
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,639
engaged in behavior that was

333
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,839
inappropriate

334
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,660
employees lack of motivation was there

335
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,820
for a reaction to the actions of their

336
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,519
manager and most mid-level career

337
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,800
employees have also worked for a leader

338
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,959
for whom they've had actually a strong

339
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,240
desire to do everything possible to

340
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,880
accomplish goals and objectives

341
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,380
occasionally working late or starting

342
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,139
early was not resented

343
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:13,139
for this key point the manager inspired

344
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,399
them

345
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,720
now

346
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,820
I'd ask how many people in here feel

347
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,920
that their manager is an inspiration to

348
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,320
them but that might put anyone who's

349
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,300
here and attending the conference with

350
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,980
potentially their manager of their cyber

351
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,079
security team in a slightly awkward spot

352
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,839
so I'm not gonna do that and honestly

353
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:33,540
like this isn't a meant to be a talk of

354
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,399
like 20 minutes of roasting cyber

355
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,860
security managers in fact I have a lot

356
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,620
of empathy for Peters of the world you

357
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,240
know they're trying to get ahead make a

358
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,639
living just like all of us put roofs

359
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,740
over their head food on the table it's

360
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,260
an increasingly expensive World

361
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,760
um so I'm not going to you know blame

362
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,199
Peters out there for taking the

363
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,540
opportunity and instead I really want to

364
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,880
focus on the systems and beliefs that

365
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,920
enabled Peter to get there in the first

366
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,240
place

367
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,279
so you know I don't have any concrete

368
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,620
stats but I just know from my experience

369
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,899
you know when I landed in my first

370
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,079
management role I I didn't have any

371
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,500
Management training now I'm super you

372
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,579
know

373
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,440
um Vigilant and going out there and

374
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,720
getting books and training and paying my

375
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,760
own money and time and whatnot to build

376
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,040
up my leadership skills but not

377
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,440
everybody has that intrinsic motivation

378
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,320
or mindset or self-awareness to continue

379
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,620
that Learning and Development not

380
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,940
everybody can see their own

381
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,459
opportunities for growth adequately

382
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,680
solicit and apply feedback for their own

383
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,320
performance and honestly like most

384
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,019
people are afraid of speaking to one

385
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,199
another with radical Candor so yo if you

386
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,120
haven't heard the saying uh Kim Scott

387
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,519
Apple and Google executive which she

388
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,860
sums it up basically as like saying what

389
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,600
you think while also giving a damn about

390
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,699
the person you're saying it to

391
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:57,839
and

392
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,300
research from Gallup finds that only

393
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,300
about one in ten people possess the

394
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,579
talent to manage and yet we act like

395
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,100
this is something that everyone can and

396
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,440
should do and so we end up with managers

397
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,540
who are bad who don't know they're bad

398
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,399
and then we have people who won't tell

399
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,959
them that they're bad and then even

400
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,660
worse the manager you know has been at

401
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,579
the company for a while and if there's

402
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,740
an opening at the next level they might

403
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,480
even just get promoted because no one

404
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,639
knows what to do with them right so

405
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,779
companies don't know how to hold

406
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,639
managers accountable for their

407
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,740
performance as a manager and

408
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,139
understandably so right when so many

409
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,540
companies just don't even know how to

410
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,339
manage and measure performance in

411
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,740
general and quite frankly even if they

412
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,680
did figure it out I I don't know if they

413
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,199
would actually care because let's be

414
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,079
honest if if they actually cared if the

415
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,639
people in power actually cared we would

416
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,920
want to have more women in positions of

417
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,440
leadership and power because companies

418
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
with women leaders outperform companies

419
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,459
don't nominated by men

420
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,399
and two we'd have the ability to choose

421
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,380
where we would like to work as opposed

422
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,119
to being forced back into offices five

423
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,980
days a week or you know any number of

424
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,140
days higher than zero because you know

425
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,699
there's more than enough studies that

426
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,099
show the benefits of remote work for

427
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,020
day-to-day operations in a variety of

428
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,419
roles including many in cyber security

429
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:22,500
so you know we know that managers play a

430
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,839
critical role in the workplace we have

431
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,760
plenty of studies and stats but just

432
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,260
like the companies don't want to invest

433
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,880
in entry-level Junior cyber security

434
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,740
Talent neither do they want to invest in

435
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,020
the talent that they already have

436
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,419
so instead we're just going to keep

437
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,820
repeating the mistakes of the past stack

438
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,919
ranking trying to force a healthy

439
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,840
Culture by cutting the bottom 10

440
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,940
performers

441
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,559
um you know it just it's just going to

442
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,600
keep going on and you know you think

443
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,640
that meritocracy might be able to save

444
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,200
some of this but if you believe in

445
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,059
meritocracy you know I have a bridge to

446
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,860
sell you but you know instead of hanging

447
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,320
on the bridge please just go read a book

448
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,000
so this approach to Performance

449
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,520
Management just perpetuates the need to

450
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,380
climb up the ladder to avoid the

451
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,140
alligators into higher roles and

452
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,700
inevitably management that just doesn't

453
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,799
make sense for 9 out of 10 people

454
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,100
now you know this this zero-sum Winner

455
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,320
Takes all masculine capitalistic

456
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,059
Approach at the end of the day just

457
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,280
doesn't serve the vast majority of

458
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,620
society and so we need a new approach

459
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,260
for me I would argue that it's a

460
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,539
feminist approach

461
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,179
which I like Canada's description

462
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,880
which you can read here values diversity

463
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,039
inclusion for achieving transformative

464
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,440
change sustainable development

465
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,240
um response to lived experiences and so

466
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,980
forth and so when we're when we're not

467
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,140
focused on forcing everyone into a

468
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,820
single track of success but instead

469
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,039
finding ways for people to be successful

470
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,740
where they are and where they want to be

471
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,780
based off of their own unique skills

472
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,480
values and circumstances our companies

473
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,780
and societies will be better for it

474
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,059
now I don't have time to really get into

475
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,780
it today but I can tell you that there

476
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,780
are four distinct profiles of people's

477
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,539
relationships to their careers and their

478
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,640
firestarters collaborators drivers and

479
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,220
side Hustlers these are passion profiles

480
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,960
they were created by

481
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,580
um Rachel East and Kristen Walker

482
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,260
they're from Clarity on fire they're

483
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,320
coaches with Decades of experience and

484
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,820
they really focus on people's

485
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,760
relationship in accordance with time

486
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
money and passion I really recommend

487
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,559
checking them out and learning more

488
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,000
about these

489
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,940
um but basically you know at the end of

490
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,900
the day

491
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,240
we can't keep managing people like

492
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,799
they're all the same that they all want

493
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,720
the same things that they do what they

494
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,580
want to do for for you know the same

495
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,780
reasons

496
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,320
capitalism expects everyone to Aspire to

497
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,539
a corner office but we're just seeing in

498
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:58,080
real time that that's not sustainable so

499
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,440
you know it brings me back to Peter

500
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,140
Peter's not having a good time but like

501
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,299
at the end of the day Peter has a team

502
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,640
and so

503
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,160
how could we help out

504
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,980
Poland Peter's team Peter has a

505
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,380
collecting of people who have ideas and

506
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,020
experiences and how to accomplish the

507
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,640
very things that they're being asked to

508
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,460
deliver people who with the rare

509
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,539
exception generally want to do good work

510
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:29,400
they are ready they're waiting and

511
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,200
they're willing to be called in and

512
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,299
they're actually dying to be called in

513
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,539
because they don't want Peter to say yes

514
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,419
to another senseless project or drive

515
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,460
the team in the wrong direction for

516
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,799
miles and miles because they won't stop

517
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,380
and ask for direction the people on

518
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,660
Peter's team they're the equivalent of

519
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,160
like I don't know the exasperated

520
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,320
passenger in the movies during a family

521
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,620
road trip and so just getting to the

522
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,960
point of it here to fix the Peter

523
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,120
Principle and cyber security three

524
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,120
things recognize that not everybody

525
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,059
wants to or should be a manager

526
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:09,480
provide managers at all levels with

527
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,000
greater support and accountability and

528
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,640
compassionately realign managers who

529
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,780
don't meet expectations

530
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,280
I'd love to talk more about this with

531
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,020
you on the side so feel free to hit me

532
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,290
up and thank you so much for listening

533
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:30,480
[Applause]

534
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,600
amazing thank you Stacy do we have any

535
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,899
questions

536
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,860
in the back

537
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,360
so this is sort of the flip side of not

538
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,220
every good I see should be a manager

539
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,780
because I agree

540
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,580
um

541
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,000
what are things that you think should be

542
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,419
considered both on should someone like

543
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,640
when reflecting on their own path like

544
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,760
should I go into management and also how

545
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,860
should they identify other people and be

546
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,419
like hey maybe you should go into

547
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,940
management because you'd be good at it

548
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,100
yeah that's a great question you know it

549
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,659
it really all starts with because

550
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:17,760
because management inevitably involves

551
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,740
leadership of people usually at most

552
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,419
places right you gotta have people

553
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:23,820
reporting to you or whatnot if you're if

554
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,760
you are someone who

555
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,360
um

556
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,020
you know are have have room to grow in

557
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,179
regards to developing empathy and trying

558
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,740
to put yourself in other people's shoes

559
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,500
and stuff like that like maybe people

560
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,240
management maybe management isn't the

561
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,400
right position for you right

562
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,960
um you know if you're someone who

563
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,780
arguably like has a lot going on in

564
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,419
their life and you know work is part of

565
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:49,860
your life and work is paying the bills

566
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,360
but it's not your whole life and it's

567
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,919
you know and you have other things and

568
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,059
other commitments and things that you're

569
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,520
worried about you also when you step

570
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,320
into a manager role you have the lives

571
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,940
of several other people in your hands

572
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,860
like let's just be honest about it like

573
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,960
a big the whole reason why we all do

574
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,400
what we do is to get a paycheck to be

575
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,539
able to put a roof over our heads and

576
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,400
stuff like that and so just as much as

577
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,440
you need to be on with your career and

578
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,059
making sure that you know you're taking

579
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,740
care of yourself you're also going to

580
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,480
have a certain responsibility to these

581
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,520
people who report to you and if that's

582
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,140
not something that you know sounds

583
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,240
exciting or fulfilling for you then

584
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,100
don't do it right but like the problem

585
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,140
is we've set up uh you know our

586
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,460
organizations and whatnot and

587
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,620
expectations society and the way that we

588
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,240
look at other people and how we talk

589
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,940
about other people is that like if you

590
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,860
can't manage people then you're a

591
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,539
failure right like if you step into that

592
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,700
role and you realize it's not for you

593
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,440
like you're a failure or you're doing

594
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,059
something wrong or you're not performing

595
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,620
as you should be when the reality is

596
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,880
it's like it has nothing to do with your

597
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,260
performance it has everything to do with

598
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,200
the misalignment of your values and you

599
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,059
know what's important to you and and

600
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:52,740
where your strengths are and stuff like

601
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,380
that so you know if someone who shows

602
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,020
deep care for other people like that's a

603
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,480
pretty good indicator of potentially

604
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,940
um you know being being a good candidate

605
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,320
for management

606
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,580
um you know especially if someone is

607
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,000
good at organizing and leading and being

608
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,700
strategic and being able to um you know

609
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,320
capitalize on people's strengths and

610
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,840
whatnot like all great skills

611
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,159
um you know the problem comes into play

612
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,080
when you just if you're someone who just

613
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,400
would rather like

614
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,960
you don't know how to explain things

615
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,460
you'd rather just jump in yourself and

616
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,080
do it yourself and solve it yourself and

617
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,360
not talk to anybody or anything like

618
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,400
might not management I might not be

619
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,679
right for you but again like that's okay

620
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,900
and we need to do more as a workplace

621
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,659
culture to make it okay to not be a

622
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,240
manager and still reach different levels

623
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,760
of success and Define and have more than

624
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,720
one definition of what success is

625
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,200
oh

626
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,640
all right awesome thank you very much

627
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,080
another round of Applied please thank

628
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,760
you you

629
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,789
[Applause]
