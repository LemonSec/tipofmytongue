1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,820
welcome to the state of blockchain

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,200
security

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,560
in case we have not met my name is Peter

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,000
and I stumbled upon this field of

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,160
blockchain security accidentally about

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,099
five years ago and I'm very excited to

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,900
share with you like what it is what are

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,300
the threats what is this why is this so

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,699
near and dear to me

10
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,020
um

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,420
in case you're not familiar it's a brand

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,699
new security field with a mission of

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,140
securing and defending the

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,019
cryptocurrency ecosystem and you know we

15
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,640
can think of cryptocurrency ecosystem

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,320
where you read about the news you know

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,040
people buying dogs and jpegs and all

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,040
sorts of fun stuff but to me it's about

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,140
the Ukrainian and Russian refugees

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,899
escaping War zones and you know being

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,539
able to preserve their livelihoods even

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,640
when they're going through you know

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,960
border control that takes everything

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,379
away by just memorizing 12 words that's

25
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,480
that's all it takes that's not something

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,760
that my family was able to do that's why

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,480
to me if I spend my time making the

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,060
system safe and sound and it saves at

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,159
least one family out there to preserve

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,140
their livelihoods it's worthwhile and I

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,600
invite you to join me

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,640
I have a whole lot of content for you so

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,340
talk fast there'll be hopefully some

34
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,920
time to ask questions but I really want

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,479
to give you a map for this brand new

36
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:23,759
industry explain what are the unique

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,380
threats what are the unique

38
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,840
opportunities for you to build on and

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,360
let's see maybe you'll find it fun

40
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,280
enough to explore more

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,140
so that first let's talk about what is

42
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,119
the difference between cryptocurrency

43
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,479
ecosystem and the uh and the traditional

44
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,979
security ecosystem

45
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,659
the best way to look at it is just look

46
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,340
through the economics of it

47
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,520
so when we talk about exploitation with

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,560
traditional security there are about

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,360
thousand or so incidents that happened

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,579
in last year on the blockchain side

51
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,420
there were about 294. so it's obviously

52
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,979
a much smaller industry so there are

53
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,020
less hacks where it gets interesting is

54
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,880
the dollar amounts involved in those

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,079
compromises

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,500
so the 4.6 billion dollar value that I

57
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,538
calculated it's pretty hard to find

58
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,819
because you can't go to some report of

59
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,920
it from Verizon or maindient or anyone

60
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,879
else out there that says you're like

61
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,140
this is how much money was actually

62
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,480
stolen would they concern themselves

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,860
more is like this is how many emails

64
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,239
were compromised so Social Security

65
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,760
numbers there's no actual dollar value

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,760
they can assign there so I extrapolated

67
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,459
based on the report from IBM which

68
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,319
counts about four million dollars per

69
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,360
incident things are different on the

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,819
blockchain side where because of the

71
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,560
nature of it because it's an open Ledger

72
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,480
you know exactly how much was in the

73
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,860
treasury of a company that was

74
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,720
compromised and suddenly it's not there

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,959
so from that I could see 3.7 billion

76
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,940
dollars that was in treasuries of

77
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,680
cryptocurrency businesses and now it's

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
gone

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,640
so what that means is that per incident

80
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,040
for businesses a single incident is

81
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,720
worth not just four million dollars in

82
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,580
traditional security but 12 million

83
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,519
dollars this is basically it's a

84
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,280
life-changing event for a company like

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,319
if it loses 12 million dollars a large

86
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,540
chunk of them shut down after the fact

87
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,060
so it is critical for businesses to

88
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,819
shore up the security

89
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,560
let's look at the attacker perspective

90
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,440
why are they so interested in hacking

91
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,300
crypto assets

92
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,879
same thing on traditional site thousand

93
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,080
incidents

94
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,000
the way that you can calculate attacker

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
profits that's really hard too the most

96
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,159
profitable like Cash Cow of traditional

97
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,980
compromises ransomware so ransomware 450

98
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,540
million dollars were stolen according to

99
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,599
cheat analysis if you're stealing uh you

100
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,879
know emails and all that stuff we saw in

101
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,459
a phishing talk yesterday you're selling

102
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,159
millions of records for pennies per

103
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,400
thousand or a million records so I would

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,640
say like I'm giving it like a big chunk

105
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,340
like big variance here about two million

106
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,260
dollars per Incident That's the attacker

107
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,340
profit

108
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,099
on the blockchain side it still is 12

109
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,959
million because the exact amount that

110
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,360
left the company's treasury now ends up

111
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,340
in the attacker's pocket

112
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,040
so naturally a lot of Bad actors a lot

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,659
of traditional Bad actors nation states

114
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,519
they did the same math and they said

115
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,380
well we can spend all this time trying

116
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,279
to go out our way steal steal identity

117
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,019
and try to go on the black market try to

118
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,639
sell that or we can just steal the

119
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,620
actual cash so it makes sense for them

120
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,820
to really Target this this field

121
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,540
so that's the math breakdown

122
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,160
let's talk about before we dive into

123
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,800
specific threats let's talk about on a

124
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,900
very high level what constitutes a

125
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,120
cryptocurrency ecosystem

126
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,040
uh from the defender in the attacker

127
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,960
side uh so of course there's the

128
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,520
blockchain like that's the underlying

129
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,380
technology this is the consensus

130
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,000
mechanism that allows you to do

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,800
transactions in a decentralized fashion

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
with no one being able to say no to you

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,720
those uh blockchains communicate with

134
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,400
notes which are specialized servers

135
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,979
which enforce the consensus so that

136
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:04,199
making sure that whatever The Ledger

137
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,419
state that appears on one side is the

138
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,680
same on the other

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,139
wallet software is the client software

140
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,419
which communicates with those notes so

141
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,979
that's what you and I would install in

142
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,000
our machines

143
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,580
smart contracts so those are tiny little

144
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,740
programs that run on all the nodes and

145
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,880
allow you to implement things like

146
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Banking and I guess decentralized

147
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,039
Banking and loans and all of that good

148
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,699
stuff without any central control

149
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,680
there are C5 businesses that's

150
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
centralized Finance so think of

151
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,860
exchanges

152
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,620
and D5 that's the most exciting part a

153
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,720
decentralized finance that's you you're

154
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,639
building up whole Banks and whole

155
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,060
ecosystems Financial ecosystems without

156
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,100
any single entity exerting control on

157
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:47,820
you

158
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,199
and of course there are users which

159
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,419
interact with all of that

160
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,220
with that let's look at what's happening

161
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,280
with this model so the slide shows you

162
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,259
how much was lost just this quarter in

163
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:59,639
the last three months

164
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,479
so on the user uh C5 and blockchain site

165
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,060
that's around 200 to uh sorry 20 to 30

166
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,560
million dollars lost

167
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,100
the real losses are in the D5 390

168
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,320
million dollars stolen in the last few

169
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,479
months and we can give to you this

170
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,100
number with Precision because we can

171
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,039
observe the act the projects actually

172
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,600
getting compromised and losing that

173
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,039
exact amount

174
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,900
and this is where we we're going to

175
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,380
focus for most of the talk this is where

176
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,419
attackers are most likely going to focus

177
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:32,100
because they're transitioning from

178
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,240
exchanges and other compromises to defy

179
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,580
and so we as Security Professionals

180
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,919
should focus on defending as well if we

181
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,800
want to contribute to this ecosystem

182
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,500
so let's begin with the user and wallet

183
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,060
Security First

184
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,660
so just on a very high level we have our

185
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,220
users who communicate to the client

186
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,900
software which is usually a browser

187
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,960
extension or mobile app the wall is

188
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,520
communicate to depths if you're not

189
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,100
familiar it's a just a website within

190
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,419
that website there's some embedded code

191
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,580
which can talk to those extensions you

192
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,500
can talk to your wallet software and

193
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,960
then wallets take commands from the DAP

194
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,419
like hey I want to swap some Eve and I

195
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,100
want to send it over to the blockchain

196
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,160
to visualize it imagine a wallet

197
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,319
software I'm biased here coinbase wallet

198
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:19,979
here

199
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,500
uh you navigate to adapt so this is

200
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,479
uniswap you're trying to switch you can

201
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,900
try to swap one eth for some usdc you

202
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,639
can't do it's no longer two thousand it

203
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,620
dropped in the last couple days

204
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,280
um you say go for it your wallet accepts

205
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,039
a command you approve that command to

206
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,039
perform the Swap and then it shows up on

207
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,300
the ledger so that's a blockchain

208
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,740
Explorer where you can see all the

209
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,660
transactions

210
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,360
and that gets us to the first and one of

211
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,479
the worst uh user threat vectors out

212
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,400
there it's called approval phishing you

213
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,840
can imagine that if you navigate to a

214
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,759
malicious website and oftentimes they

215
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,620
entice you with some kind of with some

216
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,419
kind of airdrop it's a it's a free

217
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,940
tokens that you can claim because you

218
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,500
are you and just for you will give you

219
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,960
some free stuff well little do you know

220
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,460
that when you navigate there and you

221
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,680
click on hey let's retrieve those tokens

222
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,240
you'll be presented with an approval

223
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,979
screen but that approval screen doesn't

224
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,080
authorize you receiving those tokens

225
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,960
because of how limited the ux is

226
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,419
oftentimes you approve things which end

227
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,240
up sending all your money on The Ledger

228
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,520
to the bad guys and then you end up with

229
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,620
an empty wallet and a sad face

230
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,139
and you say well couldn't users be

231
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,479
better well not really like Kevin Rose

232
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,120
has won recent hack and if you're

233
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,219
familiar Kevin rolls the Dig Fame he's

234
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,080
been he's been in the crypto ecosystem

235
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,179
for a while so he's an experienced user

236
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,620
OG we call them

237
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,740
and he was still tricked into losing a

238
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,019
million dollars worth of nfts for the

239
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,459
squiggly Alliance yes it's worth a

240
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,839
million dollars

241
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,300
um but the idea is like what are the

242
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,800
limitations of wallet software out there

243
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,140
that still tricks uh even more

244
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,120
experienced users uh by the way you'll

245
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,800
see QR codes I know we are at the

246
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,880
security conference and you're not

247
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,860
supposed to click on QR codes but you

248
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,240
know who I am and you know where to find

249
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,160
me this is just a way for you to get

250
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,660
more information

251
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,760
and more research on this particular

252
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,500
subject so it really sounds interesting

253
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,839
check it out

254
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,060
let's talk about zero transfer fishing

255
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,940
so that's another attack Vector the best

256
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,680
way to understand it imagine that you

257
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,820
called your bank

258
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,080
and then you want to call your bank

259
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,120
again and the best way to do this is you

260
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,279
look at the phone phone call history

261
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,680
right who do you call you remember like

262
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,300
the phone number started with 555

263
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,100
something and I'm gonna call this number

264
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,140
again well imagine that if attackers

265
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,240
could inject a number into your call

266
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,940
history which also start with 555 what

267
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,459
are the chances of you accidentally

268
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:46,019
dialing the bad number as opposed to the

269
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,000
original one and that is exactly what

270
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,380
attackers figured out how to do they

271
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,440
inject a a transaction with an address

272
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,180
which looks closely like your original

273
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,180
one but just slightly different

274
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,940
uh you approve a transaction a transfer

275
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,300
there and now your money is gone so this

276
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,880
is an example of a of a zero transfer

277
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,740
fish transaction you'll see the first

278
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,899
three characters five EC are the same

279
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,060
but then the rest is different so these

280
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,500
are called vanity addresses you can

281
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,839
Brute Force until you can calculate an

282
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,120
address which is similar enough

283
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,899
but it it surprisingly it's successful

284
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,360
enough that on ethereum blockchain uh

285
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,279
almost 20 million dollars were lost to

286
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,060
this to this hack in the past few months

287
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,339
okay so to summarize the state of user

288
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,740
and wallet security wallet ux needs

289
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,820
Improvement

290
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,160
um it's a new field people are barely

291
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,620
trying to get this going and

292
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,420
unfortunately bad guys are also taking

293
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,740
advantage of that

294
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,360
malicious transaction and address

295
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
detection is a huge growth opportunity

296
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,459
think of it like uh like a firewall or

297
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,260
anti-virus product but for

298
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,300
cryptocurrency users that tells them

299
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,220
like don't go there you know this chrome

300
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,019
big red screen that you get when you go

301
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,019
to a phishing site we need that if you

302
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,240
are Builder you're you want to create

303
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,920
something new this is an amazing

304
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,100
opportunity the other part is

305
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,899
investigations if someone compromises

306
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,220
your wallet who are you going to call

307
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,899
there are no maintenance or crowd

308
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:15,000
strikes or anyone else that you can call

309
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,459
it's volunteers volunteers right now sit

310
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,040
down and spend hours and hours of their

311
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,720
personal time to investigate and shut

312
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,300
down these hacks so again there are

313
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,920
opportunities for more Professional

314
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,260
Services there

315
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,060
no talk about blockchain Security will

316
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,339
be complete without exchanges so let's

317
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,740
talk about exchange security again I'm

318
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,180
not going to focus on more traditional

319
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,860
hacks like you know your server gets

320
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,660
compromised or someone somewhere

321
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,100
downloaded malware we'll talk about

322
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,040
blockchain specific threats and for that

323
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,620
just think of users communicating with

324
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,579
some kind of exchange backend over API

325
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,620
the key element and then the exchange

326
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,839
will forward on whatever it needs to to

327
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,980
the actual blockchain so they're

328
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,360
intermediary

329
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,000
the key thing to keep in mind are the

330
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,820
kind of uh asset storage that is

331
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,740
embedded inside we distinguish them

332
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,680
between hot storage hot wallets and cold

333
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,820
storage

334
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,339
hot wallets think of them as live data

335
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,380
that is accessible for users to

336
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,779
immediately quickly retrieve Swap and so

337
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,760
on and then you have cold storage Cold

338
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,500
Storage was introduced because exchanges

339
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,779
get hacked so if you do get hacked you

340
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:22,800
probably don't want to lose everything

341
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,480
you probably want to keep the majority

342
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,800
of your assets

343
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,680
somewhere offline which is very

344
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,660
difficult to retrieve requires all sorts

345
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,579
of steps that that is the common

346
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,700
practice at least for most exchanges

347
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,740
this gives you just some idea of how

348
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,019
exchange compromises go over time and

349
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,060
2022 would have been amazing if that's

350
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,860
for this one exchange which I'll cover

351
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,779
in detail shortly you can probably guess

352
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,399
who it was

353
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,860
but first the attack vectors on

354
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,260
exchanges hot wall compromise is by far

355
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,440
500 500 million dollars stolen in the

356
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,760
last uh year and year and a quarter

357
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,959
other things like server compromise

358
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,639
credentials theft credential theft is

359
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,040
more like API key theft that was popular

360
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,560
last year where One exchange like Ira

361
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,320
Financial was relying at API Keys stolen

362
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,760
from it from they were used to access

363
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,160
Gemini for Cold Storage server

364
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,480
compromise is more related like

365
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,639
incidents with uh Bitcoin ATM machines

366
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,220
like their whole info got hacked private

367
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,260
key stolen application logic

368
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,700
misconfiguration there are smaller

369
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,139
attack vectors they're more concerned

370
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,200
with like incorrectly said exchange

371
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,820
rates that attackers took advantage of

372
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,279
to Arbitrage

373
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,560
okay let's talk about FTX

374
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,519
um

375
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,980
if certain someone was not thinking

376
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,660
about

377
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,860
re-hypothetication they would have at

378
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,779
least implemented cold storage and as we

379
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,260
found out from the bankruptcy docs those

380
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,540
432 million dollars that were stolen

381
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,579
would maybe some portion of them would

382
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,600
have stayed

383
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,880
uh from chapter 11 bankruptcy docs no

384
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,760
security staff not using Cold Storage

385
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,639
Keys private Keys stored in clear text

386
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,740
multi-sig multi-sick wallets stored in

387
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,500
the same text file in clear text so like

388
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,560
really wild like I I can't believe this

389
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,399
was happening stolen assets were

390
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,139
extracted went through chip mixer North

391
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,060
Korea favorite not sure who it was but

392
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,940
one of the indicators and it's gone so

393
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,519
this is an extreme example of an actor

394
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,560
who was

395
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,300
extremely careless

396
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,060
uh let's talk about North Korea threat

397
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
actor apt-38

398
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,800
North Korean Lazarus group was

399
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,959
attributed to stealing 1.7 billion

400
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,040
dollars

401
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,680
so far in the last I guess five years or

402
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,420
so that they did the math that I showed

403
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,500
you early and said like wow we should

404
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,839
really start stealing crypto

405
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:43,620
um

406
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,199
their techniques that they use are more

407
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,000
traditional like they they don't create

408
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,160
like all day vulnerabilities and do all

409
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,339
sorts of like crazy stunts same old

410
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,740
malware spear fishing supply chain

411
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,199
attacks their latest invention is that

412
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,060
they apply for jobs at uh crypto

413
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,800
companies saying like hey hire me I'm an

414
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,440
American developer uh malicious Insider

415
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,660
you wanna anyways people have like all

416
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,399
sorts of weird YouTube recordings of the

417
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,680
conversations I invite you to research

418
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,839
that

419
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,060
ah so overall the state of exchange

420
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,899
security

421
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:18,300
hundreds of millions are lost that said

422
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,940
those hundreds of millions are still 14

423
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,500
of total losses in the crypto ecosystem

424
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,420
so you you definitely should if you're

425
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,760
interested as a career within the space

426
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,760
exchange security is great what I'm

427
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,320
going to talk about next is where the

428
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,959
real losses occur though supply chain

429
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,639
attacks spearfishing traditional attack

430
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,279
vectors are very much applicable and

431
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,899
whatever security profession you're

432
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:41,760
going to talk to like who is their

433
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,680
Boogie person that they wake up in the

434
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,760
middle of night sweating it's North

435
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,940
Korea they're thinking of Uncle Kim so

436
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,820
uh the state of protocol security

437
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,560
protocol security uh here we're talking

438
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,959
about blockchains the actual blockchain

439
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,760
protocols

440
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,560
um again on a high level you have a

441
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,820
bunch of notes

442
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,860
they all communicate the current state

443
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,139
to each other they uh like this is this

444
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,000
transaction occurred everyone should be

445
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,540
notified they get rid of bad states by

446
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,220
implementing variety of consensus

447
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,440
mechanisms from proof of work proof of

448
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,940
State I invite you to learn more about

449
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,279
that but the key element for the for our

450
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,320
purposes are the layers there's the

451
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,300
execution and consensus layer the

452
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,160
consensus layer concerns with making

453
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,440
sure that the larger state that they

454
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,899
obtain is legitimate and valid across

455
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:28,980
the ecosystem

456
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,839
this is agreeing on what transactions

457
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:32,279
are present and then we have the

458
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,440
execution State and I mentioned smart

459
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,540
contracts previously this is the layer

460
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,220
that makes sure that you execute those

461
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,139
tiny little programs in a secure fashion

462
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,839
and no funny business occurs because it

463
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,480
does if we look back in history let's go

464
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,180
back to 2021 the majority of attacks

465
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,000
were on the consensus layer so raise of

466
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,560
hand saw many are familiar with 51

467
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,399
percent reorg attacks quite a few okay

468
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,899
for those you're not sure about it's

469
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,940
basically the ability to trick the

470
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,699
system make a deposit to an exchange is

471
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,500
swap it out for something else and then

472
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,480
cheat and somehow that deposit like as

473
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,160
if never happened

474
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
no vulnerabilities back then were only

475
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,339
five million dollars it was just

476
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,319
starting out I was afraid it's going to

477
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,959
happen but it did the vast majority of

478
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,179
compromises today are as a result of

479
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,020
node exploitation so 700 million dollars

480
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,359
and then the on the consensus side

481
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,520
there's still consensus level exploits

482
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,959
but they changed they evolved into

483
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,179
something called Mev vulnerabilities

484
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,179
I'll talk about it in a second

485
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,700
so let's let's talk about first uh

486
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,860
attack Vector on the on the protocol

487
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,460
side Mev boost block leakage exploit

488
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,100
what is Mev mmev stands for maximally

489
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,960
extracted value it was previously called

490
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,820
minor extractable value but it's not as

491
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,260
politically correct so we don't we don't

492
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,460
say that anymore

493
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,440
think of it this way forget about crypto

494
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,539
let's talk about General Finance you're

495
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,520
familiar with Flash Boys the book where

496
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,860
people were buying data servers close to

497
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,940
exchanges to make sure they can

498
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,740
front-run legitimate Traders

499
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,840
same story Advanced traders in the

500
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,760
cryptocurrency they figure hey if I'm

501
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,620
going to pay this little bribe to a node

502
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,720
operator and I'm going to ask them to

503
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,160
include my transaction just before

504
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,500
another transaction or right after or

505
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,660
around this go to sandwich attack

506
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,760
I'm going to make some profit and the

507
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,140
whole industry was immediately born

508
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,620
where professional Traders would bribe

509
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,179
their way to include a transaction a

510
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,620
strategic place

511
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,900
now when it was disorganized in the

512
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,460
beginning you can imagine that node

513
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,160
operators could also front run the front

514
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,539
runner Traders like if they see a

515
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,400
profitable trade why not include your

516
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,860
own or why not drop that suggested trade

517
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,600
and keep all the money for yourself

518
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,840
so it was a mess and to address that a

519
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,240
more democratic system was introduced

520
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,640
where there's a proposer node which is

521
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,100
completely blind to those highly

522
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,440
profitable blocks that are proposed by

523
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,820
builders

524
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,179
and proposers their only job is to see

525
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,100
hey what's the biggest bribe from this

526
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,980
particular block I will choose that one

527
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,200
and forward onto a relayer a relayer now

528
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,720
can unwrap that block and forward onto a

529
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,460
note to actually mine

530
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,799
and all this works great proposers

531
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,559
cannot produce malicious blocks based on

532
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,539
what input they get as long as they're

533
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,640
not aware of what are the transactions

534
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,460
in that obfuscated block except for

535
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,559
April 3rd on April 3rd someone found a

536
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,120
vulnerability in this package that

537
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,580
facilitates this called Mev boost where

538
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,320
they figured out if they transmit a

539
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,500
broken block the relayer will take it

540
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,720
fail but it will still expose all the

541
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,059
transactions so what this one malicious

542
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,760
proposer did effectively they leaked the

543
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,440
contents of the block they included

544
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,760
their own transactions in there

545
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,039
rearrange the transactions and stole 25

546
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,660
million dollars from these Advanced

547
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,360
Traders meds and by the way we're not

548
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,860
talking about people manually putting

549
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,720
together blocks these are actual machine

550
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,660
code fully automated Bots that generate

551
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,220
those every few seconds

552
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:02,400
on the Node execution side so node

553
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,919
exploitation BSC token Hub is is a

554
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,260
perfect example the way that it works is

555
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,580
that you can imagine like you don't want

556
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,679
to implement everything as a as a

557
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,179
virtual machine you want to probably

558
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:14,160
embed some highly optimized code like to

559
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,380
calculate hashes Merkle tree

560
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,480
verification or other things deep inside

561
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,340
the node itself so it's running in go

562
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,960
code not in some kind of virtualized

563
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,539
machine so you can run it fast

564
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,460
was the case with the binance smart

565
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,160
chain where they decided to implement

566
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,500
iavl Merkle tree verification

567
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,340
key element this is used to produce like

568
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,580
a claim ticket to the uh to the node say

569
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,039
hey someone is asking me for 100 million

570
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,419
dollars and they're offering this

571
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,520
verification receipt is this thing legit

572
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,260
and the note is supposed to say yeah it

573
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,419
is legit go ahead give it give it the uh

574
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,039
give them the money well someone was

575
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,660
able to find an exploit and if you look

576
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,419
carefully at the source code here

577
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,580
this if else statement this is a case

578
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,460
where both sides of a tree are defined

579
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,640
they were expecting only one side

580
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,720
effectively I'll give you some more time

581
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,400
to look at it but effectively you can

582
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,940
sneak in an extra proof in next door to

583
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,100
the legitimate one that's exactly what

584
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,900
the attackers did they were able to

585
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,900
steal 586 million dollars half a billion

586
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,940
dollars this is a down Market this if we

587
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,740
were it happened a year ago that would

588
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,740
have been the first billion dollar hack

589
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,280
um

590
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,740
from from the binance uh smart chain

591
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,960
token Hub they effectively created a

592
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,480
ticket a claim ticket that said hey you

593
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,200
owe me 2 trillion binance tokens and the

594
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,360
smart contract here obliged because the

595
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,880
node was uh the no proof verification

596
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,919
was vulnerable

597
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:43,380
so to zoom out state of protocol

598
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,440
security no one does 51 of reorg attacks

599
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,659
anymore that's in the past

600
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,659
I really was wondering if governance and

601
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,520
staking uh proof of stake attacks would

602
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,760
take over but that didn't really happen

603
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,440
the real game here our virtual machine

604
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,659
and node exploitation so if you want to

605
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:01,740
spend time researching for

606
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,360
vulnerabilities

607
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,559
um that's where you're going to find the

608
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,620
most deadly bugs

609
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,980
and that gets us to the state of defy

610
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,380
security this is by far the largest

611
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,340
field so let's spend more time on this

612
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,700
so just to give you a mental picture uh

613
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,700
D5 protocols we have users they're

614
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,260
interacting with dapps so these are

615
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,120
these web applications where you can

616
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,140
talk to let's say a lending protocol

617
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,480
uh daps talk to wallets so that's your

618
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,760
interface to the blockchain and then you

619
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,220
have blockchains that communicate with

620
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,780
smart contracts this is where this is

621
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,299
the Divide where the D5 ecosystem begins

622
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,280
those smart contracts can Implement all

623
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,620
sorts of things from uh Landing

624
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,140
borrowing protocols swaps you can

625
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,179
leverage your Investments and Flash

626
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,159
loans all sorts of fascinating things I

627
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,960
invite you to explore

628
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,960
contracts do not exist in vacuum in fact

629
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,880
it's a feature that they all stack and

630
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,020
interact with each other it's called

631
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,820
composability

632
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,919
one particular type of smart contracts

633
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,659
that I want to talk about are called

634
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,419
oracles they provide the ability for

635
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,400
blockchains to receive external data or

636
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,559
they provide information like what is

637
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,179
the current exchange rate like you know

638
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,820
if you're trying to swap eth for usdc or

639
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,159
what's the current price

640
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,600
and of course we have to talk about

641
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,700
admins so if you compromise

642
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,299
administrative Keys which happen

643
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:29,100
that control Smart contracts you can

644
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,900
empty whatever treasuries are inside

645
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,700
those smart contracts or do all sorts of

646
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,740
interesting things

647
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,900
so this is kind of a limited model I

648
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,760
just included just enough to talk about

649
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,039
a couple of use cases that I'm going to

650
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,120
discuss

651
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,820
so let's talk about Chain Bridge hacks

652
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,340
and the reason why these particular

653
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,620
hacks are so relevant is that there's

654
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,480
just a few of them but they're so costly

655
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,299
you saw that binance smart chain uh

656
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,400
compromise that was a bridge compromise

657
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,679
and it was immediately half a billion

658
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,360
dollars poof gone

659
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,700
the reason why Bridges exist is that we

660
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,860
no longer live in a world where there's

661
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,380
a Bitcoin Network an ethereum Network

662
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,179
and that's about it maybe a couple more

663
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:12,120
there are hundreds of chains out there

664
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,799
so if you're a user and you purchase

665
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,559
some token on let's say ethereum but you

666
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,600
want to do transactions on another chain

667
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,340
maybe they offer cheaper transaction

668
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,840
fees or different security

669
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,880
characteristics or different speed of

670
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,400
transactions whatever the reason you

671
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,440
want to transfer your tokens from one

672
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,659
chain into another you do this using

673
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:31,799
Bridges

674
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,020
the way the bridges work imagine that

675
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,539
you have some usdc on the ethereum

676
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:37,380
network

677
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,679
you will use bridges on both sides of

678
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,080
the network in this case it's polygon to

679
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,419
transfer that asset the way that it

680
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:48,240
works you send the usdc to the bridge

681
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,780
the bridge takes in your usdc holds on

682
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,360
to it in the liquidity pool and then

683
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,780
from there it mints a new usdc token on

684
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,480
the other side which is sent to you now

685
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,460
you'll immediately see wow those bridges

686
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,280
they hold on to all that usdc and other

687
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,500
tokens that they receive from users

688
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,480
you can see why attackers are interested

689
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,700
in this because they hold on to a lot of

690
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,760
it that's where the huge liquidity pools

691
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,539
holding on to all the user tokens there

692
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,400
and that gets us to the first exploit

693
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,860
the Wormhole compromise and this one is

694
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,900
just so fascinating from so many

695
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,159
directions

696
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,260
similar to the binance smart chain hack

697
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,360
that we discussed earlier there was an

698
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,799
issue with the proof verification

699
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,539
someone was able to craft an account

700
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:36,480
with a specific characteristic check out

701
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,000
the QR code for more details effectively

702
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,460
they were able to cheat and claim more

703
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,900
assets from the bridge that they were

704
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,440
allowed to in this case 325 million

705
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,880
dollars worth

706
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,559
they stole it on the Solana Network

707
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,720
transferred over to ethereum

708
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,340
but this is where it gets really

709
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,559
interesting

710
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:58,860
so on the Wormhole a year later

711
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,960
normally when you see what attackers do

712
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,940
after those compromises they use tornado

713
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,799
cash or they find some exchange without

714
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,480
a kyc requirement and they start

715
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,299
swapping it laundering and so on not

716
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,700
this one this guy was really really

717
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,600
wanted to extract maximum value so what

718
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,480
they did as a true DJ and DJ like just

719
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,100
people who are like doing crazy things

720
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,500
on on these uh on these networks is a

721
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,140
true d-gen they decided to take 120 000

722
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,200
eth and put it up as collateral on Oasis

723
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,100
Network

724
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,500
they took that as a collateral and then

725
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,539
they borrowed whole bunch of

726
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:36,840
our eth and staked eth and if you're not

727
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,240
familiar these are just ethereum tokens

728
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,100
but they're interest-bearing ethereum

729
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,740
tokens so not only did they steal 120

730
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,539
000 eth now they're earning interest on

731
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,460
what they stole so they're like really

732
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,200
cashing in here

733
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,679
except because they did this lending

734
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:55,679
thing there's always a risk of your loan

735
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,020
going underwater and we'll cover lending

736
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,460
protocols shortly

737
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,220
if your loan goes underwater you may get

738
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,960
liquidated that means you may lose all

739
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,640
of your collateral

740
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,279
and to prevent that there exists

741
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,080
specialized Bots they're called stop

742
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,539
loss Bots which you delegate access to

743
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,520
your token so if your loan is just about

744
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,980
to go underwater these Bots will step in

745
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,840
liquidate your loan before you lose

746
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,039
anything

747
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,960
the one thing the attackers did not

748
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,720
figure for is that the stop loss Bots

749
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,760
were also controlled by the Oasis

750
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,279
Network in the Oasis Network had admin

751
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,919
keys for that bot that means they could

752
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,159
potentially change it in such a way that

753
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:36,539
they could reclaim those funds and

754
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,220
that's exactly what happened they

755
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,020
upgraded a white a bunch of white hats

756
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,520
figured out that hey these guys are

757
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,200
going full DJ and they just deposited

758
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,580
and they delegated access to their

759
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,380
tokens to this new contract which you

760
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,720
have admin keys for could you maybe hack

761
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,640
your contract and you know steal those

762
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,539
back

763
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,919
sure

764
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,400
upgrade went through they stole those

765
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,659
assets from the attacker who was

766
00:27:57,659 --> 00:27:58,799
probably sitting there what the hell

767
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,539
just happened I got hacked

768
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,539
they restored the loan took back the

769
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:06,539
original Eve plus actual 17 000 extra e

770
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,700
that they earned in interest and gave it

771
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,799
back to the Wormhole protocol

772
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,799
this type of stuff only happens in D5

773
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,159
this is the this is the wild west guys

774
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,480
this is just one example of white hat

775
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,980
attacks again there are a lot of

776
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,539
volunteers that sit there and they

777
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,279
constantly Monitor and watch for attacks

778
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,260
on it's a public ledger so you can see

779
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,820
the attack live happening in front of

780
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,679
your eyes so a lot of white hats what

781
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,179
they started doing is that they actually

782
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,620
the second they see the first

783
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,360
transaction of a hack they will swoop in

784
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,559
and start hacking the protocol

785
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,360
themselves and then they'll give

786
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,039
whatever money that they recovered back

787
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,320
to the protocol

788
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,299
um so there's there's a whole

789
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:43,740
interesting and the best part is that

790
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,240
once again you can see all this

791
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,620
happening live in front of your eyes

792
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,600
transaction after transaction

793
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,179
pretty fascinating

794
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:52,679
okay

795
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,820
um let's talk about lending protocols uh

796
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,059
so lending protocol I guess why do

797
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,679
lending protocols even exist first like

798
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,360
imagine you have one million dollars

799
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,220
worth of Eve and you want to buy a house

800
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,520
not in San Francisco far away

801
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,419
um

802
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:11,940
so your one option is you take your 1

803
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,640
million each and then you sell it you

804
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,220
pay 30 40 in taxes now you have around

805
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,679
like maybe 600k so you got your down

806
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,960
payment you got a mortgage cool the

807
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,279
other way you can do this is you can

808
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,600
take your million dollars worth of wheat

809
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,940
eat and uh

810
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,419
well

811
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,720
uh

812
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,940
and you can put it up as collateral and

813
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,039
you put out as a collateral and withdraw

814
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,919
one million dollars worth of usdc so now

815
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,559
instead of paying your interest rates to

816
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,299
some mortgage company Fannie Mae or

817
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,279
whatever you can actually pay to this

818
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,720
lending protocol which is probably a few

819
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,340
percent it's decentralized they're not

820
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,380
going to confiscate your your mortgage

821
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,460
if they're pissed at you or something

822
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,260
like that

823
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,179
um and that's great you just got a house

824
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,580
million dollars that's cool uh lending

825
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,760
protocols when they give you this uh

826
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,559
loan internally they keep your

827
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,419
collateral and they also keep track to

828
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:10,440
make sure that the the ratio between the

829
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,440
uh the collateral and how much usdc they

830
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,720
gave you remains at least a one to one

831
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,740
ratio

832
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,059
the reason they need to do this is

833
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:20,100
because this is all permissionless they

834
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,960
don't have your kyc there's neural

835
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,240
mechanisms that they can go and find you

836
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,240
like hey give me back my loan or

837
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,500
Institute a legal action that's not the

838
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,840
whole point of D5

839
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,480
but imagine a scenario that within this

840
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,460
ratio what if eth drops like it did in a

841
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,720
couple days

842
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,360
and now your loan is underwater while

843
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,179
lending protocols they implemented a

844
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,740
mechanism where they get rid of bad

845
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,779
loans

846
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:47,340
once they go underwater and the way that

847
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,080
the smart contracts cannot call

848
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,720
themselves so the what they invented is

849
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,940
they created a liquidation Market where

850
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,159
they incentivized Bots the smart

851
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,080
contracts or individuals

852
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,700
to come in

853
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,260
with some of their own usdc pay off the

854
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,080
um the collateral uh pay off the loan

855
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,020
for for uh for that user and then

856
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,559
reclaim the uh the collateral so a

857
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,200
liquidator comes in gives some usdc take

858
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,360
over all of the users collateral

859
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,640
and now we are solid

860
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,559
you may ask what's the incentive the

861
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,440
incentive here is that they obtain the

862
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,200
initial collateral at a discount

863
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,840
so instead of putting up million dollars

864
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,480
worth of usdc to purchase that million

865
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,299
dollars worth of if they put in maybe 99

866
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:39,299
or 98 and that's their profit

867
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,419
now the more underwater is the loan the

868
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:44,159
more incentives The Lending protocol

869
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,559
must give in order for someone to swoop

870
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,140
in and give up that loan

871
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,600
and that's where that's something like

872
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,299
you can imagine like normally this this

873
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,460
whole action occurs

874
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,919
just the second the loan even approaches

875
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,279
a um a liquidation point

876
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,380
um and then that discount is basically

877
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,940
compensated but whatever fees are

878
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,320
involved when you first originate the

879
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,940
loan so the lending protocol is made

880
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,159
whole Liquidator makes some money user

881
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,039
uh keeps their initial like borrowed

882
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,960
assets everyone is happy

883
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,760
but imagine there is a Black Swan event

884
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,460
and it really drops under

885
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,760
now the Liquidator comes in gets a huge

886
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,799
let's say up to 20 discount on some

887
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,500
protocols that we'll discuss shortly

888
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,179
gets that huge discount but what happens

889
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:33,360
with 20 percent discount on the lending

890
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,640
protocol side they have to hold on to it

891
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,020
because no one's going to buy it and

892
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,419
it's called Bat debt lending protocols

893
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:42,960
hate accumulating bad debt

894
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,320
so with that knowledge in mind uh let's

895
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,659
talk about Euler protocol compromise on

896
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:50,820
March 13th Euler Finance

897
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,640
a landing protocol lost 197 million

898
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,559
dollars and the reason they were able

899
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,360
they lost all of that is that they

900
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,700
introduced a function and Method called

901
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,399
donate to reserves the method allows you

902
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,679
to take your collateral and effectively

903
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,799
burn it and burn arbitrary amounts of it

904
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,200
so they created this feature because as

905
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,419
you do borrowing and Landing you slowly

906
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,880
start accumulating all sorts of uh junk

907
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,919
and you want to get rid of it just it

908
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:18,779
was a cleanup function what they didn't

909
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,640
realize and account for

910
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,919
what happens to the to the loan if you

911
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,899
start burning the collateral

912
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:26,760
and arbitrary amounts of collateral you

913
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,919
can force your loan to go severely

914
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,840
underwater so you have this million to

915
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,940
million loan and you just burned half a

916
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,740
million off collateral now your loan is

917
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,720
underwater Oh what are you going to do

918
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,580
with that well you're going to say well

919
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,200
Liquidators are going to come in they're

920
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,360
going to take a cut but what's the

921
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,620
benefit what's the profit to the

922
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,899
attacker there is none they just burn

923
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,340
some of their collateral and they lost

924
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,899
lost all of it now

925
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:50,940
except the Euler protocol introduced

926
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,760
another feature which is called minting

927
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,860
or leveraging you can take your initial

928
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,419
million dollars

929
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,460
and you can leverage it up to 20 times

930
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,220
so now you have 20 million dollars of

931
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,899
debt and collateral which you need to

932
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:06,480
pay off but you can do this for all

933
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,339
sorts of things you can enable Short

934
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,560
Selling mechanisms and so on

935
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,899
so now you have a 20 million in

936
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,099
collateral

937
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,199
and the protocol and he forced it to go

938
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,300
underwater and the protocol can give you

939
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,639
up to 20 discount so you can you can

940
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,399
make uh 20 of 20 Millions around four

941
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,699
million dollars so uh sorry 200 up to

942
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,918
four hundred thousand so you can you can

943
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:31,679
slowly accumulate the profits beyond

944
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,679
what you initially uh sorry it is sorry

945
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,540
20 million dollars twenty percent four

946
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,399
million dollars four million dollars

947
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,480
from the initial million dollar

948
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,179
collateral so you put in one million and

949
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,580
you just forexed it pretty profitable so

950
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,260
the attackers were able to use that and

951
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,119
abuse this feature to effectively go

952
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,918
token by token that it was offered by

953
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,899
this protocol and empty it 200 million

954
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:52,739
dollars

955
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:55,080
but again there's a reason why I'm

956
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,760
talking about this protocol because it's

957
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,339
not so much the hack it's what happens

958
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,140
next

959
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,839
so let's talk about me V bot so briefly

960
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,280
mentioned that

961
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,560
briefly mentioned that there are these

962
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,720
machines that are sitting watching all

963
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,000
the transactions on chain for anything

964
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,800
profitable and you know it's a really

965
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,380
profitable transaction an exploit you

966
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,940
run this thing and you generate a whole

967
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,460
bunch of profit and such was the case

968
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,660
here so the attacker uh on March 13th 8

969
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,800
50 a.m in 23 seconds deployed an exploit

970
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,180
contract

971
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,880
four minutes later they perform the

972
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,920
actual exploit why do they wait so long

973
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,960
what happened in those four minutes well

974
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,060
the second they deployed the exploit

975
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,859
contract and bought

976
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,320
detected at a deployment understood that

977
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,660
it's profitable and decided to redeploy

978
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,300
it so at 8 50 35 seconds that's exactly

979
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,160
12 seconds after the initial deployment

980
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,800
some machine fit simulated the whole

981
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,619
thing figured out it's an exploit

982
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,119
redeployed the contract and then a few

983
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,040
seconds later actually ran the exploit

984
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,920
and Fran ran the attacker

985
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,240
and all they had to do they

986
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,740
automatically went into the byte code

987
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,599
just the sophistication of those things

988
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,760
they went into the contract there was

989
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,200
some access controls built in they

990
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,720
automatically replaced the bike cult to

991
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,760
make sure that they can run this code

992
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,900
themselves

993
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,240
and try to extract The Profit they were

994
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,440
not successful in this case

995
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,780
unfortunately because the attacker built

996
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,579
in all sorts of hard-coded addresses so

997
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:26,280
in the end in this particular case the

998
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,740
Mev bot ended up sending money back to

999
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,720
the attacker for which they put out

1000
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,460
Unchained message apologizing profusely

1001
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,619
but the point is not even attackers are

1002
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,720
safe from those things they constantly

1003
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,220
sit on chain and they they attack

1004
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,680
everyone if it's profitable exploit or

1005
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,320
not they will Target you

1006
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,480
but the story does not end there

1007
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,760
there is a happy end

1008
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,020
uh

1009
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,480
the normal operating procedure after a

1010
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,339
D5 hack occurs

1011
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:56,160
is is that people start communicating

1012
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,440
with attackers a lot of them are begging

1013
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,540
like oh this was my entire life savings

1014
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,400
could you pretty please give me my money

1015
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,980
back and so on and on so the way that a

1016
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,079
sample transaction looks like is you can

1017
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:10,140
put arbitrary data including ASCII codes

1018
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,599
in a transaction you can transfer like

1019
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,180
maybe 0.001 eth to get attention from

1020
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,859
the attackers

1021
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,780
in this case it was an ASCII code from

1022
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,700
Euler deployer so this is the Euler

1023
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,380
people themselves and they put in

1024
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,420
message again standard operating

1025
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,180
procedure hey you hacked us haha good

1026
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,240
job uh you know if you keep 90 of the

1027
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,700
profits sorry if you give us 90 of the

1028
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,460
profits and keep 10 for yourself you

1029
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,859
know we promise not to pursue further

1030
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,380
legal action

1031
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,780
um and in this case I again invite you

1032
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,339
to visit this link we just put out a

1033
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:47,220
blog post part one which dives into this

1034
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,000
thing

1035
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,339
fascinating story involving somehow

1036
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:53,520
North Korea and you know backstabbing

1037
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,920
this is this is defy land this is pretty

1038
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,320
wild the way there culminates is the

1039
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,280
attacker

1040
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,040
put out a message Jacob here I'm sorry

1041
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,380
I'm not sure what I did I'm sorry for

1042
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,960
messing people's money and ended up

1043
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,140
returning all of it

1044
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,579
um and that's that brings up another

1045
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,980
interesting point is that this bounty

1046
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,740
thing works uh again there are a bunch

1047
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,140
of volunteers that sit on chain look for

1048
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,480
those hacks and then they dox the hell

1049
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,579
out of the attackers if by some mistake

1050
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:25,980
an attacker interacted with a

1051
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,359
centralized exchange where they can

1052
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,940
extract kyc or in fact if the attackers

1053
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,280
used metamask so metamask is a common

1054
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,099
wallet but if you recall back to when I

1055
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:36,780
was introducing the model you don't just

1056
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,760
send messages directly to the blockchain

1057
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,460
you go through centralized servers and

1058
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,780
what do centralized service have access

1059
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,420
to your IP addresses and your addresses

1060
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,220
and they do collect them

1061
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,960
so there are a lot of opportunities for

1062
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,839
the good guys to catch the bad guys

1063
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:52,680
um

1064
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,260
and worst case there are rewards that

1065
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,940
are that are put up there so in the case

1066
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,680
of the Wormhole they were able to

1067
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,359
reclaim it a year later and in this case

1068
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:02,579
they were able to effectively Force the

1069
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,320
attacker to return all the assets this

1070
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,060
happens more often than not that the

1071
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,980
same scenario played out a couple times

1072
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,079
since March incident

1073
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,640
okay I'm not gonna have time to talk

1074
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,579
about all the different exploit vectors

1075
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,720
what I do want to point out this is

1076
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,880
think of as like o wasp top 10 style

1077
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,220
list uh what I do want to point out is

1078
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,560
stolen private Keys the North Korean

1079
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,900
style hack where they go in and get all

1080
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,099
the keys and extract them from your

1081
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,440
contract that's probably by far the most

1082
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,380
painful methods that said the most

1083
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,940
frequently occurring method is probably

1084
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,920
price Oracle manipulation so remember

1085
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,320
that price Oracle node that gives you

1086
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,060
price data where people figure out all

1087
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,560
sorts of ways to manipulate the price

1088
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,300
data to make sure that they can do

1089
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,660
interesting uh creative Arbitrage

1090
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,880
so I invite you to learn more about

1091
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,880
these attack vectors

1092
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,079
so overall the state of D5 security

1093
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,560
we lost 3.7 billion dollars in 2022 I do

1094
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,180
see the same attack vectors being used

1095
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,560
again and again so there's definitely a

1096
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,440
gap in security staff security

1097
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,160
development processes and tooling when

1098
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,740
targets when when D5 project gets hacked

1099
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,540
there's also a lack in incident response

1100
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,040
and monitoring processes oftentimes

1101
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,540
these projects recognize that they were

1102
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,980
hacked because someone tweeted them like

1103
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,680
hey project XYZ you may want to look at

1104
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,599
this transaction

1105
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,220
um that that's your incident response

1106
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,680
that's obviously lacking but there

1107
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,040
there's there's good future in that in

1108
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,400
building those response capabilities

1109
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,619
um and then the other concern is just

1110
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:39,240
overloaded audit companies there are

1111
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,460
specialized audit firms that exist they

1112
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,680
can look for those bugs but there's so

1113
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,079
few of them the professionals are it's

1114
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,060
just so hard to bring someone into this

1115
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,760
field that most of them are booked for

1116
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,820
months and maybe a year ahead so in the

1117
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,859
case of the Euler Finance debug that was

1118
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,540
introduced that resulted in the exploit

1119
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,480
they added this feature after the audits

1120
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,579
were done and quite simply because it

1121
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:04,740
takes months to get something audited so

1122
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,200
they just added it

1123
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,060
okay let's talk quickly about the state

1124
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,000
of block SEC ecosystem or if you if this

1125
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,800
sounds interesting to you what what you

1126
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,839
could build on

1127
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,460
uh so I already mentioned audit

1128
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,020
companies there are hundreds of them I'm

1129
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,940
only listing just a few most of them

1130
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,800
popped up in the last year or two so if

1131
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,780
you want to learn and pick up the skill

1132
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,000
there's just such lack of them that

1133
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,060
individual Auditors are making like

1134
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,160
pretty good living like you can I've

1135
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,079
seen people pick up this field maybe a

1136
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,280
few months ago and they're already

1137
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,320
full-time booked

1138
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,599
uh tooling could be built there are bug

1139
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,760
Bounty programs now like immunify code

1140
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,160
for arena all exist in the last couple

1141
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,680
years it's a brand new field

1142
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,280
um

1143
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,040
in terms of monitoring there again last

1144
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,079
year so we've seen some solutions which

1145
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,900
use machine learning they use uh just

1146
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,000
the ability to detect that transaction

1147
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,380
is malicious

1148
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,720
decode a transaction the risk algorithms

1149
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,400
that tell you that hey this lending

1150
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,619
protocol thing that you're building is

1151
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:06,000
you probably want to look at again

1152
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,099
insurance companies deal with inevitable

1153
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:09,960
hacks so you can insure yourself in case

1154
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,060
there's a compromise and so on

1155
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,060
wallet security exploded seemingly in

1156
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,460
the last few months and that's basically

1157
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,780
dealing with how many people are getting

1158
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,180
fished so they're creating these

1159
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,940
crypto firewalls if you will to alert

1160
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,040
user that something is amiss

1161
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,720
forensics companies and incident

1162
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,640
response are still they're just a few

1163
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,359
that are fairly old but not not too many

1164
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,460
new players

1165
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,020
let's talk about security Community

1166
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,660
security Community is amazing their

1167
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,579
Capture the Flag competition they're a

1168
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:45,240
dedicated conferences just for D5 and

1169
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,160
blockchain security their newsletters

1170
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,020
Shameless plug this one that I'm running

1171
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,660
block thread.io wrecked and others that

1172
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,280
go in details over exactly what's

1173
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,900
happening who was compromised how would

1174
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,980
they compromised what's the latest

1175
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,440
research people in the community are

1176
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,720
warm they share knowledge they welcome

1177
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,000
new folks joining us

1178
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,839
foreign

1179
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,420
that said if any of that sounds

1180
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,680
interesting to you and you're kind of

1181
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,780
sick with the same old security stuff

1182
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,819
that you do like no more exercises okay

1183
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:13,500
yet another exercise that's cool you

1184
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,760
want to do something completely wild

1185
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,460
Hunt down people live on chain

1186
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,339
join explore this ecosystem as a smart

1187
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,560
contract auditor on chain investigator

1188
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,960
to figure out who the bad guys are uh

1189
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,060
security Engineers incident responders

1190
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,060
are probably much needed

1191
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,859
and with that I'll give you some time

1192
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,300
for questions

1193
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,960
yes

1194
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,520
what does that mean but the question is

1195
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,020
modular blockchain security what does

1196
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,319
that mean

1197
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:59,280
sure uh Layer Two blockchains

1198
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,440
effectively ethereum evolved as a

1199
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,819
primary blockchain

1200
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:04,920
but everyone is using it so the fees

1201
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,660
start going up so people start

1202
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,460
introducing additional layers where you

1203
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,440
can offload some of the capacity to

1204
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,720
those layer 2 blockchains that way you

1205
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,220
reduce the fees increase the speed

1206
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,599
there's some trade-offs with security

1207
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,060
sometimes but

1208
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,040
um

1209
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,140
it depends on the protocol some

1210
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,000
Implement zero knowledge proof switchers

1211
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,040
very secure but kind of slow some

1212
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,920
Implement centralized nodes centralized

1213
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,720
sequences and architecture and that's

1214
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,579
very fast but very centralized so less

1215
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:35,160
secure so all sorts of trade-offs uh

1216
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,900
there's a resource I'll remember I'll

1217
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,720
tell you in a bit that measures and

1218
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,060
Compares them

1219
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,980
yeah that's that's the future that's

1220
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,140
where a lot of stuff is happening right

1221
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,980
now any other questions

1222
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,720
all right

1223
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,099
there's one coming up

1224
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,680
uh there's one coming up in France it's

1225
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,780
called D5 security Summit

1226
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,760
I would recommend that one that said

1227
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,420
every um there are like eth ethereum

1228
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,859
conferences which happening there's one

1229
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:12,720
in San Francisco coming up I think in

1230
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,760
like later in the year and they always

1231
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,740
have security track talks so I would

1232
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,500
just go to General crypto conference and

1233
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,880
just there's always someone talking

1234
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,740
about different threats in attacks

1235
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,619
all right thank you folks
