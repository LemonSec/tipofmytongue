exciting

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,579
this is going to be a kind of rough

24
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,820
looking at a cell phone okay so I want

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,460
to do a really quick thank you to B-side

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,220
San Francisco to your staff the

27
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,920
volunteers the sponsors everyone

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,080
involved this is a big event to put on

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,360
so let's give them a little round of

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,780
applause

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,299
okay

32
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,580
and due to timing I'm going to leave

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,920
this open hopefully it stays on so that

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,680
I can make sure I get this wrapped up on

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,259
time all right so thank you everyone

36
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,979
do you remember the first time you

37
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,740
discovered something new or saw

38
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,479
something from a different perspective

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,259
well I do I was a very very small girl

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,960
and I was having a hard time learning

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,079
the difference between my left hand and

42
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,600
my right hand for some reason I just

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,119
couldn't tell them apart so one day a

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,560
teacher came up to me and they're like

45
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,939
hey

46
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,640
if you look at your hand it is shaped

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,399
like the letter L and right then and

48
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,579
there my life was forever changed I

49
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,979
never looked at my left hand the same

50
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,560
way again and just like that those

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,160
feelings of awe and Discovery and just

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,440
learning something new I hope you get to

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,720
reconnect with that and have those type

54
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,300
of experiences this weekend through

55
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,239
conversations with other professionals

56
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,319
so what is this talk about well besides

57
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,120
San Francisco they reached out to me and

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,400
they're like we want you to talk about

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,560
cyber threat intelligence and I'm like

60
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,879
OMG yes I love cyber threat intelligence

61
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,280
so we hopped on the phone we started

62
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,260
talking and I started going like this

63
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,580
because we needed to come up with a

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,400
topic and I realized I kind of felt like

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,319
that Meme of It's Always Sunny in

66
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,420
Philadelphia talking about all the Cyber

67
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,660
threats so in that moment besides San

68
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,280
Francisco and I were like that's it

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,940
that's it so bam a couple of emails

70
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,879
later and we got the title The expanding

71
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,459
Universe of cyber threats and that's how

72
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,920
this presentation was born

73
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,920
so I I thought to myself I'm like what

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,860
do I have to bring to this topic what do

75
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,319
I want to share with everyone well

76
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,560
I realized that I have a story to share

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,140
about the Cyber threat intelligence wins

78
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,900
that I've had the opportunity to observe

79
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,480
in my career so you all get to hear

80
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,060
about that and I also wanted to

81
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,819
encourage people to engage their

82
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:31,920
internal cyber threat intelligence team

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,819
or CTI team and if you don't have one to

84
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,980
possibly think about standing up your

85
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,560
own cyber threat intelligence function

86
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,860
so if you're like me you think about the

87
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,900
problem of the expanding Universe of

88
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,000
cyber threats and you're like man

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,099
there's just so many every single week

90
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,739
every single Patch Tuesday something new

91
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,299
is coming out

92
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,700
and so you think about the limitations

93
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,400
of either people process technology and

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,260
you're like all right I there's no way

95
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,940
in the world I can address all of these

96
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,319
cyber threats

97
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,640
so with that I want to challenge you to

98
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,340
look at the expanding Universe of cyber

99
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,799
threats as an opportunity

100
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,260
and what I hope you get out of this talk

101
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,199
is inspiration to explore new or

102
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,579
existing things from a different

103
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,639
perspective and to discover something

104
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,360
incredible

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,620
so I heard from a friend that in space

106
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,560
no one can hear you scheme except for

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,560
lawyers so with that I am here in my own

108
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,199
individual capacity I'm not speaking on

109
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,840
behalf of my employers everything I say

110
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,020
do any vendor I mention is solely my

111
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,639
opinion all right

112
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,000
hopefully that checked that box

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,120
so thank you besides San Francisco to

114
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,040
read for the really wonderful

115
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,440
introduction but I wanted to add a

116
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,660
little bit more context for you guys so

117
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,820
I've been in cyber threat intelligence

118
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,979
as an official paid career where I made

119
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,320
money full-time for a little over five

120
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,139
years and prior to that I wore many hats

121
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,780
but I came from a small business realm

122
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,699
and so with that why I'm sharing this

123
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,040
with you is that I tend to approach

124
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,560
things from a business perspective where

125
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,660
I try to focus on providing business

126
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,759
value so if you're wondering if it

127
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,520
sounds a little mba-ish please excuse my

128
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,320
MBA but it really is my business

129
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,880
experience

130
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,220
so in this cyber career what I've

131
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,940
learned so far is that there is not a

132
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,380
one-size-fits all for anything and

133
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,259
there's kind of no one right way to do

134
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,199
something so in this talk I'd love for

135
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,360
you to have an open mind we're here to

136
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,639
have fun we're here to explore and we'll

137
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,740
we're here to kick off a really awesome

138
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,520
conference

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,460
so I'm gonna talk a little bit about

140
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,440
space so in 1961 JFK had a really

141
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,479
awesome speech if you get a chance you

142
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,000
like great speeches check it out it was

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,100
the space exploration speech at Rice

144
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,979
University where basically he said hey

145
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,440
everyone guess what we are gonna go to

146
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,860
the moon in less than a decade and just

147
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,100
pause with me for a second and imagine

148
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,979
no one's ever ever done that before and

149
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,600
they're saying in less than 10 years

150
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,180
we're going to the moon and you're like

151
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,800
yeah he's crazy

152
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,819
uh so actually fast forward in 1969 that

153
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,340
was approximately eight years later not

154
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,740
only did we go to the moon but we also

155
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,620
walked on the moon how crazy is that

156
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,740
so when that happened I feel it

157
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,259
absolutely changed the world and changed

158
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,039
what was possible for everyone

159
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,740
and similar to the moon landing where

160
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,360
essentially when that was happening

161
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,780
eagle or Apollo 11's lunar module had

162
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,840
about 20 seconds left of Landing Fuel

163
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,080
and so all the people on Earth you know

164
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,060
in today's Earth Day happy Earth Day by

165
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,979
the way all the people on Earth were

166
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,199
like whoa ah and they didn't really

167
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,840
understand the actual threat that was

168
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,180
going on and so cyber security is a lot

169
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,940
like that where all of us you know we

170
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,919
operate in the background we operate in

171
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,259
the shadows we make sure stuff is

172
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,259
patched in time we we investigate

173
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,419
anomalous activity like all the things

174
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,819
and we ensure that the business keeps

175
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,740
running and the customers and the

176
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,720
general population are blissfully

177
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,599
unaware that we exist

178
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,160
so

179
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,539
in a world

180
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,360
where the expanding Universe of threats

181
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,419
is an actual reality because it is we

182
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,300
become the Cyber equivalent of the Cyber

183
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,880
Explorer similar to the astronauts and

184
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,699
the engineers and NASA and everyone that

185
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,120
was involved in getting us to the Moon

186
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,240
so we are the adventurers the innovators

187
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,599
the out-of-box thinkers and the future

188
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,300
so we are empowered to be curious we're

189
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,419
empowered to learn all the things and to

190
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,580
discover something incredible

191
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,259
so in this talk I'm going to talk

192
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,539
briefly about cyber threats what's going

193
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:18,240
on with them and then how to prioritize

194
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,160
them maybe a little bit about the real

195
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,639
world and then finally the conclusion

196
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,979
so we're gonna go on Adventure on an

197
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,599
adventure and we're going to share I'm

198
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,400
going to share some of my

199
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,440
favorite threats and I hope you like

200
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,539
them too basically we're going to start

201
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,580
with some history go into some

202
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,919
definitions and then some flavors of

203
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,080
cyber threats

204
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,919
so this is the totally official super

205
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,300
serious history of cyber threats

206
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,540
so imagine with me in a galaxy in a

207
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,620
galaxy far far far away someone invented

208
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,080
computers probably some people maybe

209
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,560
some aliens to ensure the future of

210
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,019
humanity through technology and this

211
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,019
laid the groundwork for the birth of

212
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,480
cyber threats

213
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,580
so no talk about the history of cyber

214
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,279
threats would be complete without a

215
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,019
shout out to the very first computer

216
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,440
virus so I will give you a hint it was

217
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
named after the bank robbing Green Ghoul

218
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,200
in Scooby-Doo Where Are You which was a

219
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,200
cartoon in the 1970s

220
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,220
all right it was the creeper so in 1970

221
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,399
Bob Thomas he's like you know I would

222
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,740
love to do a security test and see if

223
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,380
it's possible to make a self-replicating

224
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,680
program and basically if the creeper

225
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,779
visited you it would print out I'm the

226
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,899
creeper catch me if you can so that was

227
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,959
a fun little tidbit of History

228
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,300
so when you're exploring new topics or

229
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,500
looking at things or having

230
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,899
conversations with people I generally

231
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,180
recommend to kind of get on the same

232
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,760
page and level set and the way that I do

233
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,620
that is through understanding other

234
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,959
people's definitions of whatever words

235
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,839
they're using so for instance this one

236
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,420
on the screen here I honestly picked

237
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,880
this one a because I liked it and B

238
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,160
because it kind of aligns with the usage

239
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,860
in this particular talk no other special

240
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,540
reason

241
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,480
so before the Pearl clutching begins

242
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,839
this is not an exhaustive list of cyber

243
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,120
threats it's just some of them and for

244
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,680
people that are interested in looking

245
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,779
into like High Level Threats for your

246
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,420
particular industry check out Verizon's

247
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,180
dbir or data breach investigations

248
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,880
report uh what I love to do in the

249
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,459
evening sometimes is like you know get

250
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,980
some water coffee or whatever drinking

251
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,800
at the time and read the footnotes the

252
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,920
footnotes are absolute perfection and I

253
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,500
highly recommend

254
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,240
so first we're going to start with

255
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,760
information operations so believe it or

256
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,600
not

257
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,959
deep fakes aren't just for Tom Cruise on

258
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,899
tick tock they can also be used to

259
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,860
convince for instance your CEO to go on

260
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,959
record saying stuff that they normally

261
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,680
probably wouldn't say a group that is

262
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,019
well known for doing this is bovan and

263
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,279
Lexus or ta-499 by proofpoint and so

264
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,800
basically they target politicians and

265
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,540
celebrities and they use quote unquote

266
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,959
deep fake pranks wink wink and their

267
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,360
pro-russia Comedians and there's been

268
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,339
rumors that they're Associated or

269
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,260
Affiliated or something with the Russian

270
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,740
government but basically they deny deny

271
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,860
deny if you're interested in exploring

272
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,760
more about information operations I

273
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,399
would suggest checking out cyber War con

274
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,740
and they just released the 2022 videos

275
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,800
or starting to last night and in it

276
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,019
there's some really great info Ops for

277
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,899
State Nexus actors and when I say State

278
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,660
Nexus it's really just a fancy word for

279
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,000
like Affiliated related whatever to like

280
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,480
the government

281
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,899
next we'll talk about system intrusion

282
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,060
and so I'm going to bring up targets

283
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,240
2013 breach as a result of the HVAC

284
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,560
company but I'm not going to talk about

285
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,380
what you think I'm going to talk about

286
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,120
instead I'm going to focus on their glow

287
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,019
up and say there is life after breach

288
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,140
so fast forward about five years give or

289
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,220
take in 2018 2019 Target security team

290
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,459
is absolutely rocking it so they're in

291
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,500
the FSI Sac or the financial services

292
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,380
information

293
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,760
sharing and Analysis Center they're in

294
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,040
the retail ISAC and they're also

295
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,040
contributing to the community and in the

296
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,860
event you don't have an ISAC membership

297
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,100
I highly recommend checking out their

298
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,000
Sans threat hunting or CTI Summit and at

299
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,860
the end of this talk I ended up putting

300
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,740
a lot of these resources on a GitHub so

301
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,139
be sure to look up my GitHub you can

302
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,279
also go to I don't know github.com

303
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,779
Cheerio and then you'll see B-side San

304
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,600
Francisco 23 so all these links are

305
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,440
there

306
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,839
but basically what the target security

307
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,740
company did is they went from breach to

308
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,560
internationally respected security team

309
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,260
in less than five years and I really

310
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,940
don't and this is of course my opinion

311
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,519
so I have to caveat that but

312
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,200
um I really don't think that they get

313
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,660
enough credit for all the work that they

314
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,720
put in uh to overcome that breach

315
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,639
situation

316
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,740
so next we're going to talk about fraud

317
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,700
and one of my favorite fraud actors was

318
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,660
Hush Puppy and he was a Nigerian

319
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,600
influencer so in 2022 he got sentenced

320
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,019
to a little over 11 years in federal

321
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,320
prison for conspiring to launder

322
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,500
tens of millions of dollars due to

323
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,540
online scams

324
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,540
so if you get a chance on Google photos

325
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,540
if you uh just type in Hush Puppy you'll

326
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,240
see Instagram photos he absolutely loved

327
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,519
flaunting his wealth and his love for

328
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,700
luxury I personally saw it as a really

329
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,279
easy collection vehicle for the FBI but

330
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,339
what do I know but check it out it's

331
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:29,519
it's very it's very um out there

332
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,620
so next we're going to talk about supply

333
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,839
chain and this one's a fun one I think

334
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,880
everyone in this audience might be aware

335
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,079
of the supply chain Chain Reaction or

336
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,300
where one supply chain compromised

337
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,720
enabled another supply chain compromise

338
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,820
and I'll of course share it's the 3cx

339
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,500
one with the soft phone application

340
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,019
everyone thought you know crowdstrike

341
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,360
released a Reddit notice on what was it

342
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,199
March 29th of this year and then they're

343
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,180
like oh my gosh 3cx smartphone

344
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,160
application you know look at what's

345
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,639
going on supply chain and then on uh

346
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,459
April 20th uh just a couple days ago

347
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,519
mandan's like hold up we found patient

348
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,680
zero and it happens to be an application

349
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,740
by trading Technologies SO trading

350
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,440
Technologies breach or whatever issue

351
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,540
with that with the back door and then we

352
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,440
have 3cx so just a little tidbit they

353
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,899
think it was attributed to dprk or North

354
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,540
Korea either SP knowledge activity

355
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,160
cluster or group but depending upon

356
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,300
which vendor is your flavor of choice

357
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,339
and finally I just want to bring up a

358
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,600
really important one that gets

359
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,519
overlooked a little bit and it's romance

360
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,660
scams in 2021 at the FBI I said that

361
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,639
there were over a billion dollars in

362
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,680
losses to me that's a lot of money

363
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,699
so we're gonna talk a little bit about

364
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:55,680
celebrity vulnerabilities

365
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,000
so on May 30th of 2022 Microsoft

366
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,100
released cve 2022

367
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,279
30190 and the fun part was that there

368
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:11,279
was no patch available until June 14th

369
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,079
of 2022.

370
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:16,740
so this one won the name Felina this is

371
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,360
why it was a celebrity vulnerability

372
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,600
because it got a special treatment

373
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,820
and essentially it's exploiting Windows

374
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,060
support diagnostic tool via MS Office

375
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,620
files

376
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,740
so fast forward approximately a week or

377
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,940
June 7th of 2022 proof Point released

378
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,980
research saying well well well hold up

379
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,220
folks like ta 579 who's an actor

380
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,320
Associated or a threat activity cluster

381
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,440
group associated with qbot where they

382
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,620
ended up weaponizing a mail doc to abuse

383
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,899
the Felina vulnerability that when

384
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,120
infecting a victim it would end up you

385
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,579
know with a cubot infection so the

386
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,380
important thing here is just to point

387
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,380
out how quickly the threat actors and

388
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,300
and people out there that want to do us

389
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,859
harm essentially are quick to

390
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,319
operationalize and weaponize

391
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,000
vulnerabilities

392
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,520
so a really great talk on Celebrity

393
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,299
vulnerabilities is by Andrew Morris he's

394
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:18,059
the founder of gray nice so in 2022 he

395
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:20,819
did a talk at black hat where basically

396
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,160
he said he has this beautiful graph of

397
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,900
like how the celebrity vulnerabilities

398
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,579
have been increasing like crazy

399
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,400
if you guys like malware and if you also

400
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,100
like cubot there's a really really great

401
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,400
uh talk and a slide deck actually that

402
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,640
goes through cubot's code evolution by

403
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,220
Carlos and Markel they work for they

404
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,500
worked for threat Ray and it was in 2022

405
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,340
bot conference and it's on the GitHub

406
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,440
all right so there's a couple different

407
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,419
types of threat actors I'm not going to

408
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,340
go into all of them on the planet just

409
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,020
some high level ones if you can see on

410
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,100
the slides

411
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,840
so first we're going to start with

412
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,179
e-crime and they're honestly some of my

413
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,960
favorite and there's unfortunately so

414
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,000
many that I can't really pick a favorite

415
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,260
instead what I'm going to do is focus on

416
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,919
their behavioral changes and the e-crime

417
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,500
ecosystem essentially so I personally

418
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,559
really love initial access Brokers and

419
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,559
access as a service

420
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,500
so the e-crime ecosystem is really

421
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,539
interesting it seems like it supports

422
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,360
specialization and honestly I predict a

423
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,059
continued growth in the initial access

424
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,640
brokers in the near future and who knows

425
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,679
forever probably

426
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,720
um and for people that aren't familiar

427
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,200
with what initial access Brokers are

428
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,120
essentially they're groups that are

429
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,280
involved with initial access via first

430
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,000
stage malware payloads and they may or

431
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,059
may not it kind of depends uh work with

432
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,740
ransomware gangs

433
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,200
and just as an aside for people that

434
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,080
love e-crime as much as I do there's a

435
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,760
conference it's actually in May it's

436
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,620
called sleuthcon I'm wearing their

437
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,360
little pin

438
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,460
um you know not not sponsored unless you

439
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,440
count the pin sponsored but it's a

440
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,380
really awesome conference where leading

441
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,299
professionals within the industry share

442
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,059
all the things about e-crime so I

443
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,620
definitely would recommend checking it

444
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,940
out

445
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,840
okay so another group or another type of

446
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,140
threat actors to consider is espionage

447
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,799
so some of my absolute favorite actors

448
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,020
are from China and I'm going to share

449
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,539
with you my absolutely favorite story

450
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:44,039
and it was by proof point so in 2022

451
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,980
proofpoint released a China Espionage

452
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,160
operation research and it was against

453
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,220
the Australian government and the wind

454
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,059
turbine Fleet in the South China Sea so

455
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,160
China actually responded and they're

456
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,080
like no no that's that's disinformation

457
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,059
you know proof points just acting like

458
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,539
the white gloves of the US government

459
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:12,299
you know hashtag ignore uh proofpoint

460
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:15,419
has absolutely quote unquote No

461
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:18,840
professionalism or credibility and let

462
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,059
me tell you the researchers that were

463
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,059
involved with that it was probably my

464
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,799
absolute like one of my absolute

465
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,299
favorite moments in like the back

466
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,100
channels and the twitters and all of

467
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,400
that of like for me if China publicly

468
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,520
criticized my research I would be like

469
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,360
boom I made it like I would add it to my

470
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,240
resume I would be bragging about it I'd

471
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,240
be like guess what you know China thinks

472
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,880
I'm unprofessional

473
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,080
um so

474
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,740
and it was uh Michael Michael Raji so he

475
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,660
actually had his talk from cyber War con

476
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,240
where he goes into very intricate

477
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,760
details released the other day so I

478
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,320
would highly recommend checking it out

479
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,140
it's an absolute Delight

480
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,400
um so yeah

481
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,900
favorite story

482
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,620
the next one are Insider threats so I

483
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,900
had to of course drop this mention of

484
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,500
the 2020 Tesla employee bar incident

485
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,900
where basically they were approached to

486
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,900
help a ransomware gang uh somehow

487
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,000
magically gets software on the network

488
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,940
for a huge payout so that's that's also

489
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,820
that's a fun Story another one is dating

490
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,240
apps and how investigative journalists

491
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,100
are using dating apps and getting

492
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,559
getting industry professionals like me

493
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,320
or yourselves to go out on dates and

494
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,080
then get recorded and you know ask

495
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,880
questions about the company that may or

496
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,400
may not be true uh so that's a fun one

497
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,500
and then the other one that I do have to

498
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,159
bring up that's also fairly recent is

499
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,220
the admin of the thug Shaker Central

500
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,559
Discord server that ended up sharing

501
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,539
confidential information

502
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,700
so what I predict in this particular

503
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,960
Arena

504
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,419
is basically there will be continued use

505
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:09,900
of inventive ways to exploit normal

506
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,080
human interactions so that's like dating

507
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,780
online gaming and all those chats you

508
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,480
know that go on and also too I'm going

509
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,480
to add this in spycraft but spycraft

510
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,179
that happens to leave cyber breadcrumbs

511
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,760
and I'll leave that up to you to

512
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,039
I'll let you connect the dots so the

513
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,860
next one is hacktivis so one of my

514
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,140
favorite examples of hacktivis are the

515
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,960
Russia Ukraine conflict not that Russia

516
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,820
Ukraine conflict is awesome because I

517
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,640
think it's very sad but uh when that

518
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,440
came out you had hacktivists supporting

519
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,120
the Russians and then you had

520
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,940
hacktivists supporting Ukraine and a

521
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,919
really great way to stay on top of all

522
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,220
of that is the Cyber no blog and on

523
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,380
Twitter they have the handle cybernow

524
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,419
20. so definitely check that out

525
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,360
the next one is Terrorism and it's not

526
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,760
going to be the terrorism that you think

527
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,700
I am actually going to speak to domestic

528
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,580
terrorism and extremists in the United

529
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,000
States so I feel that they're gonna

530
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,460
Target potentially critical

531
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,100
infrastructure to basically further

532
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,620
their objectives and I predict that they

533
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,380
will continue recruiting Insider threats

534
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,260
and possibly do a little hecking

535
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,140
but I have to caveat this that I am by

536
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,140
no means an expert in this realm I am a

537
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,059
bystander it's just stuff that I'm

538
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,559
observing and all the stuff that I'm

539
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,539
reading and the back channels and all of

540
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:40,679
that

541
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,500
um so here's the other problem too I

542
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,780
really am not a fan of hate speech it

543
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:49,140
makes me very sad so like I tend to stay

544
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,659
out of these Realms that uh would kind

545
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,760
of give me a little bit more insight so

546
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,580
like I said spectator but basically I

547
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,860
view it as kind of a growing threat and

548
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,200
something that I I personally can't

549
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,880
continue to hashtag ignore

550
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,100
and finally for the lulls so these type

551
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,200
of threat actors I think of the ones

552
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,140
where the road sign has changed or

553
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,179
there's a billboard electronic billboard

554
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,419
that's changed or I don't know like a

555
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:20,880
website defacement so that's what I kind

556
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,880
of think of uh when it comes to that

557
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,539
and finally for people that have red or

558
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,780
purple team operations I also recommend

559
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,360
kind of viewing them and tracking their

560
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,280
particular ttps as a threat actor

561
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,419
so why are cyber threats and basically

562
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,100
there's a lot of different reasons

563
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,020
they're there to disrupt think of

564
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,179
ransomware they're there to destroy

565
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,039
think of all the wipers that came out

566
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,860
during the during the Ukraine Russia

567
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,960
conflict they're there for the lulls

568
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,419
ideologies like all of the hacktivists

569
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,179
and and terrorism and all that other

570
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,100
stuff and for profit and then finally

571
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,640
Espionage and Industrial Espionage so

572
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,980
yeah

573
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,600
so how many

574
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,280
how many new Cyber threats would you

575
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,460
think come out every year

576
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,440
um you know there's there's what Patch

577
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,419
Tuesday a lot of crazy stuff going on

578
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,480
well I'm gonna tell you that there are a

579
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,320
lot and mandian ended up putting out a

580
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,240
report I think it is a couple days ago

581
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,340
and it's their Mandy and M Trends report

582
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,960
where in 2022 they're like uh well we've

583
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,860
been tracking 588 new malware families

584
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,520
like mind blown that's that's a lot I

585
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,039
can't even like fathom that the other

586
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,380
one is

587
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,840
913 threat activity groups that mandya

588
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,880
knew new thread activity groups that

589
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,880
mandya was tracking in 2022 and then

590
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,120
finally for the whole year of 2022 they

591
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,559
were tracking over 35 100 threat groups

592
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,480
and that's a lot that's more than I can

593
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,460
personally keep up with so

594
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,900
yeah

595
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,020
so when you see all of these different

596
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,960
threats whether it's cves or Insider

597
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,840
threats or all of these threat actor

598
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,980
aliases and names like apt-29

599
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,940
Microsoft changed their naming

600
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,640
conventions but they were nobellium and

601
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,980
now they're midnight Blizzard or crowd

602
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,340
strikes Cozy Bear and all the different

603
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,919
malware names like cubot is quack bot is

604
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,840
this and soccer goalers just fake

605
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,539
updates like ah all these names but at

606
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,100
the end of the day they're all just

607
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,380
cyber threats and I kind of feel like

608
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,480
the Ancient Aliens Guy where I'm like

609
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,260
cyber threats

610
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,159
so how did we get here how did we get

611
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,919
here and I'm going to share that I feel

612
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,880
that evil I.E cyber threats aren't

613
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,880
inevitable but instead the expanding

614
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,460
Universe of cyber threats are actually

615
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,179
compliments of human creativity

616
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:09,000
Innovation and the power of perception

617
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,159
so if you've been around the block a

618
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,320
couple times like I have

619
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,720
uh I think you start to realize that

620
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,179
there's like a positive and negative to

621
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:21,000
everything give or take and that not

622
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,880
everything is as it seems so I'll give

623
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,299
you some examples number one splitting

624
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:31,260
the Uranian app uranium atom

625
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,840
on the one hand we have a nuclear power

626
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,320
plant and on the other hand we have an

627
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,919
atomic bomb another example is freedom

628
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,419
versus sovereignty

629
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,820
so we have the United States and then we

630
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,220
have the Russia Ukraine conflict and

631
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,720
then we also have the China Taiwan

632
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,140
tensions that are going on which also

633
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,240
impact the Cyber threat landscape and

634
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,400
then finally software is another example

635
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,419
so Excel I love me some Excel as a CTI

636
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:04,260
analyst love it but so do threat actors

637
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,840
and they love malicious macros just as

638
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,340
much as I love pivot tables

639
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,700
all right so now we're going to get into

640
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,539
different perspectives and shared is the

641
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,659
absolute goat like I adore her I love

642
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:27,360
her I want to be her when I grow up like

643
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,539
she's super cool so when you're thinking

644
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:33,900
about being a cyber Defender like you're

645
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,059
doing good for your employer and

646
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,460
possibly other companies you know on and

647
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,640
on you're like the hero right but when

648
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,620
you think about the threat activity

649
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,419
groups and threat actors you're actually

650
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,940
the villain in their story because

651
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,740
you're burning their infrastructure

652
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,020
you're giving you know the world a heads

653
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,480
up like hey China's up to no good in the

654
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,120
South China Sea right like they're like

655
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,520
oh no like that's not happening you know

656
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,760
they're not happy I mean if my soul if

657
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,860
my joy in the morning essentially is

658
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,320
getting up and like hmm what can I do

659
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,880
today how can I make their lives

660
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,580
absolutely miserable I am definitely

661
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,740
their super evil villain basically

662
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,860
so I'm gonna do a really quick story and

663
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,679
this has to do with the December 17th of

664
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,919
2019 Citrix released a workaround for

665
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,700
cve 2019

666
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,620
19781 and basically there was no patch

667
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,080
available for a little over a month

668
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,559
uh basically exploitation resulted in an

669
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,399
unauthenticated remote code execution

670
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:43,919
and I can tell you right before a long

671
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,740
holiday weekend those are the absolute

672
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,039
worst four words you can hear on the

673
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:50,940
planet

674
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,000
so companies had to make a decision they

675
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,580
had to either recall people from a

676
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,799
holiday deal with all the political

677
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,899
issues related to change freezes

678
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,460
depending upon what company you're

679
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,760
working for and you know get people to

680
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,980
apply the work around or not

681
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,980
so fast forward approximately 30 days

682
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,399
and mandian ended up releasing a report

683
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,140
regarding apt-41 and they were doing

684
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:21,059
probably the largest and broadest

685
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,960
campaign that apt-41 has ever done of

686
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,840
like exploiting all the things

687
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,600
so apt 41 in case you don't know there

688
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,640
are Chinese Espionage group but

689
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,799
basically if you had a cyber threat

690
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,179
intelligence analyst or security

691
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,940
professional they were able to give the

692
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,460
company a heads up and be like yo this

693
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,679
looks about we should probably do

694
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,720
something about it

695
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,299
um and basically you become the villain

696
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:51,720
in apt-41 story because you block them

697
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,840
from from Fun and Profit

698
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,480
so now we're gonna get into

699
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,100
basically how to prioritize the Cyber

700
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,820
threats as the universe is expanding so

701
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,640
are the Cyber threats so how do we

702
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,240
decide what to focus on

703
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,760
cyber threat cyber threat intelligence

704
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,480
to me is a lot like discovering threats

705
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,760
exploration and almost a hundred percent

706
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,539
of the time I feel it's kind of leaning

707
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:27,240
into your curiosity and seeking

708
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,100
something incredible and if you're lucky

709
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,279
wink wink it results in really

710
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,159
interesting findings

711
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,559
so these are some things that I like to

712
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,659
think about when I'm in the process of

713
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:42,659
creating an RFI or responding to an RFI

714
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,580
for one of my stakeholders and

715
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,740
actionable is a really big word here

716
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,059
because it's super important

717
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,620
one of my favorite stakeholders are of

718
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,779
course sock all of them are but sock

719
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,760
vulnerability management and threat

720
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,600
hunting an example of um one of the rfis

721
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,299
from vulnerability management is

722
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:06,000
basically they're like hey

723
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,360
CTI we have so many phones I need your

724
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,059
help to prioritize what to patch

725
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:13,799
so how we do that

726
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,860
we look for proof of concept code uh you

727
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,720
know targeting any cves that are related

728
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,760
relevant to our organization we look for

729
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,520
exploitation in the wild and uh

730
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,559
basically that helps prioritize patching

731
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,100
all right the other thing that we use

732
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,380
when we get an RFI or are doing our

733
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,360
cyber threat intelligence work is the

734
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,940
Cyber threat intelligence life cycle and

735
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,620
this just gives you an idea sometimes

736
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,299
the rfis that we get they're pretty

737
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,179
Broad and we need this because

738
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,940
essentially sometimes cyber threat

739
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,980
intelligence can kind of be like Choose

740
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,059
Your Own Adventure

741
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,600
finally a cyber threat prioritization so

742
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,520
I personally really love to use the

743
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,799
internal attack data I love to look at

744
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:03,059
the malware that's hitting the

745
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,740
organization and different types of

746
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,440
threats and I use that to start building

747
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,480
the threat landscape with a bunch of the

748
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,059
other stuff up here including incidents

749
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,700
and known targeting sometimes thread

750
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,279
actors will be like Tahiti we want to

751
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,760
pone your company insert your company's

752
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,399
name so of course they get slapped onto

753
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:26,100
a threat landscape and then of course

754
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,080
third party compromise

755
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,260
foreign

756
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:33,419
telligent sharing is also vitally

757
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,519
important in cyber threat intelligence

758
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,279
if you get a chance I highly recommend

759
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:41,220
joining the isacs or information sharing

760
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,140
analysis centers that's where

761
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,260
professionals from

762
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,820
particularly your industry but there's a

763
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,919
lot of different industry eye sacs they

764
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,559
get together and they share Intel and

765
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,120
they share what's up with the threat

766
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,539
actors and iocs and all the things so

767
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,580
some of the other really great examples

768
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,919
is solarwinds I'm sure everyone in this

769
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,659
audience is familiar with solarwinds

770
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:06,480
where mandiant gave people a yo heads up

771
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,060
like you know Russia's up to no good and

772
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,320
we of course have the 3cx and trading

773
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,520
Technologies a supply chain chain

774
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,219
reaction that was recent uh really

775
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:21,060
another great example is log4j where all

776
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,879
of the Security Professionals a across

777
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:26,159
the world essentially got together to

778
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,379
support one another through figuring out

779
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,679
what the H log 4J is and how to defend

780
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,320
against potential exploitation and then

781
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,359
finally I have to do a shout out to

782
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:39,060
wannacry with malware Tech or Marcus

783
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,219
sharing the quick kill switch with

784
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,459
everyone

785
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,139
so I'm going to talk a little bit about

786
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:49,199
structured analytic techniques and it

787
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,639
was started in the intelligence

788
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,679
community and there's an actual whole

789
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,219
book with that name essentially and so

790
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,400
for intelligence analysis uh analysts

791
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,920
the structured analytic techniques help

792
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,619
with actually performing the analysis

793
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,960
because essentially our working memory

794
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,420
is give or take seven plus or minus two

795
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,680
items

796
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,560
so a really good example of structured

797
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,200
analytic techniques is the analysis of

798
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,320
competing hypotheses and digital Shadows

799
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,619
now known as relia Quest they put out a

800
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,320
really great ACH or analysis Computing a

801
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,680
competing hypotheses blog on wannacry

802
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,820
the other types of uh SATs or structured

803
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,579
analytic techniques are lists

804
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:37,020
brainstorming and also challenging

805
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,599
mindsets so that would be like Devil's

806
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,079
advocacy red teaming and I'm gonna add

807
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,119
something else so this might not

808
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,220
necessarily be structured analytic

809
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,320
techniques but

810
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,320
I challenge you to weaponize your mind

811
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,680
by being strategic with the talks that

812
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,079
you pick this weekend at B-side San

813
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,540
Francisco basically you can go to things

814
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,579
outside your wheelhouse and gain

815
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,540
different perspectives

816
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:07,380
so now we're going to talk about the

817
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,420
real world

818
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,160
but first

819
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,740
I want to bring up an important topic

820
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,380
and that is burnout

821
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,960
so one of the helpful strategies that I

822
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,540
employ in my day-to-day is really

823
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,780
focusing on things that spark joy and

824
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,839
are fun honestly for me every day so

825
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,060
some of my favorite things are super

826
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:34,020
cute little animals also memes memetic

827
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,240
Warfare

828
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,660
and you guessed it cyber threats so I

829
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,359
love all the memes I love talking with

830
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,760
stakeholders and getting into the

831
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,800
nitty-gritty of like what they want and

832
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,800
how I can help them so humor for me

833
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,680
helps fight burnout so you can find your

834
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,079
own thing

835
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,079
so Frameworks are also very important in

836
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,940
cyber threat intelligence and a good

837
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,240
example of one is miter attack so miter

838
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,980
attack for people that might not be

839
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,020
familiar with it is basically a

840
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,980
knowledge base of adversary tactics and

841
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,079
techniques based on real-world

842
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:16,140
observations and it kind of gives you a

843
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,400
common language for Security

844
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,280
Professionals to chat and commingle and

845
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,880
kind of be on the same page so tactics

846
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,760
generally refer to the why of an attack

847
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,520
technique and techniques refer to the

848
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,980
how of an attack technique and then

849
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,920
procedures give you very detailed uh

850
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,619
rundown of of what's going on with that

851
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,380
couple different ways to explore

852
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,300
procedural level information I'll just

853
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,119
shout out one is a red team blog so we

854
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,160
have John Hammond in the in the audience

855
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,320
here I love like all the red team

856
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,260
everything I learned so much from them

857
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,119
even though I'm not a red teamer myself

858
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,020
like I absolutely adore them so you can

859
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,359
learn a ton from them blue tumors

860
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:03,839
just saying okay so here I'm gonna run

861
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,780
down an example of let's say you have an

862
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,900
email a malicious email but you can't

863
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,480
get the sample for whatever reason

864
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,119
so kind of how the attack path works

865
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,460
with this is you have an HTML attachment

866
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,520
that drops a password protected zipped

867
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,839
ISO that contains an lnk file that uses

868
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,420
CMD to start cubot

869
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,700
so what do you do you don't have the

870
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,700
sample off to virus total and if you

871
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,460
have vti you're super lucky and you can

872
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,400
grab the sample otherwise off to off to

873
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,000
the twitters so basically you obtain the

874
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,579
compressed parent ISO and you extract it

875
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,500
this is just you know me extracting it

876
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,339
and then you run strings on the contents

877
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,740
the really super special Uber strings

878
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,200
right then you compare the old sample

879
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,760
that you have that was in the

880
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,619
environment to the new one that was

881
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:01,260
available in the wild and then you can

882
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,359
see your detections and see if you need

883
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,720
to build more robust detections more

884
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,700
resilient detections based on whatever

885
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,820
changes they made so this is one way

886
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,359
that you can improve the security

887
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,420
posture at your organization through

888
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,720
cyber threat intelligence

889
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,700
so now we're going to close out this

890
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,200
talk

891
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,380
so I talked about a lot of different

892
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,560
cyber threats and basically threat

893
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,880
actors are going to use what works and

894
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,880
guess what they're gonna continue using

895
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,040
what works and then we make that not

896
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,079
work and then they find something else

897
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,820
that'll work and then it's a

898
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,000
never-ending cycle of getting good at

899
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,119
what works currently and I know that

900
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,119
this sounds really super basic but I

901
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:57,119
feel it's an opportunity for us to get

902
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,060
really good at whatever is working in

903
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,359
the current moment to you know use the

904
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,579
band hammer for any type of thread

905
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,099
actors to get into your network or do

906
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:09,480
things that you don't want them to do

907
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,700
essentially

908
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,300
so looking back at past five-ish years

909
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,599
of my cyber threat of my cyber threat

910
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,520
career and the observations that I made

911
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,240
of CTI wins I smile

912
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,180
I smile because of the hard-working

913
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,240
professionals that discovered many

914
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,640
incredible some things and followed

915
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,220
their curiosity to help protect their

916
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,700
organization and other organizations and

917
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,160
while I may never get dragged or get

918
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,820
super shade from China publicly

919
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,460
um I'd like to think that at least I

920
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,040
make the cyber world a little bit of a

921
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,200
safer place

922
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,400
so I hope this talk inspired you to

923
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,619
either engage your internal cyber threat

924
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,960
intelligence team maybe on board a

925
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,560
function and to discover your something

926
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,680
incredible this weekend at B-side San

927
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,300
Francisco

928
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,420
so thank you for spending time with me

929
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,700
today and I'll leave you with this

930
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,020
question

931
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,440
how are you going to expand your

932
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,020
understanding of the Cyber threat

933
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,720
Universe this weekend thank you very

934
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,579
much and end scene I'll take questions

935
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:33,000
I have a a minute and 30 seconds for

936
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,500
questions if anyone has any

937
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,260
if not I'll be out in the hallway as

938
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,079
well I thank everyone for your time

939
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:47,000
and I hope you have a great conference
