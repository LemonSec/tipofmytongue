um but please let's welcome Aaron Berry

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,920
who is the head of talent for code red

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,379
Partners a person to know she will help

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,740

[Applause]

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,500
okay hi can you hear me okay okay

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,539
um so my name is Aaron Berry head of

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,580
talent for code red partners and I'm

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,740
going to be talking to you a bit today

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,279
about security hiring trends

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,960
um I've been recruiting just cyber

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,300
security for about four years in my

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,700
career before that I was recruiting Tech

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,640
I've been recruiting about eight years

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,660
um

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,879
so I feel like I know a bit about

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,219
security recruiting at this point but

19
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,379
I'm very thankful to have you guys let

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,940
me speak to you all

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,840
um

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,300
and I'll kind of kick things off with

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,780
some uplifting statistics I know over

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,239
the past six months it's probably just

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,520
Doom and Gloom every time you jump on

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,040
any website

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
um oh it's things are expecting to get

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,920
better uh you know a spirit of Labor

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,960
Statistics 35 growth year over year 2023

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,720
to 2031

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,720
so that feels really nice but what

32
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,659
exactly does that mean

33
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,400
um one more little statistic I'm sure

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,140
you guys see these all the time they're

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,799
a little fluffy right 300 3.5 million

36
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,780
open security jobs by 2031 but what kind

37
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,780
of jobs what exactly does that mean and

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,400
that's really what I'll be concentrating

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,299
on

40
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,340
um

41
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,880
so this is a bit of a spicy take I do

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,500
admit

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,619
um I am humble brag I have helped build

44
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,320
a couple of these teams you see up here

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,399
um so I know how difficult their bars

46
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,860
are and exactly what that Tech looks

47
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,180
like

48
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,820
um so Fang I'm sure a lot of you hear

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,660
that a lot mang meta sure but it stands

50
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,080
for Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix and

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,640
Google

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,000
um over the past couple of years when I

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,060
started out everybody wanted at least

54
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,520
somebody who's worked at one of these

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,560
companies

56
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,220
as things have flipped a bit

57
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,340
um we're seeing things change

58
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,980
um so one thing I say is take a look at

59
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,319
the tech being used around you to

60
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,900
overcome day-to-day problems so if you

61
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,819
pull out your phone and look at the apps

62
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,040
on your phone looking at the apps on

63
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,680
your peers phones your family's phones

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,440
um that's a good indicator of this is

65
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,200
somewhere that I would like to work this

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,260
is something that people are utilizing

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,860
um

68
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,720
of course everyone uses Apple Amazon

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,080
meta but there's about a hundred

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,780
companies I'd say that have just as good

71
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,280
engineers and just as hard tech bars

72
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,220
also too we're in the age of innovation

73
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,580
so the Big Talk lately has been AI last

74
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,879
year it was a cryptocurrency machine

75
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,860
learning autonomous vehicles drones

76
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,840
metaverse

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,080
Oculus there's a lot going on and a lot

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,900
has come out in the past year or so

79
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,540
uh companies and hiring managers are

80
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,420
increasingly looking for Builders

81
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,420
so uh what is the Builder right

82
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,799
it's somebody that can stay Hands-On in

83
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,700
the weeds even if you're a manager

84
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,440
Architects Tech lead

85
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,140
um if something needs to be built if

86
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,760
there's an issue

87
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,099
can you jump in the weeds with an

88
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,360
engineer too

89
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,560
and remediate it can you fix it or are

90
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,000
you somebody that's just been like

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,140
sitting in silos if a problem happens

92
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,620
you can't do it anything so stay

93
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,019
Hands-On stay in the know

94
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,180
say as build or heavy as you can

95
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,100
okay a heart piggybacking back on that

96
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,620
I'm sure if you listen to Sasha

97
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,320
yesterday had a security for grammarly

98
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,600
he said I don't want people that can't

99
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,680
code

100
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,360
now I hear a lot from security hiring

101
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,580
managers that they want people who can

102
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,979
code and build and I usually will follow

103
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,580
up with is this production level code or

104
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,000
taping together some systems scripting

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,520
um of course they'll say oh it doesn't

106
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,139
have to be production production level

107
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,620
code but you at least need to have the

108
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,620
ability to complete projects with a few

109
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,040
more Engineers is what I always say

110
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,699
um

111
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,900
also too embedded Hardware security

112
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,740
architecting and building secure

113
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,199
products within Hardware is in high

114
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,520
demand

115
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,960
so

116
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,600
um I will say some of the hardest roles

117
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,520
I've ever worked on in my career have

118
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,860
been embedded Hardware plus software

119
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,860
that is the elusive unicorn I would say

120
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,860
uh but if you are working for a company

121
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,320
and you have the ability to touch

122
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,660
different types of products whether it's

123
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,780
applications infrastructure of physical

124
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,240
product

125
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,479
um software Cloud touch as many pieces

126
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,699
as you can

127
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:45,539
um

128
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,660
and then also too a big uptake in

129
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,759
software engineering so back to everyone

130
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,220
wants a builder right

131
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,960
um so how are these people that are

132
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,660
software Engineers or suis Landing their

133
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,300
first security position

134
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,360
so there are a lot of security adjacent

135
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,780
teams that I work with

136
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,720
trust and safety privacy identity access

137
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,660
management has been huge lately even

138
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,479
like threat Intel detections

139
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,539
um and then also to hottest languages

140
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,460
I'm seeing are

141
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,740
python go rust C C plus plus a lot of

142
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,500
scholar coding lately Linux job is a

143
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
little dated but you get it

144
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,840
software engineering's always going to

145
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,699
be lovely you can land on a security

146
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,199
adjacent team

147
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,220
and really maximize

148
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,259
your compensation at the end of the day

149
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,139
because we work to make money to build

150
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,319
great products but a lot of our families

151
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,060
are counting on us to support them and

152
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,020
that's just how it is

153
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,699
Okay so

154
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,100
trending roles

155
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,940
um

156
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,880
Cloud security engineers and product

157
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,300
security Engineers are starting to be

158
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,039
pushed together

159
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,639
um

160
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,160
more and more these two pillars excuse

161
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,800
me I already said that so infrastructure

162
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,539
as code AWS gcp jack of all trades

163
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,639
engineer it's especially if you're a

164
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,380
startup this is what people are looking

165
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,240
for

166
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,520
um threat intelligence huge uptick in

167
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,180
roles and pay as the world is more

168
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,599
remote not threat than ever

169
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,500
um

170
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,360
you all know this if you watch the news

171
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,340
in the past year everyone feels

172
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,620
extremely threatened and everyone is

173
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,919
remote and isolated so that intelligence

174
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,039
is really upticking

175
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,780
um so software engineers and I brought

176
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,360
that up security trust safety teams

177
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,940
the reason is

178
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,720
companies are looking for their

179
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,000
Engineers to build Out Security tooling

180
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and platforms internally it seemed more

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,759
secure and cost-saving option

182
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,800
so when I first started recruiting

183
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,720
security it was very much like oh I can

184
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,479
just buy a product off the shelf

185
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:13,979
implement it and it's done

186
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,000
but these top tech companies and

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,940
companies that are trying to get more

188
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,520
rounds of funding

189
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,979
cost saving maybe not layoff half their

190
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,500
security team

191
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
they're using cost-saving options

192
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,740
they're hiring people that could be a

193
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,559
software engineer or honestly like a

194
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,740
security engineer in their own right

195
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,700
guess what you're going to save money

196
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,200
this person can do two things

197
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,420
okay so competition is fierce

198
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,459
of course there there's a pretty high

199
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,440
number of open jobs and it is getting

200
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,100
better I would say every week month

201
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,519
after month more openings are coming up

202
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,980
but with that there's a lot of

203
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,300
competition

204
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,959
um

205
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,240
I don't know meta just laid off how many

206
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,000
people they're all going to be looking a

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,920
lot of layoffs have happened there are a

208
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,920
lot of people that are really freaking

209
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,260
good out there interviewing that you're

210
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,540
going to be up against

211
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,380
um

212
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,080
something that has really presented

213
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,440
itself is how quickly people are up

214
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,959
leveling and upskilling

215
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,680
so I would say the biggest pushback on

216
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,560
why people uh don't want to interview a

217
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,240
candidate

218
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,779
um is zero progression in their career

219
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,240
there's zero growth they've been a

220
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,920
senior for

221
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,160
years like why are they not a staff why

222
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,380
would I want to talk to them

223
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,279
um

224
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,260
so honestly if you're in a situation

225
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,660
where you cannot up level things are

226
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,080
extremely stagnant you're pigeonholed

227
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,420
it's gonna be time to take a look out

228
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,480
outside of where you are people are

229
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,120
really paying attention to this

230
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,279
um also too candidates with transferable

231
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,420
skills moving into cyber security

232
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,820
a lot of people are coming right out of

233
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,160
school right up out of sweet rolls and

234
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,899
getting on security teams security

235
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,540
adjacent teams

236
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,640
um and then also too I know Zach talked

237
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,920
about uh personal branding stand out

238
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,720
from the crowd

239
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,600
So speaking engagements put them out

240
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,140
there passion projects also count

241
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,680
so something else I've noticed

242
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,940
um that's been trending is

243
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,339
passion projects and projects that you

244
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,579
complete outside of your nine to five or

245
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,740
your work right

246
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,500
um I'd say a year or two to go if you

247
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,140
didn't do that work for a company

248
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,180
managers didn't really want to hear

249
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,560
about it

250
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,579
um nowadays I have people that land

251
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:07,560
positions from a

252
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,399
night project where they built this

253
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,380
product themselves that has nothing to

254
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,640
do with what they're doing because they

255
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,680
hate what they're doing but guess what

256
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,660
they can build this

257
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,480
put it on your resume put it on your

258
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,459
LinkedIn if you are comfortable with

259
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:26,040
some of the work that you are doing

260
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,079
um not specifically for the company

261
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,760
you're working for

262
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,720
please get it out there it's ju much

263
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,579
just as valuable if not the same level

264
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,320
of value

265
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,220
um

266
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,839
and like

267
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,839
people are caring about passion nowadays

268
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,420
like why do you want to work here

269
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,140
um

270
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,399
if it is your passion to be in

271
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,540
that certain industry maybe you're

272
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,279
interviewing for like a cryptocurrency

273
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,220
company if you're passionate about that

274
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,700
like make that absolutely known

275
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,420
um

276
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,640
if you're on the fence

277
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,760
fake the passion I've seen way too many

278
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,279
talented Engineers

279
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,560
um get nose

280
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,740
because yes they can do the job but they

281
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,339
have no no passion for our product

282
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,140
and I'm like they don't know your

283
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,880
product they're freaking interviewing

284
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,600
but research the company get excited

285
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,420
pump yourself up if we're interviewing

um and then remain relevant in the know

289
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,760
uh honestly month after month things

290
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,600
change you have to up skill and

291
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,220
prioritize your your professional

292
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,839
development

293
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,760
um if the company you're working for

294
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,339
doesn't give you

295
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,700
anything to develop you

296
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,700
please find it there are so many tools

297
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,920
like

298
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,540
pre-lengthened pieces

299
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,040
um groups to join discord's plot the

300
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,860
jump on GitHub and see what's trending

301
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,600
see what people are doing

302
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,180
um I'll admit I am one of those GitHub

303
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,940
recruiters uh so I'm always looking

304
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,940
there so if you're talented coder push

305
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,600
that GitHub out if you have created a

306
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,519
website or something with all your

307
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,839
passion projects and you're excited

308
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,959
about that push that out like everything

309
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,440
that you do it matters not just the nine

310
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,420
to five job you're working

311
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,339
every aspect of your life matters

312
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,459
okay and back to why you need to really

313
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:51,240
just be yourself put yourself out there

314
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,760
um I kind of want to close things on a

315
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,100
pretty positive note

316
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,600
um diversity

317
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,940
things are getting better people are

318
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,600
taking more time to build their teams

319
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,480
um and also

320
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,579
diversity a lot of companies will look

321
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:12,240
at it differently whether it's building

322
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,980
diverse teams bringing different

323
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,320
perspectives different experiences to

324
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,760
the table

325
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,760
um I'm very rarely seeing companies now

326
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,560
just higher from one company or maybe oh

327
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,019
I want only Googles only Amazon people

328
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,180
these big orgs

329
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,700
if every security engineer you have on

330
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,399
your team is from these big giant

331
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:36,839
organizations

332
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:37,820
um

333
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,860
that's also not diverse we need people

334
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,079
from all walks of life all backgrounds

335
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,480
all areas of the world it is

336
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,660
so freaking important to

337
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,360
really just build a smart team honestly

338
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,040
whether it's

339
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,540
a culture fits different areas of the

340
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,760
country I'm a big remote Pusher so that

341
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,740
that's big for me

342
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,240
um but it's not only going to make for

343
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,980
stronger Workforce but it also helps to

344
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,899
create a more inclusive and Equitable

345
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,880
industry

346
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,620
um why would you want to go work

347
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,620
somewhere where nobody thinks like you

348
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,760
and like nobody looks like you uh

349
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,519
inclusivity it's important people do

350
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,699
their best work when they're comfortable

351
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:24,660
um

352
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,699
and companies are starting to recognize

353
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:30,120
this so it is a plus

354
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,240
um industry is constantly evolving so is

355
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,339
the Herring landscape

356
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,120
um

357
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,060
so there's much in the note newsletters

358
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,120
I'm big on newsletters for example

359
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,079
um

360
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,240
staying in the know as much as possible

361
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,100
even like

362
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,980
I know we're not stock Brokers but when

363
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,160
it comes to job searching and closing

364
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,760
big deals that stock actually means a

365
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,019
lot

366
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:58,680
um

367
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,019
take a look at the stock market take a

368
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,360

375
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,500

392
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,240
today

393
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,259
awesome thank you Aaron questions

394
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,959
hello

395
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,480
um you mentioned uh coding skills and

396
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,099
infrastructure as code skills do you see

397
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,799
a lot of terraform like appetite or like

398
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,359
looking for like terraform skills or

399
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,679
other like cash Corps tools I do so uh I

400
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,540
wouldn't say the past

401
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,699
two or three Cloud security engineering

402
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,099
positions I worked on were terraform

403
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,900
heavy

404
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,799
um

405
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,140
so a hundred percent uh any Cloud skills

406
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,539
um are good of course the most I see is

407
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,940
AWS gcp

408
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,039
I know I've got a lot of Microsoft Azure

409
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,260
folks LinkedIn that's great too but um

410
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,140
multi-cloud is the uh what everyone

411
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,480
wants ideally or at least two of the

412
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,080
three major clouds uh terraform I feel

413
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,059
like last year maybe the year before it

414
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,640
was everyone won kubernetes uh now

415
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,039
everything's terraform but

416
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,960
honestly the more tools and languages

417
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,120
you touch uh the better

418
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,500
things

419
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,100
hi uh what questions would you recommend

420
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,640
candidates as they ask

421
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,500
employers like

422
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,940
I'm pretty much trying to go through

423
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,679
done a bunch of different lists and it's

424
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,220
hard to remember

425
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,679
by case

426
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,360
um each company is

427
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,640
so different each industry is so

428
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,140
different

429
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,660
um a large company is going to look

430
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,780
different than a small company so

431
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,200
something I always tell my candidates

432
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,880
that I work with is like we are going to

433
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,640
take every role on a case-by-case basis

434
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,940
one position that you're working on and

435
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,919
interviewing for it might be your dream

436
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,500
job and you're gonna

437
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,640
um

438
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,799
probably have different questions for

439
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,320
your dream job and your dream head of

440
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,720
security or CSO to work with

441
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,500
um

442
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,860
than you are if maybe you're just

443
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,000
Dustin uh

444
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,220
dusting yourself off and starting to

445
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,940
interview so take it Case by case

446
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,840
do some research on the company

447
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,820
um companies are always pushing out

448
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,620
blogs

449
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,460
um

450
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,760
honestly just do your research and due

451
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,460
diligence on the company and the role

452
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,860
how you can impact

453
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,679
um and spin it that way because that's

454
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,260
kind of digging into like that passion

455
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,880
piece

456
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,500
um

457
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,120
fake it till you make it if you don't

458
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,919
have passion for the product like at

459
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,360
least figure out what the product is

460
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,539
what the company does

461
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:54,120
spend about at least 30 minutes

462
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,520
whip out a note I'm a big notebook paper

463
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,400
pin person and like write down some key

464
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,100
pieces you noticed about the company

465
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,620
because hiring managers

466
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,419
um when you ask about the company and

467
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:07,620
the product

468
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,840
that's a plus one for them they're like

469
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,600
oh you care about our company you care

470

471
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,419
about this

472
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,520
um it's going to be more significant

473
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,679
than just a

474
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,299
what's your favorite part of working

475
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,280
