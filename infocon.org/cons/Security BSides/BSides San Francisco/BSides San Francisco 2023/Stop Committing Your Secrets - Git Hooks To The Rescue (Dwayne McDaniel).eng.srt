what's that sales perfect thank you for

48
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,540
being here at this talk so I think no

49
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,680
matter what your title is we can all

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,659
agree this is a dumb idea you can have

51
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,340
the best security in the planet you can

52
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,439
build up your defensive walls all day

53
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,200
build moats whatever but if you put a

54
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,360
key to the front door out there people

55
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,100
gonna get in and of course we're not

56
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,380
gonna do that that's dumb right but we

57
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,700
do this

58
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,100
all the time I did this two weeks ago

59
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,000
working on a CLI not even joking uh like

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,979
I just I had to just test the API

61
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,560
endpoint worked and it did and then I

62
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,360
just oh I got to do this real quick oh

63
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,680
and then I got a slack message from a

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,720
boss and then I got this other thing to

65
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,480
work on and by the time I go to commit

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,860
this

67
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,020
I forgot that I put this in here and

68
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,819
then it makes its way out to the world I

69
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,620
work for company called get Guardian uh

70
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,879
didn't mention it earlier we got a booth

71
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,800
over an abstract Village

72
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,099
um the uh resume Village so go over

73
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:27,780
there and talk to us about stuff but we

74
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,940
put this report out every year

75
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,220
um last year we found 10 million Secrets

76
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,640
just hanging out in GitHub public repos

77
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,739
that's just GitHub public we didn't look

78
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:38,879
anywhere else

79
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,860
um or at least not in the report uh this

80
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,000
is a huge increase over the previous

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,360
year and it's growing faster than

82
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,180
the uh growth of GitHub so it's not just

83
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,620
newbies it's not just people coming on

84
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,700
for the first time and not knowing what

85
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,860
they're doing this is affecting very

86
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,280
large companies out there uh we could go

87
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,959
through all these breaches and I'm happy

88
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,459
to talk to you about any of these in

89
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:00,840
depth and we have blog posts about all

90
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,860
of those that's what it links to I'll

91
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,720
share the slides out on Twitter after

92
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,879
this uh

93
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,440
so it's not just new people it's it's

94
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,680
people of all

95
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,659
all ranges

96
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,220
so how do we fix this well there's a

97
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,780
number of approaches but I think the

98
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,060
core approach is to let's start using a

99
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,159
tool we already use in a slightly

100
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,200
different way then you might be already

101
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,280
using it

102
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,400
who here uses git

103
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,379
anybody SVN

104
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,060
get out of here you're not allowed in

105
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,959
here

106
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,879
um I'm kidding everybody's welcome uh

107
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,500
but git is the stupid content tracker

108
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,300
this is what gitster and Linus called it

109
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,280
uh if you take man get that's what you

110
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,959
get up on the screen

111
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,879
um because it's dumb but it's also

112
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,620
really efficient it takes an entire

113
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,900
snapshot of the working directory at any

114
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,940
given time every time you take do a git

115
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,379
ad it's like let's take all those files

116
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,500
and compress them down with zlib uh or

117
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,700
yeah anyway

118
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,319
um you can press them down push them

119
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,480
into an index as a compressed file and

120
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,799
then when you commit that it commits

121
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,980
that through this chain of commits so

122
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,739
your entire history is your entire

123
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,480
history that's the magic of git that you

124
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,459
can go back in time at any point and

125
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,060
check out that particular reality

126
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,340
but that also means that it's always

127
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,040
there so if you add a secret and then

128
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,019
take it back out

129
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,760
and just in the next commit it's still

130
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,620
there because you didn't take it out you

131
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,020
need to actually execute and destroy

132
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,240
that commit and that's just painful and

133
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,500
there's ways to avoid putting it in

134
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,479
there like get ignore

135
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,880
um which is awesome except I'll just I

136
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,080
don't have enough time to play The

137
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,940
Guessing Game but yeah see I

138
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,740
accidentally I accidentally commented

139
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,600
out with EnV file so now I'm committing

140
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,180
my EMV file and now I'm gonna share my

141
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,860
secrets with the world

142
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,900
and there are awesome awesome Solutions

143
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,160
out there everyone should be using

144
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,479
everyone should be using at least

145
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,759
hashicort Vault or Doppler or something

146
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,560
like that or if you're using a platform

147
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,900
for your tooling something like Azure

148
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,080
key Vault or aws's version of it or

149
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,940
gcp's version of it or fill in the

150
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,280
blanks version of it or even on

151
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,639
server EnV files and if we'd all just do

152
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,680
these two things consistently

153
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,180
that would be it I wouldn't have to do

154
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,860
this talk anymore and we could go about

155
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,240
my life and I could do about something

156
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,300
else with my with my brain but in we

157
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,759
keep doing this and it's not that we

158
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,560
tested the secret that's not I'm not

159
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,360
here to shame anyone because again I did

160
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,580
this two weeks ago

161
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,160
this problem is that we then commit and

162
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,740
push that secret out to the world

163
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,320
once it's out there well then it's a

164
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,520
really bad time because when we have to

165
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,259
surgically remove it coordinate with the

166
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,639
rest of the team communicate with

167
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,720
everyone else that could have touched

168
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,060
that repo but if we can catch it before

169
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,460
we even commit it

170
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,780
we don't really have a problem because

171
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,160
we caught it locally that's what

172
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,780
happened to me I caught it locally

173
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,880
because I had a robot

174
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,160
that does this

175
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,340
so how did I get that robot to work well

176
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,520
get gives us away there's this awesome

177
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,500
automation platform that Linus built in

178
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,360
because he wanted a way to execute

179
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,400
scripts when certain things happened

180
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,500
I think of it as a Rube Goldberg

181
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,180
building device because it's any

182
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,860
arbitrary script you want to build

183
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,900
githooks there are 17 along the way if

184
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,280
you take nothing else away from this

185
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,160
entire talk go to get hooks.com

186
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,020
it's beautiful it's a wonderful thank

187
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,419
you very much Matt Hudson for doing your

188
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,419
work uh but there are 17

189
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,580
uh you can hook into so pre-commit

190
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,080
prepare commit message and commit

191
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,419
message all happen before the commit

192
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,759
actually finishes so if you can tell a

193
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,100
script in the middle of that hey

194
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,840
look for a secret

195
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,340
and

196
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,960
stop it there then it doesn't get

197
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,940
committed but it's just a script so if

198
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,740
you're not familiar with githooks

199
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,080
they're just scripts I love bash I'm a

200
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,960
huge bash nerd but if you want python or

201
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,660
PHP for some reason a ruby or whatever

202
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,060
executable environment you have you can

203
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,979
tap into that this is real thanks Ed

204
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,400
Thompson from npm and GitHub actions who

205
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,699
wrote get Dad which substitutes a dad a

206
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,800
substitutes get Dad forget ad and tells

207
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,819
you a dad joke along the way that's

208
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,319
where I stole the code which is just a

209
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,460
curl

210
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,060
um

211
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,500
but if we're gonna build what I just

212
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,539
talked about with that robot it would

213
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,180
look something kind of like this uh get

214
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,460
grep who here likes get crap anybody

215
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,680
know about this inside of git they built

216
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,380
grip it's just bash grub but it limits

217
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,759
what it's looking at at the index and

218
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,919
things that git knows about so it

219
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,900
resolves that entire problem of how do I

220
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,000
use grep to look at a thing it just

221
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,639
looks there that's just what it does

222
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,380
um anyway so we tell it hey look at this

223
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,060
arbitrary

224
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,580
um bit of regex because everybody loves

225
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,139
writing regex right

226
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:39,479
exactly all of it I just found out chat

227
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,000
GPT can write fairly good regex and

228
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,979
changed my life anyway

229
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:44,759
um

230
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,020
so we can build this all day

231
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,240
but then we have a few things to worry

232
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,080
about

233
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,060
would all the use cases I need to deal

234
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,099
with what about examples what about test

235
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,319
files what about this what about that

236
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,940
and then I have to maintain it unless

237
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,500
this is your full-time job to build this

238
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,639
thing

239
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,259
there's a lot of work nobody got time

240
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,400
for that

241
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,740
so there's some open source people that

242
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,419
already built this it's already there

243
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,280
the code I showed you earlier

244
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,979
is taken from well it's modified but

245
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,919
taken from get Secrets right AWS Labs

246
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,740
100 open source go grab it and if you

247
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,780
live breathe in all of your life is in

248
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,198
AWS

249
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,649
[Music]

250
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,680
by somebody on the team uh who put it

251
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,440
out there for free as an example and

252
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,059
people have extended it you can go find

253
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,120
for Google and Azure and other things

254
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,559
um there's company trufflehog they're

255
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,000
actually here as well

256
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,039
um they are built open source first and

257
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,380
they have Enterprise option these days

258
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,820
their core tool as far as I can tell

259
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,220
requires uses the pre-commit framework

260
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,580
which is a python framework that builds

261
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,080
pre-commit hooks

262
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,880
um it's a cool tool on its own nothing

263
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,380
against it just know that you have that

264
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,820
extra layer of

265
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,060
stuff we at get Guardian make GG Shield

266
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,740
which is an open source tool it does

267
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,200
require platform usage to actually do

268
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,899
the scanning and the brains behind it uh

269
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,240
but we get and get a free account there

270
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,680
are other tools like get leaks out there

271
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,779
that do the same thing

272
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,339
so you're not on your own building this

273
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,080
thing

274
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,880
or running this thing or installing this

275
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,620
thing in the case of GG Shield which is

276
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,180
the one that saved me because that's

277
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,500
what I run because while I work with you

278
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,519
guys

279
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,240
um

280
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,700
it was three lines one two install it

281
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,740
one to authenticate one to put the hook

282
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,240
in place I don't think about it anymore

283
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,339
it's just a global hook every time I do

284
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:37,080
a commit it always checks every time

285
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,200
even if I don't want it to which

286
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,580
your mileage may vary you can always

287
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,080
skip a hook if you want

288
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,180
you shouldn't skip hooks you put them in

289
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,680
place for a reason

290
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,940
what does that look like in action it

291
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,279
looks like this uh hey I got a secret

292
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,660
over here

293
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,760
I go and make a commit

294
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,800
hey this looks like that now

295
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,180
failed

296
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,740
didn't give me the area it doesn't give

297
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,899
me a commit now I can fix it my security

298
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,160
teams happened with me because I didn't

299
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,959
commit it I don't have to do surgical

300
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,899
removal of the get repo later and all

301
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,120
that surgery

302
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,240
so in conclusion it's only 10 minutes

303
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,800
don't hard code your secrets if you just

304
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,839
stop doing that then the rest of this

305
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,060
talk you can ignore uh don't commit your

306
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,940
secrets but yeah we're human beings

307
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,980
let's just be honest use automation to

308
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,519
your advantage get builds in hooks you

309
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,320
can do anything with it so why not do

310
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,480
security with it if I had more time we

311
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,620
could talk about all the other things

312
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,019
you could plug in with Git hooks like

313
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,240
anything any test tweet you ever wanted

314
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,279
that you can run from a CLI but that's

315
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,380
my talk and I'm out of time

316
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,779
unfortunately so uh questions

317
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,120
how do you make how do you make sure

318
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,519
people install this uh well that's a

319
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,720
good question there's the other side of

320
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,120
this is the detection side of secrets in

321
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
your environment and there are Suite of

322
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,360
tools out there we're one of them

323
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,579
um and if you end up with Secrets

324
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,040
getting pushed by a developer then you

325
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,019
know they didn't use it that's the short

326
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,660
answer uh if Secrets show up and you

327
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,339
have this strategy in place then you

328
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,800
know who was accepted and who hasn't in

329
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,079
their workflows that's uh other than

330
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,420
that it's just asking onboarding um this

331
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,620
is one of the reasons I personally love

332
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,120
Cloud development environments is

333
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,380
because you can pre-install them there

334
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,820
and you can just give your developer

335
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,940
like here's a URL everything you need

336
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,480
including the git hooks already there

337
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,800
other quick questions

338
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,200
oh cool yeah yeah great question how

339
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,579
does this differ from hashicorp Vault

340
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,500
are the other tools those are secret

341
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,760
managers so vault is a tool to store uh

342
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,380
properly store and then programmatically

343
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,019
call your credentials

344
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:51,000
um programmatically so instead of

345
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,920
password equals whatever your password

346
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,980
is password equals Vault Dot

347
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,200
something that whatever you called your

348
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,399
secret

349
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,680
um and it will it will Source it in so

350
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,360
when your code leaks because it's not if

351
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,240
when your code leaks a hacker or the

352
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,700
attacker will see okay they use vault

353
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,019
I'm not even gonna bother with this

354
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,100
let's just Google into something else

355
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,360
there's got to be a better way to get in

356
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,019
can you done the server side absolutely

357
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,380
um so back on hooks uh uh

358
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,240
pre-receive

359
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,220
but yeah pre-receive is a hook that runs

360
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,779
on the server side and get and this is

361
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,399
like out of the get book

362
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,959
um so pre-receive is a hook that runs on

363
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,820
the server side that will do whatever

364
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,700
the script says you can install uh GG

365
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,140
Shield

366
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,339
um

367
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,399
I think get Secrets out of an AWS uh for

368
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,540
sure you can just set up his

369
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,940
pre-received hooks and it will check the

370
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,680
commit before it actually gets sent and

371
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,240
if it's anything in order to shut it

372
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,360
down

373
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,680
I can't hear you man sorry

374
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,980
well this is the thing it is a developer

375
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,779
tools because they're using git locally

376
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:05,760
so this is going to be dependent on the

377
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,700
developer but again you can hook this in

378
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,339
if you're if you're starting to go down

379
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,320
the cloud development environment route

380
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,899
you can pre-build it in there for your

381
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,720
developers your onboarding or per

382
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,639
per project

383
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,380
um but yeah there's not a way to like

384
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,779
globally unless you can globally enforce

385
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,120
developer tools on all your developer

386
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,920
machines

387
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,360
if you can do that then you can do this

388
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,220
but if if you don't have that superpower

389
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,380
I don't know how you do that

390
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,380
foreign

391
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,560
the question was why isn't this

392
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,500
automatically integrated into an IDE uh

393
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,300
that's a great question

394
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,700
but I think that same question can be

395
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,380
asked about a lot of technology that I

396
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,100
like

397
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,000
um

398
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,040
like it's like the lunting question all

399
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,079
over again like lenting is the best idea

400
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,880
until it's not and then you work around

401
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,200
it and then your code gets messy

402
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,420
one more yeah okay I got time for one

403
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,139
more you just told me

404
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,339
well thank you very much everybody I

405
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,839
really appreciate you being here have a

406
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,980
great rest of your b-sides
