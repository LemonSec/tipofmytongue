Terry o'daniels talking about going far

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,340
together and how to build your squad

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,259
I'll hand it on over and let's give a

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,099
quick Round of Applause

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,980
hey everyone if I can just fight through

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,500
this crowd for a second to see you all

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,660
oh there you are okay good

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,439
um welcome to the approaching the end of

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,140
b-sides thank you all for showing up and

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,059
I hope we have a little fun

14
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,920
so my name is Terry O'Daniel and today

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,300
I'm going to be talking about building

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,059
your squad

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,860
picture this

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,420
you're defending your company's critical

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,700
infrastructure from a Cyber attack

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,760
you're feeling overwhelmed and alone

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,879
the clock is ticking the stakes are high

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,940
and the pressure is immense

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,460
you're working tirelessly

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,320
but you feel like you're in this battle

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,699
alone

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,060
and you're starting to feel despair

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,979
sound familiar

28
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,140
or how about this

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,520
you're trying to get to the next level

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,320
in your career

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,760
or maybe you're dealing with an

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,880
unexpected setback like a layoff

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,159
you've been updating your resume and

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,080
you've been watching Interview videos on

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,060
LinkedIn and YouTube

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,759
but you can't seem to make it past the

37
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,040
first round of interviews at any job you

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,080
apply

39
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,180
hmm

40
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,380
well what if I told you there's a

41
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,720
powerful tool to help you overcome these

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,220
kinds of obstacles

43
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,520
it's not a fancy technology or a secret

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,720
hack

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,299
but rather it's just the power of other

46
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,340
people

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,380
just like in any great adventure having

48
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,979
a team of trusted peers by your side can

49
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,360
make the difference

50
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,920
So today we're going to explore how to

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
build your squad and why it can be a

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,720
game changer in your journey

53
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,720
so let's start with the preface of this

54
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,060
entire talk

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,899
if you want to go fast go alone if you

56
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,940
want to go far go together

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,319
so let's start with talking about the

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,959
power of peers

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,340
here's a quick overview of the four

60
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,599
areas we're going to discuss today

61
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,180
okay

62
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,920
let's dive into the first aspect of

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,400
building your squad finding common cause

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,980
just like in any Mission a strong sense

65
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,860
of shared purpose helps bring a squad

66
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,120
together

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,300
it binds its members to a common purpose

68
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,519
and in the cyber security field that

69
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,379
means finding peers who shame share

70
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,959
similar goals who appreciate the same

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,400
challenges or even who have common

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,660
interests

73
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,220
it could be a group of like-minded

74
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,080
Professionals in the company you work at

75
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,220
now

76
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,080
it could be a local cyber security

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
Meetup or it can be an online community

78
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,420
or even a gathering of cyber Security

79
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,080
Professionals in one place like b-sides

80
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,760
find those people

81
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,220
join forces with them and support each

82
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,580
other in having common goals

83
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,480
let's talk about the power of

84
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,099
transparency

85
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,680
in cyber security knowledge is power and

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,900
that includes knowledge about pay and

87
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,459
promotions

88
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,340
did you know that the gender pay Gap in

89
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,319
the cyber security industry is a

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,319
well-documented issue I sure did

91
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,239
according to a study by the center for

92
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,280
cyber safety and education

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,239
women in cyber security on average earn

94
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,340
17 percent less than men

95
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,739
it's time to change that

96
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,200
by being transparent about your pay and

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
the promotion process you're going

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,440
through within your squad

99
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,959
you can advocate for fair and Equitable

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,000
treatments around compensation and

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,799
promotion and you can promote diversity

102
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,659
and inclusion within the field

103
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,580
so let's talk about the importance of

104
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,319
mentoring and sponsorship within your

105
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,540
squad mentoring is a powerful tool for

106
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,760
professional growth and sponsorship can

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,159
open doors to new opportunities

108
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,738
in fact research shows that employees

109
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:19,139
who have mentors are more likely to be

110
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,600
promoted earn higher salaries and have

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,060
greater job satisfaction

112
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,340
to seek out mentors and find sponsors

113
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,740
within your squad but also be willing to

114
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,020
mentor and sponsor others

115
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,180
let's lift each other up and help each

116
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,500
other thrive in our careers

117
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,340
last we'll talk a little bit about

118
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,720
resilience

119
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,639
cyber security is a dynamic field with

120
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,160
its fair share of challenges and it has

121
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,699
setbacks and even failures

122
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,860
but it's how we bounce back that matters

123
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,440
and your squad can be a source of

124
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,360
strength during tough times

125
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,820
lean on each other for support

126
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,639
share your Lessons Learned and celebrate

127
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,259
your successes together

128
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,840
by building a resilient Squad you can

129
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,900
weather the storms of cyber security and

130
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,580
your career and you can come out

131
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,599
stronger on the other side

132
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,979
so let's start

133
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:15,600
by talking about the importance of

134
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,220
collaboration and knowledge sharing

135
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,840
within your squad

136
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,639
staying up to date on the latest threats

137
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,460
challenges and Technologies is a key

138
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,500
part of our field but we can't do it

139
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,639
alone

140
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,740
your squad can be a valuable source of

141
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,600
collective intelligence

142
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,639
share your knowledge experience as an

143
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,680
Insight with your peers and learn from

144
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,120
them

145
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,000
collaboration not only strengthens your

146
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
skills but also also Fosters Innovation

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,160
and creativity leading to better

148
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,699
outcomes in your cyber security efforts

149
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,220
in fact research shows

150
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,500
that those who are collaborating are

151
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,419
five times more likely to perform at

152
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,080
higher levels

153
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,860
let's discuss the power of networking

154
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,300
and building those meaningful

155
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,400
relationships within your squad

156
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,500
cyber security is obviously a very

157
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,560
rapidly evolving field and it's not just

158
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,620
about what you know but who you know

159
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,780
building a professional network of

160
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,940
trusted peers can provide you with

161
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,039
opportunities for career advancement

162
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,020
it can give you industry insights and it

163
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,759
can even give you job referrals for your

164
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,080
next role

165
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,780
so attend those industry events join

166
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,600
professional organizations and actively

167
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,259
engage but bring your squad along

168
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,780
network with intention and build

169
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,180
meaningful connections that can help you

170
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,039
succeed in your cyber security career

171
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,840
so let's talk about diversity inclusion

172
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,759
in your squad

173
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,039
cyber security I firmly believe is a

174
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,840
field that benefits greatly from diverse

175
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,479
perspectives backgrounds and experiences

176
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,520
think about the last time you did a risk

177
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,539
analysis

178
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,280
look around the room

179
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,620
if everyone looked like you during that

180
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,120
analysis do you really have the right

181
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,800
perspectives

182
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,360
Studies have shown that diverse teams

183
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,400
are more Innovative resilient and

184
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,919
effective at problem solving so Embrace

185
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,319
diversity within your squad and actively

186
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,660
seek out diverse voices and participants

187
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,100
for your squad

188
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,500
find those New Perspectives and Foster

189
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,000
an inclusive environment where everyone

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
feels welcome

191
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,979
if you build an environment of respect

192
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,139
and you make sure that everyone has a

193
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,940
voice and can be heard within your squad

194
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,400
you're building an inclusive environment

195
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
and you promote fairness inequality

196
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,020
within your squad but you're also

197
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,580
promoting the overall performance and

198
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,160
success of the team

199
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,840
finally let's talk about the importance

200
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,120
of continuous Learning and Development

201
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,860
cyber security is a field that always

202
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,620
requires us to learn and grow and build

203
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,919
those skills due to its Dynamic nature

204
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,139
so I encourage you to stay curious seek

205
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,120
out learning opportunities and encourage

206
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,340
your squad members to do the same

207
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,780
whether it's attending a training

208
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,539
program obtaining a certification or

209
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,940
participating in Industry conferences

210
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,580
invest in your professional growth and

211
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,220
Inspire your squad to do the same

212
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,380
by sharing that continuous learning with

213
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,900
your squad you can stay ahead even in a

214
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,599
fast based security field like cyber

215
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,780
security

216
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,860
so 72 percent

217
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,440
of employees surveyed

218
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,660
believe that their peers are the best

219
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,940
source for Learning and diversity or

220
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,800
excuse me for Learning and Development

221
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,419
and yet so frequently we go to our

222
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,279
managers for Learning and Development

223
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,820
opportunities

224
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,700
let's talk about transparency in the

225
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,260
cyber security industry and especially

226
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,500
when it comes to pay and promotion

227
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,720
transparency is a key component of

228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,100
building Trust

229
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,760
and fostering a healthy environment

230
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,860
in cyber security it's crucial to have

231
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,140
open and honest communication

232
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,480
but about not just technical elements

233
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
but also around pay promotions and

234
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,740
career opportunities

235
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,320
discussing salaries openly sharing

236
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
information about the promotion process

237
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,240
and advocating for fair compensation can

238
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,700
help break down inequalities and promote

239
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,779
fairness

240
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,820
transparency also promotes

241
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,680
accountability

242
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,600
and encourages organizations to

243
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,459
prioritize diversity equity and

244
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,600
inclusion

245
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,940
so let's work together to create that

246
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,220
culture of transparency within our Squad

247
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,320
and then take those Lessons Learned back

248
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,279
to our place of business

249
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,800
and how the squad can help with that

250
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,899
in cyber security it's important to

251
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,100
stand up for yourself

252
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,839
and for your peers

253
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,820
it's important to take defensible

254
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,640
positions and Advocate and argue for a

255
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,040
position you strongly believe in

256
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,920
don't be afraid to negotiate in the same

257
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,220
way for fair pay promotions that are

258
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,160
Equitable and other career opportunities

259
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,220
advocate for yourself and for others in

260
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,100
your squad who may be facing challenges

261
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,260
workshop with them how you approach that

262
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,959
situation maybe they can learn from it

263
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,940
by collectively advocating for fair

264
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,040
treatment and helping others see how you

265
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,440
do that we can all create a more

266
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,600
inclusive and Equitable environment in

267
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,860
this industry

268
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,080
remember you're not alone on this

269
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,720
journey but by supporting each other we

270
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,560
can go far together

271
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,060
and in fact supporting each other

272
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,500
through challenges is one of the key

273
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,320
benefits of this squad

274
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,480
there's a vast importance to mentorship

275
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,540
and sponsorship in building your career

276
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,040
but you can find those opportunities

277
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,959
within your squad as well

278
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,240
mentorship can pay a pivotal role in

279
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,459
professional developments by providing

280
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,100
guidance insights and opportunities for

281
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,480
growth

282
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,760
but seek out mentors within your squad

283
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,060
who can provide that same advice and

284
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,880
support and create opportunities

285
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,339
mentorship mentorship and sponsorship

286
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,040
can help level the playing field and

287
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,380
create a more inclusive industry in

288
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,839
cyber security where everyone has equal

289
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,240
access to growth and advancement but it

290
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,339
starts by working on that muscle with

291
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,880
your squad

292
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,360
finally let's talk about resilience and

293
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,320
supporting each other through

294
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,779
challenging times

295
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,880
the cyber security field can be

296
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,360
demanding and it can be stressful

297
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,160
so it's essential to create a supportive

298
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,620
environment within your squad

299
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,899
be there for your peers

300
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,000
during challenging times

301
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,860
offer them a helping hand and provide

302
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,540
them emotional support

303
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,579
building a resilient and supportive

304
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,700
Squad can help you overcome obstacles

305
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,740
navigate through setbacks in your career

306
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,800
and thrive in your career overall

307
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,959
remember we're all in this together but

308
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,300
by supporting each other we can build a

309
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,100
strong and resilient cyber security

310
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,579
community

311
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,480
studies show that

312
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,720
groups that have a peer support group to

313
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,620
fall back on feel 40 percent less

314
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,500
stress and likelihood of burnout

315
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,279
that's huge

316
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,240
so let's talk about what you can do

317
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,560
with some of the tips I've given you

318
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,660
here

319
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,579
in this final section of the talk

320
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,680
we're going to talk about actions you

321
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,200
can take to build that Squad and ways

322
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,459
you can bring those learnings back to

323
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,920
the larger industry

324
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,380
it's time to empower yourself

325
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,420
by creating a network of like-minded

326
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,120
professionals who can support each other

327
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,040
by collaborating and leveraging the

328
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,079
power of collective effort

329
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,899
we can achieve remarkable things

330
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,120
so let's dive into some practical steps

331
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,399
for how to build your squad and go far

332
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,320
together

333
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,300
the first step in building your squad is

334
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,220
to identify common goals and interests

335
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,899
why is this group of people coll

336
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,639
collecting together

337
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,200
so look for those peers who share

338
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,300
similar Passions

339
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,480
similar mindset career aspers

340
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,779
aspirations ways of working different

341
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,899
ways of working or core values

342
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,639
you can connect through professional

343
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,019
organizations

344
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,500
online forums industry events

345
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,240
conferences and even within your current

346
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,440
company

347
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,920
so collaborate on projects together

348
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,560
share knowledge and expertise and

349
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,139
support each other's growth

350
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,540
together we're stronger so by aligning

351
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,000
with those like-minded professionals you

352
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,600
amplify your impact in the industry and

353
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
you're amplifying your ability to find

354
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,339
success within your career

355
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:53,279
the second step is to create that

356
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,980
culture of inclusivity and collaboration

357
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,200
within your squad no one's going to

358
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,540
create it for you so the onus is on each

359
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,980
member of the squad to create this

360
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,420
actively

361
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,399
Foster an environment where everyone's

362
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,160
voice is heard and respected regardless

363
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,620
of their experience level or background

364
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,139
find ways to ensure that everyone's

365
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,420
voice everyone has an opportunity to

366
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,760
speak not everyone is an extrovert

367
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,380
sometimes you'll have to create

368
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,420
structures to make time for people to be

369
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,599
heard

370
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,620
you can encourage open discussion

371
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,920
feedback one-on-one sessions and

372
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,540
brainstorming sessions

373
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,880
but by diversity by embracing that

374
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,279
diversity of thought and promoting those

375
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,700
inclusive practices actively

376
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,040
you create an environment where everyone

377
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,079
feels that their career is valued

378
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,100
equally

379
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,500
and everyone has an increased chance of

380
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,620
success in those careers

381
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,880
the third step

382
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,500
is to support each other's professional

383
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,779
growth and development directly

384
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,339
so share those resources that have

385
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,860
helped you recommend relevant training

386
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,100
and certification programs that work

387
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,779
steer people away from the ones that are

388
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,240
bad provide each other with feedback

389
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,880
provide each other with guidance

390
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,800
celebrate each other's successes provide

391
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,040
constructive feedback on how to improve

392
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,899
create those opportunities for

393
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,519
mentorship either directly within your

394
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,500
squad or indirectly

395
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,380
find sponsors and align them with your

396
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,399
squad mates and ultimately collaborate

397
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,680
and support each other's growth in an

398
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,839
active way

399
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,899
we can collectively Elevate our

400
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,760
profession and we can collectively make

401
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,980
a positive impact on the industry

402
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,160
through these small steps

403
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,920
so let's review

404
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,899
building your squad in cyber security is

405
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,300
not just nice to have it's a must-have

406
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,699
for success in this challenging field

407
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,940
as we've discussed creating small cadres

408
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,000
of peers who support each other can help

409
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,100
you navigate your career increase

410
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,560
transparency and overcome challenging

411
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,579
times

412
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,279
so I encourage each and every one of you

413
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,740
to take this action today reach out to

414
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,139
your colleagues form your squad and

415
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,100
embark on this journey

416
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,079
well folks that's a wrap we've covered a

417
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,820
lot of ground today from the importance

418
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,740
of building your squad to strategies for

419
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,380
success now let's recap what we've

420
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,320
learned in hopefully a fun and memorable

421
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,639
way

422
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,459
first of all we're all in this together

423
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,560
it's like being in the Avengers except

424
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,839
we have firewalls instead of capes

425
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,699
by building your own Squad of

426
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,920
like-minded professionals you can

427
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,740
collaborate support each other and make

428
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,920
a real difference in the industry

429
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,540
your squad is not just about saving the

430
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,579
world from cyber threats it's also about

431
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,160
having a support system that understands

432
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,680
your cyber security jokes and shares

433
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,899
your love for Star Wars references

434
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,079
plus having a crew to commiserate with

435
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,839
when that late night patching goes awry

436
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,420
is invaluable

437
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,660
so here's the bottom line don't go solo

438
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,160
in cyber security

439
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,040
find your squad Foster a culture of

440
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,799
collaboration and inclusivity and

441
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,660
support each other's growth

442
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,299
together we can raise the bar in our

443
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:21,059
industry and make our Mark as cyber

444
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:24,299
security superheroes

445
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,919
I challenge each of you to take action

446
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,640
today

447
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,679
connect with your peers start building

448
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:30,419
your squad and take some of these

449
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:33,120
concrete steps let's make this industry

450
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,799
better and stronger

451
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,539
we can do it together

452
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:37,919
thanks for coming with me on this

453
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,960
journey and remember with the right

454
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,780
Squad by your side you can conquer any

455
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,059
challenge that comes in your way

456
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,700
thank you so much

457
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,340
[Applause]

458
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,620
amazing thank you Terry do we have any

459
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,660
questions

460
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,440
we have some time

461
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,600
do you have any uh anecdotal Lessons

462
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,539
Learned or just you know stories from in

463
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,360
the trenches thanks for asking

464
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,740
um

465
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,360
I don't remember if we're under Chatham

466
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,400
House Rules here or not so I'll slightly

467
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,500
anonymize them I think one of the

468
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,380
biggest challenges I've had is there's a

469
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,640
there's a real

470
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,799
motion currently within the cyber

471
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,440
community towards sharing the mic and I

472
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,360
am incredibly supportive to bring to

473
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,460
share the mic with those who are have

474
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,260
been underserved who haven't had a voice

475
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,960
within the cyber community but I'd also

476
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,820
like to see people get paid

477
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,100
and one of the things that I've actively

478
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,620
involved with is making sure that people

479
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,020
who are more Junior in our industry have

480
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,940
the exposure to those of us who've been

481
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,880
around a little longer around what they

482
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,980
should be asking for how they should be

483
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,140
negotiating and and what are the

484
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,940
sometimes the differences from industry

485
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,640
to Industry how do you negotiate in this

486
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,679
industry maybe we talk about total comp

487
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,720
and then this industry base and bonus

488
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,400
are more important I think that is

489
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,140
absolutely Far and Away something I

490
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,880
would love for all of us to really lean

491
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,820
in find the most Junior person you can

492
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,460
invoke the cone of silence and tell them

493
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,740
about your own Journey so that they can

494
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,059
understand what they should be expecting

495
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,139
in their own career

496
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,299
I guess uh when I saw your talks

497
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,039
abstract I thought it was more about

498
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,020
like assembling a team for a purpose and

499
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,539
it seemed to be related to like MIT card

500
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,340
counting at least the uh you know

501
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,679
illusion in the in the title but in

502
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,419
terms of assembling a squad for a

503
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:40,320
purpose

504
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
uh how do you know you have the right

505
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,980
members how do you know you need to

506
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,820
recruit more and where to recruit

507
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,160
I think this is for a purpose right I do

508
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,500
think we you know it's a bit like

509
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,419
collective bargaining right you're

510
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,160
putting together effort for a common

511
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,620
goal even though your own you're only

512
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,080
trying to help yourself you understand

513
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,640
the value of bringing those people

514
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,500
together for that that Collective action

515
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,120
so I think

516
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,280
I call out two things briefly one is

517
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,679
there is a

518
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,480
um there's a high likelihood that you

519
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,840
will start your squad in a least diverse

520
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,620
way

521
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,360
right because you're most likely to

522
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,500
start with people that you're most

523
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,000
familiar with and studies show that

524
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,679
people were most familiar with have the

525
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,480
highest degree of commonality with us we

526
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,460
went to the same University we grew up

527
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,260
together we probably morphologically

528
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,440
look the same so I think it's okay to

529
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,480
start there but if you continue down

530
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,860
that path you're not doing yourself any

531
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,440
favors so I think you have to build in

532
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,080
active growth checks whereby you might

533
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,140
say okay the three of us that's good

534
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,400
enough but you know what if we add a

535
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,559
fourth person it can't be another white

536
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,520
guy

537
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,260
right so I think that's that's one way

538
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,539
to approach it and to have uh growth

539
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,820
checks I think another way is by

540
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,080
bringing in people to share their

541
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,880
perspective because you never know in

542
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,380
the course of those conversations you

543
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,000
may find an ally and they may become a

544
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,440
member of your squad whether it's for a

545
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,660
common purpose at an organization or for

546
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,620
a common purpose like this

547
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,900
uh yeah I also don't mean to sound

548
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,580
argumentative but my question was also

549
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,240
regarding Dei you mentioned uh that you

550
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,580
possibly don't want to hire people who

551
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,640
might you know look like you in order to

552
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,820
get a diversity of ideas right

553
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,220
um how important is it to really test

554
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,039
people not just on that

555
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,000
um inherent trait of appearance or race

556
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,120
or you know sexual orientation Etc but

557
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,860
on their ideas within the interview

558
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,780
process

559
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,940
yeah that's a great question and I to be

560
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,260
clear I don't think I said that we

561
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,000
shouldn't hire people to look like us I

562
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,380
I suggested that when you're building

563
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,299
your squad at a certain point you need

564
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:49,679
to make sure that you're looking outside

565
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,720
the closeness Circle that you're used to

566
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,280
and you're comfortable with

567
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,260
to that point though I do think there's

568
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,460
a huge

569
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,100
um there's a diversity of thought

570
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,260
um

571
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,280
I I am a disabled neurodiverse single

572
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,120
dad

573
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,100
there are several elements of diversity

574
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,080
there uh I do think however there are

575
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,340
morphological elements that if I look

576
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,039
around a room and everyone's a man I

577
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,860
think there's a problem because 50 of

578
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,919
our world is women so I do think there

579
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,539
are some morphological elements that we

580
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,520
we should look at and we should ask

581
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,679
ourselves hey that's an awfully white

582
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,320
room or gosh why is it all men in that

583
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,780
room and I think those are perfectly

584
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,539
okay ways to start because visually we

585
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,360
get a read on a group based on some of

586
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
those morphological traits so it comes

587
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,580
down to say life experience that's de

588
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,520
facto coupled to who you are right is

589
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,720
what you're saying yeah I would say it

590
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,280
doesn't I would say there's a strong

591
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,020
correlation but it doesn't have to be

592
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,960
causation is someone who was raised in

593
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,299
an inner city environment necessarily

594
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,480
also from a economically disadvantaged

595
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,340
home not necessarily but there's a

596
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,900
correlation

597
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,100
appreciate it thank you

598
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,400
I guess one more follow-up is well okay

599
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,320
let's pretend we're doing a startup if I

600
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,360
if I just hire engineers and I can have

601
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,700
a diverse sense of Engineers but if

602
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,260
we're not reaching beyond the

603
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,240
engineering mindset where like we we

604
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,640
have to have sales we have to have uh

605
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,960
you know marketing folks we could have

606
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,000
to get out of that comfort zone as well

607
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,500
so you get a diversity of perspectives

608
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,340
from other disciplines as well right so

609
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,200
um this is sort of like

610
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,880
back to the crack team thing I'm

611
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,380
thinking like do we need a guy who can

612
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,299
do safes do we need a new guy who can

613
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:44,100
like do uh hacking blah blah but I think

614
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,220
Purity I think there's there's enough

615
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,539
diversity of approach uh for example

616
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:56,360
I have used uh the the rigor with which

617
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,179
GRC people approach a problem space I

618
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:01,799
have sometimes asked them to come help

619
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:04,140
out our vulnerability Management program

620
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,780
right because GRC does a great job of

621
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,120
sort of taking a huge unexplainable

622
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,799
problem and turning it into a framework

623
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,120
and then we've got a list of 20 things

624
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,919
we're going to do right whereas as we

625
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,299
know vulnerability can be something that

626
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,799
we just we feel like it just grinds on

627
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,600
never ends so I do think there's it's

628
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,100
important I don't know that we need to

629
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,780
bring in sales people and marketing

630
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,640
people yet but I do think even within

631
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,580
cyber security there are difference in

632
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,460
approaches and differences in values

633
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,440
even right do we care about speed or

634
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,299
quality more depends on who you ask

635
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,720
it will be our last one

636
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,240
yeah to that point I guess you know

637
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,740
maybe I was expecting something a little

638
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,780
bit different but you know what I think

639
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,760
about my squad at least within my

640
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,460
organization it's my head of legal my

641
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,020
head of quality and compliance it's

642
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,659
folks outside of security who are

643
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,320
natural allies in the challenges that we

644
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,179
have to address

645
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:01,039
um

646
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,500
what's been your experience you know

647
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,900
bringing in people from outside the

648
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,659
industry into that Squad that's a good

649
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:10,919
question actually I

650
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,320
um I've worked with this this is from

651
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,580
personal experience I've used this a few

652
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,940
times and I do have squads where uh some

653
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,900
folks most people tend to have a general

654
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,159
background in technology and they

655
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,559
understand how like the modern tech

656
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,840
stack Works they may not be Hands-On but

657
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,059
we can have a conversation right like if

658
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,100
I say Docker they know what I'm talking

659
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,260
about right that's that tends to be my

660
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,600
self-selection criteria but within that

661
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,100
certainly we've had people who have

662
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,500
worked more in the VC space and they can

663
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,539
help us understand

664
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:44,039
how the money people are going to react

665
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,480
to the things we're talking about or the

666
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,799
things we're building I've worked with

667
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,779
people who have gone from working in the

668
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:49,760
cyber security

669
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,220
profession as an operator to becoming a

670
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,500
a product person within a cyber security

671
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,980
uh tools vendor and yeah so I I do think

672
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,380
those are related

673
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,720
areas that we're talking about but with

674
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,900
different perspectives

675
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,520
advice that I had earlier on in my

676
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,740
career was essentially you know as

677
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,539
you're you're socializing and you're

678
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:13,919
building these networks within your

679
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,440
organization you want to try to reach a

680
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,659
level higher rather than at the peer

681
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:19,980
level

682
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,659
um Can the same thing be applied to

683
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,940
squads

684
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,620
that is a really good and really tough

685
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,760
question and we may not have time to

686
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,520
answer it I would say

687
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,380
um squads tend to have a natural life

688
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,240
cycle

689
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,940
but you probably want to push them to

690
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,140
end sooner

691
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,460
and we talked a little earlier about

692
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,380
having to be intentional about like what

693
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,760
are we going to do over the next two

694
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,940
months four months three years Etc you

695
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,740
may want to Define

696
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,299
um like what is the life of this fund

697
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:50,520
what is the life of this squad and that

698
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,740
way it there's there's less of a sense

699
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,480
that this is just something that is

700
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,760
going to persist forever but rather it

701
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,020
is a temporary thing that we're all

702
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,360
using for value and I think it builds a

703
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,100
little more commitment because people

704
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,720
realize that I can only take advantage

705
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,820
of this for so long

706
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,340
wonderful thank you that was me another

707
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,379
round of applause please thank you
