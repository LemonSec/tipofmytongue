1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:03,659
hello hello good afternoon uh let's

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,580
welcome John Betty to the stage he's

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,080
going to talk to us about all of the

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,179
millions and millions of devices that he

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,500
has hacked over time he's come to

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,559
another from the iot village so give it

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,610
up and thank you very much

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,788
[Applause]

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,180
kind of allergic to podiums so I'm just

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,340
gonna talk like this

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,159
so welcome everybody I'm John Becky um

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,840
I'm the chief marketing officer at

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,540
phosphorus cyber security

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,379
um been in this business 25 plus years

15
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,000
I've been on the front of a lot of

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,100
different categories in this in this

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,500
industry but this is one that I've

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,660
always known is very big

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,160
um and so what I'm going to present

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,780
today I'm going to talk about this isn't

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,039
a product pitch

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,780
I'm going to talk about the state of

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,420
this industry the types of devices that

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,039
are out there we're going to walk

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,719
through some of the issues with these

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,820
devices I'm going to talk about some of

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,099
the prominent attacks and attack vectors

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,580
that are hitting these devices today and

29
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,500
right around the 10 minute Mark I'm

30
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,080
going to hurry up over to an actual

31
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,640
camera hack because I want to show you

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,939
guys an actual hack on a camera I don't

33
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,320
have much time but I'm going to kind of

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,180
squeeze that in

35
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,740
um so in any event let's kind of get

36
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,259
started I call it xiot

37
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,180
stands for extended internet of things

38
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,560
and what does that mean

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
there are multiple kind of pillars of X

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600
iot devices because there's so many and

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,100
they range from what we call kind of

42
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,920
Enterprise iot devices think of these

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,600
kind of in what I call the carpeted

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,000
areas of Enterprises right cameras

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,240
printers VoIP phones layer Layer Two

46
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,640
kind of switches load balancers HVAC

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,460
controllers smart card and cacs and all

48
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,320
those kind of things you'd see in a kind

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,659
of Enterprise environment then you have

50
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,640
OT operational technology these are

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,780
things like ICS devices plcs critical

52
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,880
infrastructure skated devices all those

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,399
kinds of things right then you have iomt

54
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,200
devices internet of medical devices

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,179
these are things like infusion pumps

56
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,099
wearable medical devices all the things

57
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,500
you'd find these are oftentimes life

58
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,940
critical devices

59
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,160
and then you have what's called iiot

60
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,959
industrial Internet of Things these

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,640
would be in kind of discrete and batch

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,920
manufacturing all those kinds of things

63
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,440
so there's tons of these devices you can

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,140
see some of them here but there's

65
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,459
similar things across any of these

66
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,560
devices that are very common right

67
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,599
they're all purpose built

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,239
right they're all basically just Linux

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,640
servers running a flavor of Linux it

70
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,300
might be Android BSD busy box VX Works a

71
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,400
host of different kind of operating

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,379
systems but they're all basically Linux

73
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,780
based you can't point you can't put

74
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,700
endpoint agents on this right so you

75
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,980
can't put Titanium or crowdstrike on

76
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,260
these things uh they're not traditional

77
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,500
I.T assets they're very different right

78
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,840
uh and they're all Network connected

79
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,760
they speak tcpip

80
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,180
they love to connect right uh and so

81
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,640
that's kind of the state of these things

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,819
right and there are many many of these

83
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,500
so there's a different ways to kind of

84
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,900
look at how big this is but since I've

85
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,580
been in this industry I'm just showing

86
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,739
you kind of let's compare kind of cloud

87
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,080
security with endpoint security with

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,120
this security right so endpoint security

89
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,519
right there's about as many endpoint

90
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,739
devices on the planet as there are

91
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,260
people right it's probably five to six

92
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,840
billion on any given day right and just

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,580
so you know the number of those devices

94
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,159
every year is decreasing

95
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,760
it's not increasing it's decreasing okay

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,040
um Cloud security there's about 10

97
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,959
million physical servers that make up

98
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,459
the cloud security Market that's not

99
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,739
that many servers not counting virtual

100
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,140
ones but physical ones right so you can

101
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,739
see that when you get to X iot

102
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:56,459
upwards of

103
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,920
60 70 billion of these things already

104
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,379
and by the way that's increasing about

105
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,560
18 to 20 percent every year so these

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,739
devices are exploding in size right

107
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,540
they're everywhere they're smart devices

108
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,920
right

109
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,260
so let's talk about the state of these

110
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,700
because that's really why what I want to

111
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,380
talk about today we know how many of

112
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,199
these devices there are but in simple

113
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,238
terms they're a mess

114
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,160
okay these things are absolutely

115
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,160
insecure and by any other kind of view

116
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,979
of cyber security the state of these

117
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,780
devices from a security perspective is

118
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,540
an epic fail okay and every day I'm in

119
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,979
this business it's kind of like I'm back

120
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,860
in 1992. and if you literally think of

121
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,259
where we were in about 1992 with iced

122
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,820
tea security that's where we are today

123
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,759
with this right the most basic table

124
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,520
stake security is not even present in a

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,320
lot of these devices but they're being

126
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,000
targeted in a big way so let's talk

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,500
about why they're being targeted But

128
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,479
first you guys know Showdown you under

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,000
you see shodanya so showdown's awesome

130
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,100
you can just go up and do a search so I

131
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,740
did a kind of basic search on Showdown I

132
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,660
went and looked for cameras and void

133
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,000
phones and printers and UPS right

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
uninterruptible power supplies and I

135
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,900
just said how many of these devices at

136
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,460
this time and this day when I did this

137
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,380
search are available to me that were

138
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,820
Network connected on the open internet

139
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,300
so cameras close to five million of them

140
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,560
right

141
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,340
VoIP phones 250 plus thousand of those

142
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,940
right printers at that time but 83 000

143
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,280
Network connected devices all of those

144
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,500
like ridiculously insecure and I'll talk

145
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,240
about why then you have something like

146
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,220
UPS's right and then just kind of look

147
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,620
at that and say why on Earth there would

148
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,820
be 14

149
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,060
000 UPS's connected to the open internet

150
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,860
is beyond me

151
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,300
but the reality is 100 of those devices

152
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,580
we've been interrogating these things

153
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,220
for six years interrogated millions of

154
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,979
them 100 percent of them

155
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,100
are deployed with default credentials

156
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,780
and if I mentioned default credentials

157
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,400
today it's not anything secret you can

158
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,960
go to Google and do the search on it

159
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,180
every single one of them has the default

160
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,400
credentials anyone want to guess

161
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,520
APC APC isn't that amazing

162
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,220
100 of them right

163
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,620
um again across all of these pretty much

164
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,240
all deployed mostly with default

165
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,600
credentials and so let's talk about the

166
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,940
target of these devices so if you're

167
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,620
familiar with front on maybe you've

168
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,360
heard of it right

169
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,639
so front end is a serious piece of

170
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,919
enterprise software okay I mean at

171
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,900
phosphorus we built a platform to secure

172
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,580
these devices and it's a serious piece

173
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,680
of enterprise software this is a serious

174
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,900
piece of enterprise software designed by

175
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,940
the Russian FSB to pretty much hack any

176
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,240
X iot device on the planet right in

177
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,819
addition to that it has incredibly

178
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,400
sophisticated social networking per

179
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,240
capabilities on it so it can launch

180
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,039
hundreds of social media accounts right

181
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,759
and spawn them and upload disinformation

182
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,220
right so this thing is a serious piece

183
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,960
of enterprise software but what happened

184
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,819
is the digital Revolution which is a

185
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:06,900
hacking group

186
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,139
hacked the Russian FSB and just release

187
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,020
this on BitTorrent right so now it's on

188
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,060
all your favorite torrents it's a

189
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,280
military nation state piece of of

190
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,280
software hacking and it's basically out

191
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,039
there available to anybody today right

192
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,319
and so this thing is sophisticated but

193
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,240
it brings up a point why would Russia

194
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,400
the Russian FSB spend all this time to

195
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,900
build a piece of firmware like this

196
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,000
software like this for hacking

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,699
because they know no one's looking at

198
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,860
this stuff right they're a mess they're

199
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,960
deployed with default credentials they

200
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,360
they ship with critical cves of eight

201
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,180
nine and ten right uh The Firm were six

202
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,639
seven years old ports and protocols open

203
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,800
all over the place no one's looking at

204
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,080
it why what could go wrong right so why

205
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,940
would they not focus on this stuff right

206
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,340
so that's that you're gonna see this

207
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,240
more and more then you have things like

208
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,880
banned iot devices so back in about you

209
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,199
know 2018 HR 5515 basically from the US

210
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,479
you know federal government said you

211
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:12,180
cannot deploy certain technology made by

212
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,940
China on on U.S federal networks right

213
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,880
well last last year at the end of last

214
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,539
year the FCC actually banned this stuff

215
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,160
everywhere so you can't import or deploy

216
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,139
because of a national security threat

217
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,660
why would they do that well because this

218
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,560
stuff

219
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,780
comes into the country pretty much ready

220
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,479
to hack and I talk about this wise the

221
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,899
wyze camera for from about 2018 to about

222
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,839
2021 or so if you went to Amazon and

223
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,240
said show me the best security camera on

224
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,940
Amazon Amazon's favorite it was the wise

225
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,180
camera right uh and that thing was

226
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,580
pretty special because it just it just

227
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,279
bypassed all kind of middlemen that just

228
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,860
shipped the minute you plugged it in it

229
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,899
deployed nmap on your network did a

230
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,480
complete scan started just capturing

231
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,459
terabytes of video and audio remember

232
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,100
these things don't just capture video

233
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,060
These cameras that are all over the

234
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,740
place they capture audio you might not

235
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,839
know that but they capture audio and

236
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,339
just ships it back so if you went into

237
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,019
this device for example and shut off

238
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,300
audio or video the red light would come

239
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,000
up shut off doesn't matter it's still

240
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,279
capturing audio and video right so

241
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,019
that's kind of this this state of some

242
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,640
of these devices and they're all over

243
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,959
the place right

244
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,300
so some of the other attacks Bots are

245
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,680
prevalent I'm you know I don't get

246
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,779
terribly excited about Bots I mean it's

247
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,120
not like a Slammer or a Melissa virus or

248
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,880
something but it really shows kind of

249
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,680
the intent and what's happening with

250
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,019
these devices so Mirai is kind of like I

251
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:42,600
call it kind of the grandfather of X iot

252
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,060
attacks it's a massive botnet it

253
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,820
basically uses a cable modem a couple

254
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,399
routers some access cameras and there

255
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,200
you go you can go exploit these things

256
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,420
on telnet Port 23 they're all wide open

257
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,360
default credentials uh and you can you

258
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,220
can see the damage that was done on that

259
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,779
thing right then you have things like

260
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,220
quiet exit

261
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,860
so we all understand you can exploit

262
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,360
kind of a 10 year old cve on an X iot

263
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,800
right with a with a critical

264
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,620
vulnerability but this was designed for

265
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,620
x-fill so this targeted you know

266
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,740
printers cameras even Network gear right

267
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,620
for x-fill and I'm going to show that to

268
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,180
you and show you kind of how they did

269
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,720
that uh but this thing you know example

270
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,640
of this thing 18 month dwell time that's

271
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,440
actually pretty short this thing is all

272
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,660
over the place so it's sitting on your

273
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,000
critical devices they take command and

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,160
control they get in just with the

275
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,500
default credential they get into command

276
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,600
and control and now they can go

277
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,060
x-fill anything on Prem up into the

278
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,399
cloud that's what they did here and that

279
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,459
thing's pretty serious as well plcs I'm

280
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,200
going to talk a little bit so these

281
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,420
things are are also very vulnerable

282
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,000
right you don't know where they are you

283
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,180
can't touch them very old software these

284
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,920
things are very old all kinds of problem

285
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
with plcs as well

286
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,240
pipe dream this is ripped from the

287
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,000
headlines the Vulcan files this is a

288
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,560
piece of Russian software that's

289
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,860
specifically targeting plc's oil and gas

290
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,140
critical infrastructure Railways

291
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,519
airports it's pretty pretty nasty right

292
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,839
hospitals and fusion pumps I mean the

293
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,180
list goes on and on right three to five

294
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,240
of these devices you know fifty percent

295
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,560
of them deployed with default

296
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,660
credentials the other half are basically

297
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,519
changed once when provisioned and never

298
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,440
thought about again and the the the

299
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,420
password on those things when they were

300
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,180
Provisions terribly weak right so I'm

301
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,740
going to keep I'm going to kind of speed

302
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,420
up because I want to I want to actually

303
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,899
use the time to talk about the worst

304
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,959
biggest offender of any device is the

305
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,420
camera it's a mess think about these

306
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,540
things they love to be connected uh they

307
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,459
have open ports and protocols every

308
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,800
password's default they're all shipped

309
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,940
out of the box with critical

310
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,040
vulnerabilities these things are an

311
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,779
absolute mess so what I'm going to do

312
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,579
now if I have some time actually just

313
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,019
going to show

314
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,940
how we can hack one of these cameras so

315
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,320
bear with me

316
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,180
because I'm going to do this on my

317
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,760
keyboard and I might screw this up if I

318
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,899
click it's going to go back but I'm

319
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,519
going to try to do this right so we're

320
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,380
going to try to go through this hack and

321
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,440
kind of show you a hack okay so this is

322
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,300
Kali Linux

323
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,040
right and this is the laptop we're going

324
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,440
to use to hack an actual Live security

325
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,320
camera this is Live security camera that

326
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,519
we're going to log into this device

327
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,140
isn't the hack yet we're just logging

328
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,680
into it but just remember right that the

329
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,440
Hat kind of starts here because I can

330
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,300
just go to Google and ask this is a

331
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,980
Hikvision camera what's the default

332
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,200
credentials admin one two three four or

333
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,300
admin one two three four five wow that's

334
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,600
a so you know I can just Google the 12

335
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,399
credential I can log into this and we're

336
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,899
just going to log in we're going to take

337
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,279
a look at what's happening in this

338
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,139
camera once you get into the camera you

339
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,940
can see a couple things right first of

340
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,139
all you can see what is the camera

341
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,720
watching this is a live camera on the

342
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,519
network so we're going to show and watch

343
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,100
so there it is it's it's it's watching a

344
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,019
very secure layer 2 switch on a table

345
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,839
very secure so that's what the cameras

346
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,459
uh watching so we're going to be able to

347
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,139
see that and then we're going to be able

348
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,880
to go in and just take a look at the the

349
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,160
kind of settings the configurations the

350
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,519
gateways the IP address the passwords

351
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,079
and all those kinds of things you see

352
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,240
that all in here right at the end of the

353
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,139
day

354
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,620
this is a Linux server that just happens

355
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,779
to be performing camera functions right

356
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,540
so when you see a camera I see a Linux

357
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,360
server so do the hackers right so there

358
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,220
it is so what we're going to do on here

359
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,380
if I can just go back so we're going to

360
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,839
kind of I I showed you Showdown right so

361
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,399
let's do the first thing a hacker might

362
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,440
do is say all right I want to go up to

363
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,639
Showdown I'm going to just search

364
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,680
Showdown and see how many of these

365
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,139
network accessible Hikvision cameras are

366
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,240
there on the open internet that I can

367
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,339
see it if we do the global search you're

368
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,720
going to see there's about three and a

369
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,820
half million of them in the world right

370
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,139
and you say okay well let's what about

371
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:07,200
the US right so let's just do the us so

372
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,639
we do that there's about a half a

373
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,680
million of these things available right

374
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,680
so so again remember most of these

375
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,540
attacks aren't happening from the open

376
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,060
internet they're going to attack it and

377
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,639
then pivot over to your X iot but still

378
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,320
half a million of these things available

379
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,320
right so that's that's pretty good I see

380
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,420
that then I say okay what about let's go

381
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,040
get an exploit

382
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,779
right so I'm going to try to go up I'm

383
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,720
going to go up to exploit here's exploit

384
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,139
database DB right so again there's a lot

385
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,519
of kind of

386
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,620
um paid places you can get exploits you

387
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,420
can go on the dark web and pay thousands

388
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,339
of dollars for these things there are

389
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,740
public sources of exploits I'm really

390
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,600
cheap so I'm going here this is free

391
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,220
right so I'm going to go up and I'm

392
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,199
going to see so here we go here's the

393
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:53,579
exploit you can see it for this

394
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,560
hickvision camera I'm going to pick that

395
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,380
exploit okay so there's the exploit then

396
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,360
I go in here

397
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,699
there you go there's the exploit right

398
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,639
and here's the code right there right so

399
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,100
I can modify this copy it whatever I

400
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,160
want right so now what I'm going to do

401
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,680
though is I'm going to I'm going to

402
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,920
download this exploit right which is

403
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,720
just a script and I'm going to download

404
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,940
and put it on my

405
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,300
laptop right okay so then when I do that

406
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,860
I'm going to create a directory you're

407
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,240
going to see me I'm going to create this

408
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,180
directory here which is called operation

409
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,519
hickvision or optic vision I'm going to

410
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,899
create that directly I'm going to put

411
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,660
that exploit right on it right so there

412
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,240
it is I'm right there there it is I got

413
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,019
it right so I put that on there right

414
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,339
so now

415
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,399
I'm gonna make this thing executable

416
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,079
I'm going to make that so there it is

417
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,360
there it is so now what I'm going to do

418
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,220
is I've got that on the camera so now

419
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,540
what I want to do is I'm going to do a

420
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,820
check and I'm going to check this Remote

421
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,860
device which happens to be this camera

422
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,380
on Port 80 and I'm going to ask is it

423
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,540
vulnerable to this exploit right so I'm

424
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,459
going to do a check and you're going to

425
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,380
see there it's going to come

426
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,699
right

427
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,040
and so it's verified I'm going to go

428
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
back just a little bit and show you this

429
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,000
see that right there it's verified

430
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,100
exploitable right so I just did a check

431
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,220
and it said verified exploitable perfect

432
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,019
now I know this particular exploit on

433
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,240
this device is exploitable now what I'm

434
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,260
going to do I'm going to change from

435
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,839
check to Shell which is actually going

436
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,240
to execute the code on this device and

437
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,519
here's where the exploit begins to

438
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,300
happen I change it to Shell Bingo there

439
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,320
it is

440
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,600
right so I've got it you can see here

441
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,959
busy box version

442
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,699
12.126.2 2019 is the last time that

443
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,399
thing is updated pretty typical right so

444
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,320
there it is I just exploded this camera

445
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,779
it means I have root privilege on this

446
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,339
device Way Beyond the administrative

447
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,860
control for all intent and purposes we

448
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,019
own this camera right now okay totally

449
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,180
own this camera right so now

450
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,899
what I'm going to do I just verified

451
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,240
that's exploitable okay

452
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,640
so now I'm going to list the directories

453
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,380
in here I'm in this camera I now have

454
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,419
full control if you know Linux this is

455
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:13,980
very Linux like just going to list the

456
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,599
directories then what I'm going to do is

457
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,520
I'm going to create another directory on

458
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,500
here

459
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,900
called bad and you're going to see me

460
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,179
create this directory and I'm going to

461
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,799
highlight it here just to make sure it's

462
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,059
there just want to make sure that

463
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,919
directory is there it's called bad

464
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,660
you're going to see me highlight it okay

465
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,179
so there it is there it is bad zip

466
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,100
directly okay so I just exploited this

467
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,160
camera with the exploit I got I'm now

468
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,440
listing and creating directories that in

469
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,780
itself isn't Earth shattering but we'll

470
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,799
get there right so here I am now let's

471
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,900
kind of do some interesting things here

472
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,160
right so I'm going to clear this out

473
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,320
just to make space so you can see a

474
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,100
little bit better I'm going to

475
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,520
re-execute the Shell okay so there it is

476
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,900
okay so now here I am now let's let's do

477
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,520
something let's let's bring up some

478
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,200
hacker tools and get them on to this

479
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,419
directory right so I want to I want to

480
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,860
get some tools

481
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,840
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

482
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,700
use tftp just to show some other

483
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,700
protocols I mean from tftp I'm going to

484
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,940
do a remote get from this camera I'm

485
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,799
going to go to my laptop and grab a file

486
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,740
file called do dot bad and I'm going to

487
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,740
grab that file from my laptop and I'm

488
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,080
and I'm going to put it here on the

489
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,539
camera okay so I'm going to do that I'm

490
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,760
going to put it on the camera there it

491
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,559
is now what I'm going to do is I'm going

492
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,240
to make this executable I'm going to use

493
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,240
read write 777 so that I make that route

494
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,360
executable there it is there's 777 it's

495
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,860
now executable

496
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,620
and there I go I've got now this file on

497
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,240
here now I could have uploaded anything

498
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,919
I wanted I could have put hacker tools

499
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,559
password crackers you name it anything I

500
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,299
wanted right I could have done anything

501
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,320
I wanted right but in this case I just

502
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,840
brought this video in and here's the do

503
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,460
dot badge so I'm going to let this come

504
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,039
in I made it executable and in this case

505
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,780
I just uploaded a Shrek video I just

506
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,340
wanted to show you I could do anything I

507
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,960
want okay

508
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,559
um

509
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,440
so now let's do something interesting

510
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,480
okay so presumably I have some hacker

511
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,059
tools on here anything I wanted I could

512
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,220
have just piled them on there okay so

513
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,520
now let's X fill right remember that's

514
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,320
the point of these things I take command

515
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,940
and control like an axle so now I can go

516
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,039
to your it assets I can go to your

517
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,360
Exchange Server I can go to your cloud

518
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,700
and I can start X filling data right but

519
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,320
what I want to do here for the sake of

520
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,240
time is let's just look for some

521
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,700
interesting stuff that's sensitive on

522
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,440
this camera and so what I'm going to do

523
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,640
is I'm going to look in the directory

524
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,380
and I'm going to see a pair

525
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,140
right I'm going to see a pair of dot pem

526
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,480
files public Keys private and public

527
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,340
Keys okay so I'm going to find them on

528
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,620
this camera you'll see them here I'm

529
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,900
going to highlight them right so there

530
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,600
they are

531
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,380
servecert.pamservkey.pen a pair of

532
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,200
public and private Keys oftentimes these

533
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,100
can be

534
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,440
um into a single file but in this case

535
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,020
they're bifurcated into two okay so real

536
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,220
quickly what I'm going to do is I'm

537
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,220
going to use SCP okay secure copy

538
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,340
protocol which uses SSH Port 22 I'm

539
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,740
going to exfiltrate these pem files of

540
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,360
which there are two I'm going to

541
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,520
exfiltrate them and I'm going to put

542
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,380
them in the same directory on my laptop

543
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,660
that I had the video that I uploaded

544
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,840
okay so here you go so you see SCP there

545
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,760
you go I'm going to see the files

546
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,880
I'm going to tell them please exfil go

547
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,760
over to my directory on my laptop and

548
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,799
we're going to place those files in the

549
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,240
laptop I'm actually going to see them

550
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,860
there they are there's the two files

551
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,799
serve cert serve key

552
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,500
here it comes

553
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,660
and now

554
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,460
bingo

555
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,919
these files are going to be placed

556
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,679
right over in the same directory right

557
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,020
there where I got the video here's the

558
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,419
do dot bad video there's the two files I

559
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:02,100
could have exfiltrated anything I wanted

560
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,740
it could have been passwords proprietary

561
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,440
information emails your Exchange Server

562
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,419
your Cloud I don't care I could have

563
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,520
done anything I wanted I just showed you

564
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,760
that right so that's kind of uh where we

565
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,380
are on this right I don't have time to

566
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,480
go through the fixes of this come on

567
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,460
over to our booth but we can actually

568
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,880
fix this by talking to these devices

569
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,760
finally doing a profile and them

570
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,679
discovering them and then let's take

571
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,299
care of default passwords and

572
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,280
credentials right it's a big problem if

573
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,500
you're worried about a critical cve and

574
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,600
your passwords are default you're

575
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,580
misplaced go back and fix the password

576
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,919
so we can rotate passwords we can shut

577
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:44,039
off telnet SSH Bluetooth Wi-Fi all these

578
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,960
extraneous ports and protocols we can

579
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,000
upgrade and downgrade firmware and we

580
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,640
can maintain State on these devices so

581
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,559
that we know if they went from a secure

582
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,600
State back down to an insecure State

583
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,159
someone can just go put a paper clip

584
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,140
into these devices I want to be able to

585
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,000
know that there was environmental drift

586
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,919
we can do all that today for the very

587
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,080
first time ever right we can actually

588
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,240
start fixing this stuff because believe

589
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,280
me all the nation states are focused on

590
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,500
it as well as the botnet armies and all

591
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,360
the Cyber criminals just think about

592
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,700
what I just showed you I could have done

593
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,559
a host of things

594
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,840
and I could have had ransomware easily

595
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,299
deployed on that device right so I don't

596
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:23,400
have time for much else I'm way over but

597
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,960
I'll stop there and see if anyone has

598
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,059
any questions and sorry for going over a

599
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,320
couple minutes but I wanted to show you

600
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,140
the hack any any questions or anything

601
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,500
there

602
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,299
cool

603
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,500
awesome well we're over in the I.T

604
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,179
Village it's phosphorus cyber security

605
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:44,100
thanks for joining me today and have a

606
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,120
great rest thank you John

607
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,250
[Applause]
