1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
there we go we're going to talk about

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,479
secrets we're going to talk about what

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,920
the heck they are finding them rotating

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,919
them storing them safely uh it's easy

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,720
all of you are going to rock at this

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,160
it's very simple

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,719
um I would like you to please try this

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,759
at home and work a lot of people are

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,500
like don't try this at home I really

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,960
want you to try this I suspect that all

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,580
of you will successfully find a secret

12
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,680
unless you work at an amazing place that

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,300
I probably would love to work

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,580
um so about me I'm Tanya I'm the head

15
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,160
nerd at we hack purple I do security

16
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,140
Champions secure coding training and

17
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,960
stuff I wrote a book about appsec this

18
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,380
is year 26 for me in Tech I've done a

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,660
bunch of stuff but the key takeaway is

20
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,879
that I am a nerd on the internet who

21
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,440
really likes to talk about securing

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,059
software that's the key take and when I

23
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,160
brush my hair I look very good

24
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,780
um so right now half the audience is

25
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,039
like

26
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,200
everyone knows

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,120
not to put secrets in the code everyone

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,980
knows this already

29
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,420
uh but uh you know you say that but

30
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,640
um you know late 2021 one of my clients

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,719
was like I know you don't pen test

32
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,040
anymore but could you just take a quick

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,500
look we're going to buy this company and

34
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,360
30 minutes in I was like I have their

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,520
banking like their legit banking stuff

36
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,760
for the whole company ah

37
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,439
um so I called the company they fixed it

38
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,580
and then the other company bought them

39
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,040
for less money but so this is still a

40
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,200
giant problem this is still happening

41
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,560
all the time and I was a developer a lot

42
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,439
longer than I worked in security and I

43
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,119
put a lot of secrets in code I have like

44
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,600
a lot of work I need to make up for now

45
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,060
and so yeah um this happens all the time

46
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,000
and so luckily it's super easy to

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,680
actually find the secrets in the code

48
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,860
it's not that hard and so we only have a

49
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,600
you know 22 minutes or so so we're gonna

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,299
go a bit fast bear with me but let's

51
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:49,799
start at the beginning like what the

52
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,720
heck are secrets

53
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,180
um secrets are what computers use to

54
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,560
identify identify each other so when I'm

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,380
like hey I'm an app and I would like to

56
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,000
connect to you database they're like are

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,500
you really the app I should be talking

58
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,920
to I'm like yes I am here you go so we

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,840
have API actually I'll give you a bunch

60
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,760
of examples in a minute

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
but computers don't have eyes they can't

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,080
look at us and be like Oh yeah I

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,120
remember you from last year you're okay

64
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,760
they don't know these things and so

65
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,860
secrets are the way they do that you

66
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,620
know when you go into a bar or you go to

67
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,239
like a governmental organization and

68
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,500
you're trying to do a thing you go to

69
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,480
the hospital whatever they check your ID

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,480
it's similar to that except computers

71
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,340
don't really get to have a cute license

72
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,280
plate or a driver's license Etc and so

73
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,819
examples of Secrets a password or a

74
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,620
connection string which is uh the one

75
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,180
that I used to put in the code all the

76
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,099
time

77
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,680
API Keys tokens hashes connection

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,220
strings anything to say like hey you're

79
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,140
supposed to talk to me here I can prove

80
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,819
it I'm going to show you this

81
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,300
and so finding these in code is bad

82
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,120
because malicious actors can also find

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
them they're really easy to find and

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,379
then they can use them if I was a

85
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,940
terrible human I would have been like

86
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,340
banking credentials awesome I'm gonna

87
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,260
commit robbery but I'm not like that I'm

88
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,060
a security person so I just told them

89
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,220
right away and we rotated that that

90
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,760
night okay so why do we need Secrets

91
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,480
like Secrets authenticate to other

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,459
computers so authentic this is a very

93
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:27,780
beginner talk so if you're like I

94
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,140
already know this Tanya that's okay

95
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,819
authentication is like are you the real

96
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,340
authentic you are you a person that just

97
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,680
looks like my friend Sarah or are you

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,860
actually the real Sarah and so this is

99
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,840
how computers talk to each other so when

100
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,540
an application wants to you know query a

101
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,580
database it sends a connection string

102
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,860
and it's like I want this table I want

103
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,720
these things this is the level of access

104
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm allowed PS here's the password let

105
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,140
me in and so basically

106
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,000
um then the database response sure thing

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,799
here you go and they let you do stuff

108
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,379
and you finish off all the things if

109
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,120
they were smart enough to figure this

110
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,280
out for themselves we wouldn't need

111
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,439
secrets and lots of us wouldn't have

112
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,319
jobs anymore computers are pretty dumb

113
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,239
compared to humans I know they can do

114
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,459
things very quickly but they can only do

115
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,978
it as well as we tell them to do it and

116
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:21,720
so you might be thinking why would

117
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,000
someone do this well as a person that

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
was a developer for 17 years before she

119
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,100
switched to security well I guess I did

120
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,740
security a bit anyway the winners

121
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,720
I would put it in the code in the

122
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,880
comments for the next Dev to help them

123
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,100
this is what we were taught in college I

124
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,840
kid you not I went to college in the 90s

125
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,180
and they're like oh yeah well you know

126
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,979
that's nice that you're writing this app

127
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,199
Tanya but what about when Brad needs to

128
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,419
work on it when you're on vacation Brad

129
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:49,979
needs to know how to contact the

130
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,080
database and Duel of these things we

131
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,120
still have literally like we would have

132
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,040
all the passwords and everything on a

133
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,240
big piece of paper and everyone's

134
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,919
cubicle so that we would know how to

135
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,900
connect we thought we were doing a great

136
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,699
job ensuring we gave more reliable

137
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:03,840
service

138
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,320
things are in the code because we

139
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,960
thought and we were taught to do it that

140
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,720
way now we've had many malicious actors

141
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,400
use those for evil

142
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,520
like I thought I was an awesome Dev my

143
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,960
you know client would call me and be

144
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,340
like I forgot my password I'm like don't

145
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,919
worry I'll look it up for you and then I

146
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,539
just like look it up for them I decrypt

147
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,220
them like here you go it's this thanks

148
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,600
Ann

149
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,180
this is this although it's convenient

150
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,740
and might make it seem like we're doing

151
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,539
better stuff but it turns out that's a

152
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,300
huge security flaw and so he's hanging

153
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,979
his head in shame

154
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,440
um okay and so one thing I want to just

155
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,139
say briefly is that ideally when you're

156
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,380
gonna store a password specifically so

157
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,360
when we have secrets we'll do all sorts

158
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,380
of things with them but when you're

159
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,259
storing a user password this is not a

160
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,180
secret is different than a secret it's

161
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,400
for humans it's not for computers we

162
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,320
treat it differently and I mentioned

163
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,699
this because I showed this to someone

164
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,320
else and they're like but what about my

165
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,199
users passwords those aren't secrets and

166
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,120
you want to take them you want to Salt

167
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,780
them which means add a long unique value

168
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,320
to the front of it then you encrypt the

169
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,840
whole thing or then you hash the whole

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,120
thing which is a one-way crypto

171
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,720
cryptographic uh action so you can never

172
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,460
get it back and then you store that in

173
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,800
the database I used to encrypt them

174
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,199
encryption means you can get it back we

175
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,840
don't want it back which sounds kind of

176
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,060
weird right but what you do is you get

177
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,000
the value from the user you add on the

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
salt you do the hashing and then you

179
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,419
just compare to what you have in the

180
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,340
database what this means is that if

181
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,699
someday your application gets breached

182
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,919
uh all of that stuff's completely

183
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,500
useless to malicious actors so you might

184
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,620
be in have ibimponed.com you might

185
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,940
receive an email saying it's been

186
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,039
breached but the actual malicious actors

187
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,080
they they can't use a rainbow table they

188
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,580
can't get that value back because it's

189
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,160
salted and tashed but that's not a

190
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,220
secret that is a user's a user's

191
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,080
password it's not the same secrets are

192
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,180
just for computers okay so what is the

193
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,080
risk

194
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,900
secrets in our code can have all sorts

195
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,699
of potential attacks breaches

196
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,100
embarrassment malicious actors can use

197
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,699
these secrets to talk to your computers

198
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:23,099
with all the authority that that secret

199
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,160
holds so just like when I found the

200
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,199
banking passwords if I was an evil

201
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,440
stealer type of robbery person I would

202
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,580
go commit theft I'm not awesome

203
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,880
um but if you get an API secret you can

204
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,099
then talk to apis you shouldn't be

205
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,960
allowed to if you're a malicious actor

206
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,060
if you get a connection string you can

207
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,919
connect to that database and copy the

208
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,400
data change the data erase all of the

209
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,139
data there's a whole bunch of things

210
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,180
that you can do and so basically all of

211
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,620
the things that you've been trying to

212
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,259
protect are no longer protected if

213
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,599
someone can get those secrets and so

214
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,240
none of the outcomes are good from this

215
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,639
error unfortunately so what what can we

216
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,960
do about it

217
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,919
we find the secrets we rotate them and

218
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,599
then from then on we use a secret

219
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,000
management tool

220
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,599
to manage them for us it's way better

221
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,520
um so if we put all of this stuff

222
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,039
as we find them we change the secret

223
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,599
which I'm going to explain why in a

224
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,699
minute and then we stick in our secret

225
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,760
management tool and we access it

226
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,140
programmatically from then on so that

227
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,120
means in your CI CD it can say oh

228
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,320
there's supposed to be a secret there

229
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,240
cool I'm going to go talk to the Vault

230
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,640
I'm going to authenticate to it I'm

231
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,679
going to grab that thing and now I can

232
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,600
put in the password or connection string

233
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,180
or whatever the thing is as I'm testing

234
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,339
and building your code awesome

235
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,100
you can also access it programmatically

236
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,320
from within your application it's great

237
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,600
human beings don't have to manage this I

238
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,519
don't know about you but I don't want to

239
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,040
manage Secrets it's boring and hard work

240
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,820
okay so yay high fives

241
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,540
um so the hunt begins so we want to go

242
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,380
and find some secrets so how do we hunt

243
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,720
this might sound really simplified and

244
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,399
that's because it's actually really

245
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,140
really easy I remember thinking this

246
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,760
seemed really hard and then the first

247
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,080
time I went to do it I was like pop pop

248
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,300
pop pop I found tons of stuff and I was

249
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,459
like I feel very smart

250
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,160
so you download a copy of your code so

251
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,080
if you use GitHub bitbucket whatever

252
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,660
you're using I just download the whole

253
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,600
thing and then I scan it with a secret

254
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,399
scanner there's tons of free ones I'm

255
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,380
going to give you a giant list

256
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,120
and then you sift through the results

257
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,519
the boring stuff so I actually suggest

258
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,920
that you put on music get like some

259
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,560
caffeine get a snack get like a comfy

260
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,060
chair and get ready because you're going

261
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,100
to spend a few hours going through these

262
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,279
results okay so I apologize if you

263
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,140
thought oh she's gonna have a sword

264
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,600
she's gonna

265
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,860
like she's gonna have spirits and guns

266
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,720
and she's gonna hunt things it may seem

267
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,880
kind of anticlimactic because it's

268
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,920
actually so easy compared to all the

269
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,080
other appsec activities I would say this

270
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,779
is by far the easiest one and if you are

271
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,820
junior or new to appsec or you're going

272
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,040
to hire an intern or you're going to try

273
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,600
to train someone up this is a really

274
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,000
good activity that can make them feel

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,720
useful right away and give value right

276
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
away and not discourage them because

277
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,620
there are some app Tech activities that

278
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,920
are really hard this is not one of them

279
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,959
so how these tools work

280
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,880
so they use something called regular

281
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,040
Expressions who here has written a

282
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,660
regular expression before

283
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,040
yeah

284
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,839
yeah like the first time you write one

285
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,459
you're like oh it's kind of weird but as

286
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,560
soon as you start writing them it's

287
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,959
actually really quite easy and so when

288
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,300
you like use a regular expression what

289
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,940
it does is you write out a pattern and

290
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,279
it matches it throughout your entire

291
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,579
application or all of your coats all

292
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:02,459
oops sorry I'll go into a folder where

293
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,320
all the code is and then you run the

294
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,300
secret scanner it's just doing regex

295
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,579
against the whole thing regex is short

296
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,740
form for regular expression

297
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,760
they also search for entropy so entropy

298
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,640
in this case means super long random

299
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,800
stuff so people are supposed to name

300
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,980
their variables things like

301
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,440
um username

302
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,920
because it's a username

303
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,779
password because it's a password you

304
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,399
usually name the thing after what it is

305
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,100
sometimes you'll add like Str at the end

306
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,079
or at the beginning to say it's a string

307
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,700
and that's helpful

308
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,980
if you see a big long thing that's like

309
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,260
45 characters and it's all just random

310
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,360
there's no real words there's numbers

311
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,980
there's uppercase there's lowercase

312
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,399
that's probably a secret it's probably

313
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,860
not a variable name and it is a if it is

314
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,279
a variable name you are an unpopular

315
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:58,620
developer at your office because it's

316
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,360
really hard to tell what you're doing

317
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,339
with that and so it looks for all these

318
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:03,899
long random things and they're almost

319
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,899
always a secret

320
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,220
keywords it also looks for those like

321
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,680
password key API key connection string

322
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,440
Etc if it says that it's probably a

323
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,820
secret

324
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,620
um it's not exactly rocket science so

325
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,360
again you might be like oh this talks so

326
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,339
easy yes I wanted to write a talk that

327
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,380
anyone could understand I want to write

328
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,339
a talk

329
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,920
that would give you all the confidence

330
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,320
to go and try to do this because if you

331
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,880
are just starting or especially if

332
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,100
you're at a new office and they're like

333
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,660
read these documents you don't really

334
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,279
have access to anything if you have read

335
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,980
access only to the code repository and

336
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,440
you have no tools yet no permissions go

337
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,940
find a whole bunch of Secrets and you

338
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,620
just earned your paycheck

339
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,779
so this is a giant list of secret

340
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,320
scanners and all of them are free except

341
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,500
cred scan from Microsoft and although I

342
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,779
think credscan is quite Nifty I'd

343
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,940
probably go with one of the 20 free ones

344
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,160
on the page instead if you are looking

345
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,560
for a secret scanner like all of these

346
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,200
are decent I really like truffle hog but

347
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,019
mostly because I've used it the most and

348
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,300
so any of these will go through and look

349
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,000
for stuff Chekov specifically which is

350
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,940
on the right side third from the top it

351
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,740
looks at infrastructure as code we don't

352
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,320
want Secrets there either infrastructure

353
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,660
is code regular app code does not matter

354
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,760
I don't want secrets in there

355
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,579
okay so next false positives kind of

356
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:28,980
suck but you're gonna get some

357
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,380
unfortunately so I have a fun little

358
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,839
story about this so I was coaching a

359
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,220
person to become an abstract

360
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,160
professional and I was like we should do

361
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,959
this on your first week this will be

362
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:42,300
really easy and I remember he'd never

363
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,980
written code before in his whole life

364
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,760
and basically we we went through and we

365
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,800
found thank you we went through and we

366
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,740
found a whole bunch of Secrets

367
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,740
but one of them was a male license key

368
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,160
and there's this weird email converging

369
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,560
software or whatever and we found out uh

370
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,700
that that company went out of business

371
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,800
10 years ago and so although it was a

372
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,660
license key and normally it would be a

373
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,560
secret

374
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,420
uh we found out we weren't breaking any

375
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,100
copyright and they were using it all

376
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,839
over the company and we decided it

377
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,760
wasn't a secret anymore and so we

378
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,180
suppressed those from then on and so

379
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,940
sometimes you're going to find poor

380
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,240
coding choices that aren't quite a

381
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,760
violation of the secret but basically

382
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,240
you should go through and at first tutor

383
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,380
the person and just say if you're not

384
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,720
sure just come and get me okay I have

385
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,880
work to do I'll come see you in an hour

386
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,320
and then just check on them every now

387
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,300
and again and encourage them

388
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,040
um you might also find some scary things

389
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,560
I have found some passwords to things

390
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,660
that are quite important to the company

391
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,820
I was working for where I was pretty

392
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,000
darn shocked it was in the code I bet a

393
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,320
whole bunch of people in this audience

394
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,360
and in this entire building have found

395
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,800
tons

396
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,220
okay so why are interns awesome I am

397
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,139
from Canada you might have noticed my

398
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,540
accent where I ended a sentence at some

399
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,060
point and said a at the end which means

400
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,620
that was a question and the only

401
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,680
appropriate answer is yeah

402
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,440
um so in Canada we pay interns I know

403
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
that that might not be true everywhere

404
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
in the world but we pay them and you can

405
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,060
teach a total Noob and by that I mean an

406
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,980
intern a co-op student whatever you call

407
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,680
them to do this in about an hour you can

408
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,540
have them going and you their first week

409
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,459
you can just make them do this most the

410
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,560
time when you don't have time for them

411
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,139
they might not get it perfect at the

412
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,820
beginning but very very quickly they

413
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,920
will find a whole bunch of things and if

414
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,220
they just find one secret they just

415
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,500
saved you running your entire incident

416
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,079
response process right like you go

417
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,000
through oh and also when you find a

418
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,800
secret go check to see if you're the

419
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,899
second person and not the first person

420
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,440
to notice this so assume breach and go

421
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,300
and like see if anyone else has done

422
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,360
this before okay so tip so someone else

423
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,459
gave a talk about this yesterday A Plus

424
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,339
to that person you can commit or you can

425
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,639
create a pre-commit hook that will then

426
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,560
um block new secrets from ever being

427
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,019
checked in again so whenever a Dev goes

428
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:15,120
to check something in they just do the

429
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,680
regex very quickly and they're like that

430
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,139
looks like a secret no sir you need to

431
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,240
like try again later

432
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,779
okay so rotating secrets if you spill a

433
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,579
secret so that means you put in the code

434
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,139
or somewhere you weren't supposed to you

435
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:31,380
rotate it no ifs ands or buts

436
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,620
um I have this friend that does a live

437
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,120
streaming all the time her name sues

438
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,699
Hinton she's pretty amazing if you like

439
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,920
smart things in programming them she's

440
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,860
awesome and she spilled a secret Walsh

441
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,660
was live streaming once and then she

442
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,279
showed everyone how to rotate it she's

443
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,420
like yeah that's right in two minutes

444
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,980
you could just rotate it and check it

445
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,680
back in and so he's like you rock sues

446
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,740
so you if it gets billed you have to

447
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,540
rotate it you do not take that spilled

448
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,560
secret and put it in your secret

449
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,060
management tool you've just wasted all

450
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,120
your time so if you app so you must

451
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,819
rotate it do not check it into the

452
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,380
secret management tool and pretend

453
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,359
everything is fine because like I said

454
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,859
you're probably not the first person to

455
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,839
find it so how do you rotate a secret

456
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,179
you literally just generate a new one

457
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,000
you just say change my password that's

458
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,799
it you just generate a new one so if

459
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,480
it's an API key you just literally press

460
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,160
the little refresh button it makes you a

461
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,079
new one if it's a password you do the

462
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,880
change my password and just make a new

463
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,179
one it doesn't matter what the secret is

464
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,940
you must rotate it which means make a

465
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,860
new one and check the new one into the

466
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,260
code repository okay so setting up a

467
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,419
secret management tool

468
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,760
um so unfortunately none of them are

469
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,520
free all of them cost money I didn't

470
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,280
find a single one that was free lots of

471
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,440
these are cool I've used two or three of

472
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,260
them not all of them some of them are

473
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,539
really expensive and it makes me think

474
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,100
that I'm in the wrong business when I

475
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,340
see how much my clients pay for these

476
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,080
but here are a whole bunch of them I

477
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,760
don't recommend specific ones I just

478
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,700
recommend that you get one of them

479
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,460
so your entire org should use the same

480
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,460
tool but you should have separate volts

481
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,580
so each system so each like application

482
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,520
should have its own Vault because if

483
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,620
somehow someone gets into your secret

484
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,020
management tool if it was all just in

485
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,539
the same Vault they would get access to

486
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,280
all of your applications and life would

487
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,600
be terrible so each so same product or

488
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,059
system or whatever for everyone separate

489
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,299
vaults for each system you built that's

490
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:39,360
really important yay Hearts okay so

491
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,820
secret management uh the musical wait no

492
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,320
sorry best practices I get those

493
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,559
confused okay so each application should

494
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,320
have its own Vault back up the Vault

495
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,539
like your livelihood depends on it

496
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,539
because it does use a service account

497
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:58,200
for Access not your personal employee

498
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,480
account so not t Jenga you want to have

499
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,940
whatever the name of the app is connect

500
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,100
it to your CI CD for each different

501
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,559
environment and never save a copy

502
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,600
somewhere else of that secret I've seen

503
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,640
so many devs be like oh yeah but I also

504
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,160
stored it in this folder I'm like ah

505
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,080
please don't do that

506
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,400
um if you find a secret somewhere it

507
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,900
shouldn't be and it's an important

508
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,600
secret kick off the incident response

509
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,940
process because like I said before I'm

510
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,500
seeing it for the third time because I

511
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
really hope you do that conclusion what

512
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,080
we learned very quickly What secrets are

513
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,840
why we must protect them how to find

514
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,419
secrets and then rotate the secrets how

515
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:39,480
to manage them safely how to prevent

516
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,700
secrets from getting into your code and

517
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,679
what is up next in the four minutes I

518
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,260
have remaining are some resources I

519
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,940
always give resources at the end and the

520
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,620
first one is would you like to have my

521
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,140
slides this link will also be on the

522
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,600
very end of the like last slide where I

523
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,100
answer questions but just so you know

524
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,260
PDF summary

525
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,179
I have an online community called we

526
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,100
hack purple and every single thing

527
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,380
inside of it is free and we have

528
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,360
community members present and teach

529
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,760
stuff to each other all the time and

530
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,360
earlier this month I had the OAS prong

531
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,940
Secrets project team come and like just

532
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,500
do like this two-hour Workshop where we

533
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,419
all smashed and we found secrets and it

534
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,820
was awesome and so if you want to

535
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,919
practice finding Secrets not at work so

536
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,660
you look super cool before you go to

537
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,539
work they the the wonderful humans from

538
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,000
OAS again have created an amazing free

539
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,700
tool also there's a video on my YouTube

540
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,400
channel we hack purple where you can see

541
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,320
them even though you missed it like we

542
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,660
still have a recording and it was great

543
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,760
the books are not free all of these

544
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,620
books are about devops except the last

545
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,080
one which I wrote is about appsec and me

546
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,080
and my mom agree it's pretty good and

547
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,559
lastly I have a podcast called we hack

548
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,120
purple podcast I know you're not very

549
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,980
surprised where I just talk with people

550
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,200
about appsec and it's just casual

551
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,480
conversations where I get to ask really

552
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,460
smart people all the questions I ever

553
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,919
wanted to if I had known earlier in my

554
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,299
career that I could just start a podcast

555
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,280
and then invite every person that I

556
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,440
admire to come on it they would say yes

557
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,179
I would have done this years ago it's

558
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:15,419
it's the podcasting host secret and then

559
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,640
the last resource is me I am a nerd on

560
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,280
the internet I make videos I tweet I do

561
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,200
all sorts of stuff I am in all the

562
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,360
places if you look up she hacks purple

563
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,880
that will probably be me except I have

564
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,799
an imposter at she hexpurple.dev so

565
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,299
don't go there

566
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:33,059
um yeah I I will never try to sell you

567
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,659
online gambling FYI uh but with that I

568
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,640
want to thank everyone for coming today

569
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,679
I want to thank especially all the

570
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:42,720
volunteers that made this conference

571
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,280
happen and I'm hoping that all of you

572
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,960
could just join me and clap for them

573
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,820
because they worked for months for this

574
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,419
thank you to the volunteers

575
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,460
yeah

576
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,080
sometimes people forget them because

577
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,580
they're not the ones on stage but

578
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,679
without them I would not be here

579
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,720
does anyone have any questions do I have

580
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,640
one or two minutes for a question okay

581
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,780
I see you

582
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,539
I see you Pablo

583
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,640
um I'm picturing the secret involved and

584
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,679
I'll take a bank involved there's a big

585
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,380
key in the front individual issues for

586
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,020
their own little fake Hot Pocket

587
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,320
how do you deal with the 15 questions

588
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,480
okay so the question is how so I'm going

589
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,419
to reword it how do you authenticate to

590
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,100
the Vault right because that's the most

591
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,360
important part because then you get all

592
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,820
the secrets and generally you use what's

593
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,039
called a service account so rather than

594
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,260
the Tanya tijanka account like when I

595
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,480
log in there's a service account for

596
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,520
that system that's specifically for that

597
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,500
Vault and it's a an identity on the

598
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,020
network and generally you monitor them

599
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,820
like crazy because they should never be

600
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,559
doing weird things like sending emails

601
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:52,080
and so the system account

602
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,000
just or the service account for that

603
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,159
system just authenticates to that

604
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,000
authenticates to the um

605
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,799
like to the database and other things on

606
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,480
behalf for you and so that's how you

607
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,179
would get in usually sometimes they have

608
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,679
a secret for the secret vote I don't

609
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,000
like that as much

610
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,700
because then I have to manage it boo

611
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,980
thank you

612
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,320
oh also one thing I should add to that

613
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,900
is if you use a static and net losses

614
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,700
tool they'll also find all the secrets

615
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,919
for you this is an easier step and then

616
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,659
you can build your way up to using stack

617
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,039
analysis and find all sorts of

618
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,020
vulnerabilities not just this but if you

619
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,820
have a SAS tool it should be finding

620
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,059
your secrets as well

621
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:35,220
and I think that's it oh wait no no

622
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,059
sorry there's one there

623
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,520
okay so super awesome question so what

624
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,500
if the dev commits their code there's a

625
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,940
secret in they're like oh my gosh I

626
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,200
shouldn't have done that they just

627
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
removed the secret and then recommit and

628
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,299
they're like I'm cool now and if they

629
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,580
rotated the secret and then checked it

630
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,059
into secret management they are cool but

631
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,679
chances are that's not what they did and

632
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,179
they might be like covering their tracks

633
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,980
a little bit and so there's a few things

634
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,260
you can do so one thing is doing the

635
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,200
pre-commit hook so before it's committed

636
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,020
to the code it does a regex to look to

637
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,580
see if there's a secret in there that

638
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,740
usually catches most of them right when

639
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,020
I worked at Microsoft I got to meet the

640
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,240
incident response team that way because

641
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,280
I was making an intentionally vulnerable

642
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,100
demo and it caught me and then I like it

643
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,380
forced it into prod anyway and then

644
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,159
Azure told on me to my boss and then my

645
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,960
boss didn't do anything until after 30

646
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,059
minutes Azure decided to inform the IR

647
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,760
team and I got to have them wake up in

648
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,020
the middle of the night and that's not

649
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,640
the best way to meet the incident

650
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,620
responders it took me a long time to

651
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,480
make them my friends I was like I'm

652
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,580
really sorry and so that's one thing you

653
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,200
could do another thing you could do is

654
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,380
like look through all that history

655
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,760
ideally though

656
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,500
um you should be stopping things so

657
