1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,460
everyone let's give it up for our two

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,020
presenters to wrap up the evening

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,940
uh hello everyone my name is Eric this

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,920
is Brandon helped to introduce things

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,119
yeah uh welcome to scalable security how

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,660
to win friends and not burn out everyone

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,100
uh so as I said I'm Eric this is Brandon

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,019
uh we work in the Privacy Safety and

9
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,660
Security Org at Google

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,239
um so that's a really big org that

11
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:34,860
doesn't really mean any much I work on

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,719
like internal firewall management and

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,520
you do fun stuff with like Hardware

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,700
security and device attestation fun

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,940
stuff

16
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,620
um but yeah like I think one thing that

17
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,860
we feel and that maybe hopefully some of

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,180
you do is that like we're not really on

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,039
the red team or The Blue Team or the

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,719
purple team or the orange team or

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,520
whatever color you've you know picked

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,039
today uh we're on that team that kind of

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,920
just gets given security problems and

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,960
then is like hi could you please go fix

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,799
that

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,360
um and then we were really lucky because

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,520
we work at a really big organization so

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,320
they're like can you go fix this for

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,360
hundreds of thousands of people

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,400
um and then can you do this again oh and

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,580
again and again and again and

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,159
um over the last five years you're

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,259
almost at seven which is insane

34
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,100
um we've done this a bunch uh we've had

35
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,979
some mixed success but that's okay

36
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,540
um and we've only burnt out a few times

37
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,840
and are always in kind of a constant

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,280
state of either burnt out or not burnt

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,700
out but that's okay

40
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,079
yeah anyway so this talk is going to be

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,880
about some lessons we've learned burning

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,579
out and trying to deploy controls

43
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,259
um and we're gonna be all confident and

44
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,820
be like yeah this is how you don't do

45
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,799
this

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,979
uh so yeah the agenda today is first

47
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,420
we're going to kind of talk about what

48
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,820
we mean by scale I recognize that's a

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,380
buzzword but hopefully that's why you're

50
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,360
all here it's because buzzwords

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,759
um and then we'll talk through some

52
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,500
general themes we think that are

53
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,360
important when you're doing this kind of

54
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,280
grunt work of like you know take out

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,258
control roll it out and try to not piss

56
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,480
off as many people as possible so we're

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
going to talk about measurement and good

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,099
controls and bad controls and being

59
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,599
proactive and not reactive and

60
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,520
communication and all this is going to

61
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,319
get repeated so it's not worth you know

62
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,440
going again anyway Brandon uh what I

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,000
actually mean by security at scale

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,420
Google is a big company we have hundreds

65
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,680
of thousands hundreds of thousands of

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,360
employees

67
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,000
billions of users dozens of chat apps

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,680
and the company has grown incredibly

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,640
quickly

70
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,800
in software engineering at Google we

71
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,200
don't think about can you scale your

72
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,780
product by 2x or 3x we think can you

73
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,000
scale it 10x or 100x

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,440
and that's what we mean by scale in this

75
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,620
talk

76
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,640
this presentation is about how scale

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,220
applies specifically to security

78
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,160
could your team handle 10x more work if

79
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,080
you review every feature before it

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,360
launches or every SAS app before it's

81
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,500
deployed to your company could you

82
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,239
handle 10x more of those

83
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,099
if you have to manually process every

84
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,500
vulnerability on one platform could you

85
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,659
handle four more of them

86
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,940
if users reach out to you every time you

87
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,459
break them and they can't do their work

88
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,260
could you handle having 10x more

89
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,459
employees

90
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,260
we once ran a remediation we're getting

91
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,480
hundreds of tickets a day with users

92
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,400
requesting exceptions and that was a

93
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,080
good remediation

94
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,959
these problems aren't unique to security

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,280
every team at Google has these problems

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
this slide deck had to be reviewed by a

97
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,599
PR team that has to review every slide

98
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,619
deck ever presented

99
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,860
if your workload increases with the

100
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,599
number of users you have the number of

101
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,400
devices in your organization the number

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,140
of vulnerabilities that are discovered

103
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,060
you won't be able to keep up without

104
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,560
burning out

105
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,420
you cannot work harder to keep up with

106
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,760
scale your team cannot hire fast enough

107
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,319
to keep up with scale

108
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,540
if you try to be a hero you will burn

109
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,159
out

110
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,140
your team cannot adapt to scale by

111
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,159
itself

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,659
it turns out talking to people is

113
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,879
actually really important and as an

114
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,860
organization scales your job quickly

115
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,480
becomes convincing other people to do

116
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,978
security not actually doing security

117
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,399
yourself

118
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,320
everything in this presentation is going

119
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,419
to seem super obvious and we understand

120
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,680
that

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,320
um but actually doing these things

122
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,000
consistently and well is much harder

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,320
than it seems

124
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,540
so we're going to talk about

125
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,199
measurements

126
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,940
controls

127
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,400
being proactive versus reactive and

128
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,840
strategies for communicating with your

129
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,138
users

130
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,960
um and again to just reiterate the like

131
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,580
talking about simple things rather than

132
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,040
complicated things I don't know what my

133
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,780
idea of what like a security engineer

134
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,680
did before I got this job but afterwards

135
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,720
it's definitely like doing Excel

136
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,540
spreadsheets and you know writing SQL

137
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,479
queries measurement actually turns out

138
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,120
to be a big part of basically all we do

139
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,340
is like figuring out how bad this is

140
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,720
going to be or how much we're going to

141
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,880
you know mess up people's days

142
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,460
um so it's well again it seems super

143
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,440
simple the amount of times we've had

144
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,880
people just come to us and not be able

145
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,120
to answer these questions means is you

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,560
know begs repeating

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,620
and one second because I can't see

148
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,960
whatever all right so before you begin

149
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,840
you know on your security Journey

150
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,840
um you should be able to answer very

151
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,960
basic questions like what is the size of

152
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,660
your problem if you have some app that

153
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,699
is malicious and being installed on your

154
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,979
devices have you do you know how many

155
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,100
devices it's installed on is it two is

156
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,080
it 500

157
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,580
um if you're looking to turn down a

158
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,680
feature because it's insecure how many

159
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,900
people use this in the last 90 days I've

160
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,400
been in a million meetings where people

161
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,680
are talking past each other where one

162
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,419
query would have just solved that

163
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,240
problem immediately

164
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,919
um and then of course once you have that

165
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,740
data you it's never enough to just get

166
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,080
the initial value you have to go deeper

167
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,100
so you know is 300 a big number in your

168
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,919
organization uh for us it might not be

169
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,160
or it might right and then finally like

170
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,500
are you impacting a single team or a

171
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,000
role right when we're doing analysis

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,160
we're never just thinking like how what

173
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,500
is the number right it's oh is this

174
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,740
number all from one team is it from you

175
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,780
know a particular product that

176
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,120
somebody's working on answering these

177
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,560
questions will let you know like can you

178
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,240
just go talk to that one team and solve

179
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,680
the problem or is this something where

180
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,060
you're going to have to involve lots and

181
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,560
lots of people

182
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,960
and then finally you're just going to

183
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,180
hit limits at some point um at some I

184
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,680
don't forget when this was but we were

185
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,780
working with somebody who was giving a

186
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,880
presentation to us and said look I know

187
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,460
that this impacts somewhere between 10

188
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,440
000 people at the company and 200 000

189
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,720
and I know that that's a big range but

190
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,220
at least it's a range and Elites it

191
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,780
somewhere you can go and then finally

192
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,699
like you're just not going to have data

193
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,100
at some point and that's okay uh we had

194
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,600
plenty of scenarios where you're giving

195
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,060
it you know thing to a VP and you're

196
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,580
like hi I I need a little bit more time

197
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,199
to get better data to figure out how

198
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,460
many people were going to break and the

199
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,500
VP is like look just break them we'll

200
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,020
figure it out later and that's also

201
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,198
happens

202
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,220
um and then there's a shocking amount of

203
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,800
actual engineering work that goes into

204
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,840
getting this data I have written

205
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,840
controls that have never been deployed

206
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,180
anywhere in any enforcing mode but we

207
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,000
write them in in audit mode to see you

208
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,580
know if we deployed this and tried to

209
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,860
turn up the pain like how many people

210
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,259
would actually come getting mad at us

211
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,220
and that is really informative because

212
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,960
it it puts you in the firing line

213
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,460
without actually putting you in the

214
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,340
firing line and then we do not roll out

215
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,160
controls all at once right you take one

216
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,660
percent of the company you roll it out

217
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,340
two percent ten percent so on and so

218
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,039
forth and this is great because it gives

219
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,780
you a little period where the size is

220
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,819
actually manageable where you can go

221
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,620
talk to every person that you might be

222
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,759
impacting

223
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,979
and then a little trick we've learned is

224
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,020
uh if you just change the defaults you'd

225
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,180
be surprised so if you know you're a

226
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,160
company and you're hiring a lot or if

227
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,860
you're rotating uh like Hardware

228
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,020
um if you just flip the default for a

229
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,340
particular control

230
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,560
and just don't tell anyone or you know

231
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,900
tell people but whatever

232
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,700
if you wait a couple years you might get

233
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,979
80 compliance

234
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,140
um so don't do the hard things before

235
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,839
you do the easy things definitely

236
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,299
and speaking of good controls or Brandon

237
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,899
more importantly

238
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
bad controls

239
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,860
this is a bad control uh telling users

240
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,959
not to click on suspicious links doesn't

241
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:55,560
work uh but what is a good control it

242
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,839
may seem obvious but having a structured

243
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,240
way to evaluate what is actually a good

244
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,920
control in your organization will help

245
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,079
you inadvertently deploy bad controls

246
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,459
so what makes a good control

247
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,620
you can not rely on your users to do the

248
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,580
right thing

249
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,320
telling users don't click on suspicious

250
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,180
links doesn't work your users don't know

251
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,680
what suspicious links are

252
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,200
telling users having a security policy

253
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,260
that tells users not to use unapproved

254
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,360
vpns doesn't work your users don't know

255
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,980
what the definition of an unapproved VPN

256
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,880
is

257
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,980
and to that point if your users can

258
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,779
install unimproved vpns in the first

259
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,240
place what are you even doing if you

260
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,279
actually care about something enforce on

261
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,920
it don't shift the blame or the burden

262
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,500
to the users

263
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,899
if deploying a new control requires

264
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,060
talking to everyone it impacts

265
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,160
you won't be able to keep up

266
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,839
spend the time up front to develop

267
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,060
documentation and tools to help users

268
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,160
migrate themselves

269
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,140
and security controls inevitably

270
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,640
increase over time

271
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,560
in site reliability engineering they

272
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,839
have a concept of an error budget where

273
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,760
they predetermine how much pain they're

274
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,320
willing to inflict on users before they

275
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,420
take action consider having a control

276
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,620
budget

277
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,060
how much friction are you willing to

278
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,680
cause to your users for you have to

279
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,080
change something

280
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,760
for example if your team is going to

281
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,440
deploy yet another agent onto the

282
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,880
platforms how does this impact

283
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,440
performance

284
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,480
and is there another agent you can get

285
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,060
rid of instead

286
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,040
be wary of controls that have to be

287
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,740
updated every time software changes

288
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,000
examples of this are kernel extensions

289
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,880
SC Linux policies application allow

290
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,839
lists

291
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,940
the ecosystem moves faster than you can

292
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,160
update these policies

293
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,279
and when you introduce new controls

294
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,720
eventually your team will have more

295
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,459
controls it can maintain

296
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,100
so be willing to turn down controls some

297
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,240
of them probably don't really matter

298
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,980
that much

299
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,420
consider using controls that are

300
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,800
integrated into the platforms you're

301
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,440
securing instead of buying controls from

302
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,200
vendors or building tools yourself

303
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,459
and if you can't do either of those

304
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,620
things find another team that's in a

305
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,760
better position to maintain these

306
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,500
controls like your it team

307
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,360
and just for the last slide like I think

308
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,920
we've ripped out more controls from

309
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,079
Google than we've ever written so just

310
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,700
to give you a sense of like the scale of

311
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,800
that problem for us at least

312
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,779
um inside of Google we have this motto

313
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,180
that goes around it's from like OG you

314
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,700
know Aurora error Google

315
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,100
um but it's secure by default insecure

316
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,720
by exception

317
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,700
um and I actually really like this

318
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,740
because it packs up really quite a lot

319
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,079
into just six words so we're gonna go

320
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,339
through it and

321
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,380
I think the first part right secure by

322
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,420
default if you're going to do something

323
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,680
at a company

324
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,540
like let's say you're going to deploy

325
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,920
something to production or you're going

326
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,140
to share some information with a user or

327
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,940
a customer

328
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,459
if you search the wiki and you get an

329
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,380
answer that is the top answer and says

330
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,839
do it this way that had better be secure

331
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,860
and if you're not working on securing

332
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,079
those well-lit paths you're doing it

333
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,440
wrong right those should always be the

334
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,360
safest way to do something the easiest

335
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,700
way should be the safest way

336
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,339
but inevitably

337
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,440
your controls will just break at some

338
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,440
point or to the point where a user is

339
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,880
going to need to do something to do

340
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,860
their job where the control blocks them

341
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,760
and you still need to do your job right

342
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,260
and this is where we get into this idea

343
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,540
of exceptions

344
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,720
so exceptions at Google are actual

345
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,700
things that are always built into every

346
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,040
control we have so the idea being that

347
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,620
if we Implement a control we always have

348
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,540
a mechanism to turn it off for a

349
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,240
particular set of use cases

350
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,399
these are not just like an email thread

351
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,560
from a security engineer that you then

352
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,480
quote later on these are going to be

353
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,220
tracked in group management systems

354
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,899
somewhere we have an idea of when they

355
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,480
expire we also kind of know what the

356
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,940
justification for that exception was so

357
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,040
when we Implement a control we might

358
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,899
have a bug and a lot of people will need

359
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,420
to get Exempted we will track that so

360
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,519
when we fix the bug we can actually go

361
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,980
back to those people and and fix it up

362
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,220
and again like when we're rolling out

363
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,139
controls we try to hand out exceptions

364
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:16,500
like candy right like if you are

365
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,700
implementing control and you know

366
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,860
somebody will be blocked by it it's an

367
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,360
expectation that you're just gonna give

368
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
it to them ahead of time and then clean

369
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,600
it up later

370
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,639
um so always again trying to think user

371
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,940
first about these kind of things

372
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,100
um but there are some anti-patterns with

373
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,120
this

374
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,160
um this is a slide uh from France

375
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,100
actually and these little I don't think

376
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,380
the things actually have a name but

377
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,880
these little metal things on the

378
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,440
concrete are basically to stop people

379
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,320
from either sleeping on it or sitting on

380
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
it if you've you know lived in San

381
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,100
Francisco even five seconds you've

382
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,300
probably seen stuff like this around

383
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,760
this has a general term called hostile

384
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,100
architecture hostile architecture is

385
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,600
architecture that serves no purpose

386
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,120
other than to discourage something so

387
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,820
it's not for Value it's just again the

388
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,920
value comes from preventing someone from

389
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,360
doing something

390
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,399
I've seen a lot of teams so exceptions

391
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,779
in general feel bad because you're

392
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:11,279
turning off a control it feels like a

393
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,040
security risk and it is but I've seen a

394
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,860
lot of teams effectively give users

395
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,740
grief when they come asking for a

396
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,920
security exception to do their job and

397
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,839
it's very important just for mentally

398
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:25,920
when you're thinking about this

399
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,079
exceptions are a good thing they let you

400
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,899
roll out of control in a way that you

401
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,100
could roll it out without worrying about

402
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,200
every detail and when a user is asking

403
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,760
you that should not be the time when

404
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,079
you're having a security conversation

405
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,880
and again this does not mean that you

406
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,260
should give everyone an exception you

407
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,820
should be clear when you don't but

408
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,199
definitely don't treat this as an

409
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,959
opportunity to you know cause your users

410
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,060
pain exceptions are a good thing people

411
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,920
who need exceptions should get them

412
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,600
proactive not reactive

413
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,920
some security incidents are genuinely oh

414
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,800
 moments this is one of them

415
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,820
we both spent a week over Christmas 2021

416
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,320
responding to log4j and that's okay

417
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,540
attempting to plan for these type of

418
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,160
incidents isn't worth your time

419
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,260
however every day there's another 9.2

420
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,120
CVSs vulnerability there's another

421
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,220
breach in one of your vendors or there's

422
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,139
another super scary tweet

423
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,120
that your leadership saw

424
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,459
um these are not oh moments uh

425
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,380
they're your job uh and attempting to

426
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,880
treat them as such will cause you to

427
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,180
burn out

428
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,440
be proactive

429
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,180
a threat model tells you what risks

430
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,320
really matter

431
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,760
but more importantly it tells you what

432
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,920
risks don't matter

433
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,079
when your VP asks about that scary tweet

434
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,480
use Telemetry to put the risk in context

435
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,339
so you can get back to proactively

436
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:54,839
defending your organization instead of

437
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,220
dealing with this

438
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,160
establish remediation slos before

439
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,380
vulnerabilities happen for everything

440
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,800
that's not log for J Don't Panic stick

441
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,600
to your slos

442
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,540
ing your team or partner teams to patch

443
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,500
faster

444
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,380
will lead to burnout

445
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,420
there are security teams like incident

446
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,699
response teams that are built to be

447
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:20,339
constantly handling emergencies

448
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,860
if you aren't on such a team constantly

449
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,360
jumping from emergency to emergency

450
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,000
we'll burn you out

451
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,639
if a problem isn't worth involving your

452
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,500
incident response team

453
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,120
it's not worth working nights or

454
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,139
weekends go home

455
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,899
Eric

456
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,320
foreign

457
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,940
and then finally we're going to talk

458
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,399
about communication

459
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,399
um so I'm really lucky to work somewhere

460
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,079
where we hire a bunch of smart people

461
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:50,699
it's actually kind of like a gift and a

462
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:53,279
curse but that's a different talk

463
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,360
um

464
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,579
I've been in rooms where I have the

465
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,920
security title and I am the least

466
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,899
qualified person to talk about security

467
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,240
for a particular problem right and

468
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,699
that's okay but I think what this has

469
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,520
really taught us is that these teams

470
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,099
don't put up with your BS of like this

471
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,280
is important because security which

472
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,319
well that obviously sounds like a straw

473
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,400
man

474
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,919
that is the essential argument for a lot

475
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,780
of the things that I hear sometimes from

476
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,459
security teams why is this important

477
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,059
because security

478
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,120
we want to get you past because security

479
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,660
uh one of my biggest pet peeves is one

480
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,940
anyone ever says the word privilege of

481
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,039
you know

482
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,480
principle of least privilege or

483
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,039
mandatory Access Control versus

484
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,160
discretionary Access Control if you ever

485
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,660
say that I'm muting the thread and I'm

486
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,160
not listening to you

487
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,340
and then be transparent why is more

488
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,559
important than how expressing what

489
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,480
you're trying to do or what you're

490
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
trying to protect is more important than

491
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,120
how you are trying to do it again going

492
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,280
back to those rooms I've said like I

493
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,960
want to do this control because I'm

494
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,120
scared about this data and some senior

495
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,460
SRE shows up and says oh I can get to

496
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,200
that data five different ways that's

497
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,520
actually a good conversation right

498
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,320
because you've expressed to them what

499
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,820
you're trying to do rather than how to

500
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,400
do it and then be consistent it it's

501
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,900
really hard on these teams because

502
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,640
you're going to have to hire Junior

503
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,740
Engineers occasionally and they're going

504
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,780
to have to sit in those meetings too and

505
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,340
if they don't have a reason other than

506
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,620
because security it's hard for them to

507
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,600
have the same sort of sense of

508
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,059
consistency with those teams and get the

509
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,980
same outcome you know you cannot be the

510
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,480
person triaging every single

511
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,039
conversation or you're gonna have to go

512
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,539
on vacation sometime

513
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,940
and then in a more meta level like if

514
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,919
you can't explain why something is

515
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,980
important it might not be so this is

516
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,360
actually a really good exercise for

517
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,580
yourself to figure out like why is this

518
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,160
important to us at all

519
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,700
and then finally uh be rigorous so

520
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,220
um our friend Guillaume came over from

521
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,160
Mozilla to our team and introduced this

522
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,600
thing called the rapid risk assessment

523
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,380
this is like a two-page template that

524
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,940
says like here's how you write up a

525
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,799
security assessment and the craziest

526
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,140
thing about it is it just says like what

527
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,299
is the data are you concerned about what

528
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,400
are some examples of how an attacker

529
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,080
might get around this control and get

530
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,760
access to that data what are the

531
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,559
mitigations and what is like things we

532
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,880
should get to eventually and what is

533
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,580
Over My Dead Body and that seems like

534
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,679
not a lot but it is dramatically

535
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,780
different just to have some structure

536
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,240
particularly for any of your users or

537
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,000
any of your partner teams like that

538
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,820
drives conversations so much better so

539
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,020
we use a framework if you can

540
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,720
we found that security is as much about

541
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,760
workplace culture as it is actually

542
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,860
defending the organization

543
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,240
users in different types of

544
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,860
organizations have radically different

545
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,360
expectations

546
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,700
as an extreme example the NSA gets away

547
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,080
with sticking their users in a

548
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,360
windowless box with no cell phone

549
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,340
Google cannot get away with putting our

550
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,919
users in a windowless box

551
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,860
getting the balance of security and

552
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,660
culture can be sometimes incredibly

553
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,620
difficult

554
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,720
and getting it wrong can lead to

555
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,580
backlashes that destroy your company

556
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,100
culture and burn out your team

557
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,200
you can that leads me to my next point

558
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,960
you can inadvertently have

559
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,299
huge impact on your company culture just

560
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,340
by deploying security controls

561
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,340
as an example if you start deploying if

562
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,600
you start requiring your users to use

563
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,799
MDM

564
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,360
this fundamentally on their personal

565
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,400
device this fundamentally changes their

566
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,740
relationship with the company

567
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,660
and that isn't necessarily a bad thing

568
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,480
but be honest with yourself

569
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,100
when you're rolling out security

570
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,440
controls that have cultural contexts in

571
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,980
your organization

572
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,380
and um

573
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,700
yeah

574
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,039
I think that's basically the rest of the

575
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:59,340
talk and I think that hopefully what

576
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,400
this talk has at least described is like

577
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,860
I feel a lot of pressure a lot of the

578
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,780
times with a lot of alarm Bells going

579
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,000
off of you know things that seem

580
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,400
critical or important and for me that

581
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,100
always you know drains me and burns me

582
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,200
out and it is rough sometimes to be

583
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,820
having security conversations because

584
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,740
all conversations kind of feel like that

585
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,740
uh scale is unforgiving right you can

586
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,419
keep having those conversations but that

587
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:25,740
doesn't mean that you're actually going

588
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,080
to be solving the core security problems

589
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,000
and you can feel like you're doing a lot

590
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,640
and actually not doing anything and then

591
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,000
again like this is very easy for us to

592
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,919
sit up here and you know give this talk

593
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,480
and say this is how you all should be

594
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,820
doing but just know that like everything

595
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,559
is on this slide because at some point

596
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,860
we have failed utterly at that so do not

597
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,419
like think that this is how you should

598
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:50,100
run your security teams and you know you

599
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,900
must do all of this but more that we

600
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,520
hope that if you go back to your company

601
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,200
and you know or doing something that

602
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,520
sounds like something we've talked about

603
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,740
in this slide that this gives you some

604
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,919
amount of tooling or capabilities to

605
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,080
help you approach it in a healthy way

606
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,659
without just burning everyone out so

607
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,360
with that

608
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,039
thanks

609
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,080
right

610
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,760
[Applause]

611
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,100
there will be bastards is there yeah I

612
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,159
guess folks sorry uh from our uh

613
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,419
leadership we're going to be pushing a

614
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:22,799
clean up and kind of sweep through the

615
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,900
theater so QA again will be pushed out

616
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,179
to uh the freestyle Cipher in the

617
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,100
hallway outside of the theaters thank

618
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,299
you

619
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,780
thanks everyone
