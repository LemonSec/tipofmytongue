1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,560
so again we're going to be talking about

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,540
Security compliances Source card and

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,180
basically try and see if we can you know

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,099
kind of do and solve the problem a

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,139
little bit so one thing we did at Adobe

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,880
primarily before we went on this journey

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,559
was to create something in which we

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,240
called internally as a common controls

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,260
framework and in short CCF and basically

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,699
you you'll be hearing a lot about common

11
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,740
controls across the industry now if

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,640
you're associated with security

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,320
compliance in any way but when we

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,019
started this journey in 2012 2013 there

15
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,699
weren't too many Frameworks out there so

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,320
we basically decided to create something

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,180
that would work for our engineering

18
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,040
product and security teams and that

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,079
teams could resonate with and anytime we

20
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,160
had to go and achieve a new

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,500
certification we didn't have to go and

22
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,059
repeat all of the requirements so that

23
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,100
was step one was to build a unified

24
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,719
common controls framework so the next

25
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,860
two minutes I'm going to just quickly

26
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,079
Breeze through you know what that means

27
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,940
what's the kind of work we did and just

28
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,340
move on from there

29
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,420
most of you should already be aware of

30
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,199
adobe so basically you know this is just

31
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,440
a quick snapshot of the organization

32
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,780
so we primarily have three Marquee

33
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,459
products I mean we have much more but

34
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,080
these are ones that we are most famous

35
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,700
for out there in the industry we have

36
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,780
the Creative Cloud which is your

37
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,760
photoshops the lightrooms and all the

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,439
goodness that comes with Creative Suite

39
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,299
we have the document Cloud which is you

40
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,119
know Adobe sign PDF and a lot of the

41
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,619
folks in the industry out there use it

42
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,060
and then finally we have the experience

43
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,880
Cloud which is our our business Suite of

44
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,340
you know marketing and other solutions

45
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,259
to basically help promote the Enterprise

46
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,159
marketing space

47
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,259
so with that

48
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,960
um let me just this is a lot of clicking

49
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,140
yeah so with the common controls one

50
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,000
thing what we did was

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
um we created something which was known

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,540
as when we first started you know

53
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,579
talking about this problem we basically

54
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,020
had something which we called as a

55
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,899
compliant soup so back in 2012 2013 you

56
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,820
know as Adobe is migrating towards the

57
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,799
cloud there were a lot of questions on

58
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,619
how do we basically meet with regulatory

59
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,020
and security compliance topics such as

60
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,720
sock 2 ISO any other certifications such

61
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,579
as fedramp and others and what we

62
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,079
famously called back then you know

63
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,758
internally was a compliance soup like

64
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,258
how do we go meet with access change

65
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:11,520
management a lot of these good

66
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,500
requirements and go talk to Engineers

67
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,060
without them basically you know getting

68
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,160
upset with us and trying to make sure

69
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,080
that the organization complies with a

70
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,300
lot of this so the concept of the CCF

71
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,420
was we took about 2500 or 3000 industry

72
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,160
requirements which you see on the left

73
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,920
we built the magic funnel internally and

74
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,420
then we that funnel basically just

75
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,360
distilled out about 300 350 crisp

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,220
requirements that we had that we could

77
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,780
basically go back to engineering teams

78
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,819
with and product teams and security

79
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,099
teams and say okay if you want to meet

80
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,739
with ISO or sock or fedramp you know

81
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,660
this is that one Chris requirement you

82
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,640
need on access or this is the one crisp

83
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,500
requirement you need on configuration

84
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,599
management or change management so we

85
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,400
started with kind of creating a lot of

86
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,080
these requirements in a manner that

87
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,940
engineering and operations teams and

88
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,739
product teams could understand easily

89
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,319
versus just giving them a raw transcript

90
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,239
of the framework and saying go decipher

91
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:04,620
this yourself and you know go and

92
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,660
implement it so we started kind of doing

93
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,099
a lot of that translation we started

94
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,080
building those common controls and we

95
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,860
went from about 2500 to about 350 400

96
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,879
requirements and in 2018 we basically

97
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,159
open source that framework as well so

98
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,840
that our peers in the industry could

99
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,000
actually leverage that and and you know

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,080
as they were building their own common

101
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,580
controls we just wanted to share that

102
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,500
common knowledge and that goodness so

103
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,420
others could also use it

104
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,360
so from there we basically what we did

105
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,060
is we devised a baseline like which was

106
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,580
okay what do we do to meet with sock to

107
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,239
ISO PCI and others and what we did is we

108
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,519
built an incremental roadmap so we said

109
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,379
if you have the Baseline level set of

110
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,420
controls which was about 100 140

111
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,060
controls you automatically can you know

112
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,700
try and you know achieve a sock 2 and an

113
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,319
ISO and within stock to stock to

114
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,400
security availability and

115
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,560
confidentiality particularly and then

116
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,120
obviously there's privacy and others too

117
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,980
but you know and then we kind of tagged

118
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,120
on ISO 27001 17 18 and a few other

119
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,560
Frameworks and we built that as a

120
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,140
baseline so then you know as you know

121
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,420
with Adobe we accept like payment card

122
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,459
data on our on our on our on our

123
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,079
creative site or you know on our on

124
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,820
adobe.com so if there were certain

125
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,339
products or services that required like

126
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,199
payment card workflows to be enabled and

127
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,600
making sure that we meet with PCI DSS

128
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,979
requirements so what we did is we just

129
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,660
added on those 10 or 20 additional

130
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,460
controls instead of having that product

131
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,500
team go through the entire fire spaces

132
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,060
controls because we'd already

133
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,800
established a step Baseline so at that

134
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,560
point it was an additional 20 then our

135
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,820
our sum of our government Cloud

136
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,680
Solutions were required to meet with the

137
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,759
stringent requirements of federal

138
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,800
moderate so you're like okay we have the

139
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,300
Baseline we have these core set of

140
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,340
controls this is an additional 40-year

141
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,960
additional 50 that we need to kind of

142
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,060
meet with our gov Cloud obligation so we

143
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,040
kind of started to continue build on

144
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,199
that and build that muscle memory and

145
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,000
basically have those inherent controls

146
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,280
and those extra controls that we had to

147
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,940
build so so from there we basically

148
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,100
reached a level of maturity where there

149
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,720
was any new industry framework we would

150
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,400
rationalize it we would take it through

151
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,380
a magic funnel build the common controls

152
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,120
and make sure that we were complying

153
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,340
with them consistently across various

154
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,239
parts of the business unit

155
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,560
once we achieve that state we obviously

156
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,900
wanted to see what can we do next and we

157
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,280
started going and reaching out to our

158
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,840
engineering communities internally as

159
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,419
externally and one thing we often heard

160
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,940
about was challenges with you know

161
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,280
ongoing effectiveness of compliance and

162
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,199
how do you kind of go meet with that so

163
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,000
our security and our engineering teams

164
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,340
were spending anywhere between 40 to 80

165
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,800
hours a quarter I'm trying to meet with

166
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,900
the quarterly compliance obligations or

167
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,699
these compliance obligations that are

168
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,620
repetitive once you get the

169
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,600
certification requirements so the Big

170
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,460
Challenge in front of us was how can we

171
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,919
streamline that and make that easier

172
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,600
given that we've already kind of built

173
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,120
this framework around common controls so

174
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,880
what we did is we basically started

175
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,039
thinking of compliances source code or S

176
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,600
code and started building these

177
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,759
requirements on an engineering front and

178
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,440
trying to see what can we do to kind of

179
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,060
implement these early into the life

180
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,680
cycle instead of it being an

181
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,360
afterthought and then also trying to see

182
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,759
how we can reduce compliance fatigue

183
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,380
which is often the term used in the

184
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,539
industry but taking away the need of

185
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,160
screenshots for evidence and you know

186
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
kind of building more completeness and

187
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,180
accuracy in our checks rather than

188
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,860
having an engineer go and take like 50

189
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,860
screenshots of a source code repository

190
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,319
or of an access management tool

191
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,060
um but rather writing like source code

192
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,380
checks that they could basically run

193
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,960
scripts off or internal platform could

194
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,940
pull that off and then we could use that

195
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,100
and Supply that as evidence for an

196
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,199
auditor

197
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,259
so the way we thought about this was we

198
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,539
had a three-fold vision the first one

199
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,759
was what can we do to reduce compliance

200
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,759
fatigue the second one was what can we

201
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,280
do to bring near real-time dashboards so

202
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,360
one thing when you're in the security

203
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,340
compliance space there's always these

204
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,740
concept of audits now audits are usually

205
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,240
like point in time and you basically

206
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,979
have your either your internal audit

207
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,840
team or internal assessment team and

208
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,400
then your external audit team that comes

209
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,139
and then obviously in certain cases does

210
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,240
a look back and in other cases there's a

211
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,100
point in time testing but by the time

212
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,919
the audit is conducted it's usually it

213
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,479
could be anywhere between a two month to

214
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,880
a four month exercise well guess what if

215
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,199
there was a risk that was introduced

216
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,539
because of a control failure that risk

217
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,280
had continued to exist for that duration

218
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,740
of time so our goal was what can we do

219
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,740
to build near real-time dashboards so as

220
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,740
and when a control is failing

221
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,940
engineering and product teams and and

222
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,880
security teams have easy access to those

223
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,319
control failures and they're able to

224
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,000
kind of detect those earlier into the

225
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,860
life cycle instead of waiting for a

226
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,300
manual order to happen

227
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,300
and the last aspect was how can we

228
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,699
self-service a lot of these requirements

229
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,039
and move to complete control automation

230
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,500
so one of our goals was to make sure

231
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,539
that if an engineering team today you

232
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:58,919
know understands that they have a use

233
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,740
case around sensitive uh personal data

234
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,139
or you know Health Data then they should

235
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,300
be able to self-service a lot of those

236
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,000
requirements and the controls instead of

237
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,860
waiting for a team to come to them and

238
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,240
kind of explain to them what the gaps

239
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,340
are and those Gap exercises would take

240
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,860
anywhere between 8 to 16 hours to even

241
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,020
longer depending on the use case instead

242
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,280
of that we kind of started building

243
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,860
modules internally where an engineering

244
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,940
team could come in they could

245
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,740
self-service they could put in what

246
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,180
their use case was their business case

247
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,860
was obviously we do have a little bit of

248
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,840
manual intervention at that point to

249
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,339
really extrapolate on the business use

250
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:33,479
case but then they'll be able to

251
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,339
generate tickets and they'll be able to

252
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,839
generate their list of controls that

253
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,940
they need to implement with Claire and

254
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,620
crisp guidance on how to do that

255
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,600
so we had four stages during this

256
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,480
journey the first stage was how do we

257
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,700
build a data catalog because with any of

258
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,200
this work that's required and if you

259
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,180
need a platform to come and talk to you

260
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,620
and to talk to your engineering and

261
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,060
product teams the platform needs to know

262
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,339
who to go talk to so the first one was

263
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,380
how do we build a data catalog and at

264
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,860
Adobe we've always had a level of like a

265
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,420
product catalog and a data catalog but

266
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,339
then we had to make sure that it spoke

267
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,080
to our automation platform or our

268
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,180
internal platform and how can we make

269
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,920
sure that that data could be leveraged

270
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,680
when or Source a code based check is

271
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,080
being run and if it identifies say a

272
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,060
control failure which product team does

273
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,800
it need to go to which Cloud account

274
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,959
does it need to hit and then where does

275
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,760
the ticket or the corresponding Alert in

276
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,680
a dashboard needs to be created so the

277
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,600
first thing we did is we created a data

278
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,760
catalog that could speak to our internal

279
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,640
compliance platform our step two was as

280
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,620
I mentioned earlier a lot of these

281
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,100
activities are annual or they are you

282
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,260
know longer time based so what we did is

283
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,080
we started you know kind of dissecting

284
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,240
these activities into more quarterly or

285
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
more real-time activities so for example

286
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,899
we created something which is called

287
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,519
quarterly compliance review so instead

288
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,839
of doing a lot of these reviews on an

289
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,760
annual basis we started doing them like

290
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,339
quarterly or even lesser to make sure

291
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:00,779
that we were able to kind of build these

292
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,880
into repetitive tasks that can be

293
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,640
provided once we basically did that our

294
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,680
stage three was to build more

295
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,779
self-service modules which was to make

296
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,279
sure that platform and Engineering teams

297
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,080
can easily leverage a lot of this

298
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,779
information readily by themselves and be

299
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,580
able to kind of Leverage them while they

300
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,800
were building the product and not as an

301
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,300
afterthought after they built the

302
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,260
product to come and talk to the

303
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,180
compliance team and the last stage was

304
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,500
obviously moving from a completely

305
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,899
manual effort to a state of automation

306
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:30,240
where a lot of these checks and and you

307
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,820
know these notifications can be built

308
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,860
into a rules engine that we can take

309
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,080
forward to the product team

310
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,720
so with that

311
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,040
architecturally this is a quick

312
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,080
visualization of how we went about this

313
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,540
so we had some shift left activities as

314
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,100
well where we were kind of building them

315
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,339
into the product teams you know backlog

316
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,839
and and when they were building the code

317
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,700
instead of coming as an afterthought but

318
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,200
then we built a whole automation

319
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,899
platform where what we did is we had

320
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,399
these four layers

321
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,600
um the first layer was obviously the

322
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,880
infrastructure layer which was okay how

323
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,380
can we build a platform that can speak

324
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,940
to engineering teams and their systems

325
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,320
and be able to kind of Leverage

326
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,959
information the second layer was the

327
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,120
integration layer so we had a lot of

328
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,820
these Security Solutions and and you

329
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,380
know solutions that engineering teams

330
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,720
use today our goal was that our platform

331
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,820
can actually talk to them rather than to

332
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,200
talk to the engineering teams and get

333
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,060
manual screenshots to be able to build

334
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,860
Integrations to a lot of these Solutions

335
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,500
and be able to pull in data as needed

336
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,079
for compliance and audit reviews the

337
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,459
third layer which was the most important

338
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,019
layer is what we call it the rules

339
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,240
engine so we started building rules

340
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,800
within the source code to be able to

341
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,320
kind of Leverage a lot of this data

342
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,880
articulated with the data catalog and

343
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,680
whenever there was a rule failure it

344
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,779
would basically just identify that rule

345
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,000
failure and then it would pop up as a

346
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,800
notification into the fourth layer which

347
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,839
is the visualization layer so once the

348
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,399
visualization layer would catch on to

349
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,540
something it would relay that

350
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,980
information back to the engineering

351
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,240
teams mostly it was uh uh uh detective

352
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,339
control in some ways in some cases it

353
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,200
could also be a preventive control so

354
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,579
depending on the nature of the control

355
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:07,920
you could build the platform in that

356
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,779
manner

357
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,640
um so here is just another illustration

358
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,180
so as you can see when we have our uh

359
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,399
the product team you know control area

360
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,620
or the product team environment you have

361
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,180
a lot of these checks that we need from

362
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,920
a compliance perspective whether that's

363
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,000
configuration management change

364
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,860
management a lot of that what that

365
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,200
translates into is more vulnerability

366
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,720
scanning more pen tests uh you know

367
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,640
getting access logs and getting other

368
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,320
logs we were able to pull all of this

369
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,560
later build it into a source code based

370
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,079
uh platform be able to get a lot of that

371
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,480
back build a data catalog that can speak

372
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,399
to a lot of these checks to identify

373
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,500
where the platform failure is happening

374
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,380
or the or the failures happening make it

375
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,940
talk to a rules engine which would

376
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,100
identify when a rule would be triggered

377
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,380
that would cause that and then finally

378
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,139
through our log aggregation solution and

379
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,480
our ticketing solution be able to relay

380
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,760
a lot of that information back into a

381
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,060
streamlined uh visualized dashboard so

382
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,740
with that we were able to kind of take

383
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,980
out a lot of the the need for manual

384
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,200
evidences or repetitive exercises that

385
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,360
we unfortunately had to have our

386
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,459
engineering teams do in the past but

387
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,680
make it more code driven and basically

388
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,139
be able to help them give them crucial

389
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,060
hours back so they can continue to build

390
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,619
the Great products that they always do

391
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,019
so here are some you know visualizations

392
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,820
of how our engineering teams see our

393
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,560
platform today so when they have to go

394
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,180
and do access reviews they no longer

395
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,980
have to go to like multitude of systems

396
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,200
all of that is linked into a system that

397
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,540
they can basically easily leverage

398
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,740
um they don't have to go take manual

399
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,500
screenshots they see us uh sorry I think

400
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,579
PDF uh Google is messing up the view but

401
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,339
basically they see a list of all users

402
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,320
the users of course has been redacted

403
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,240
but you'll see their you know various

404
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,740
access rights and you'll see everything

405
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,019
there they simply have to go and just

406
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,060
perform the access review right within

407
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,440
the platform itself because of the

408
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,880
Integrations it relates this information

409
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,100
back to various systems and those

410
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,380
changes happen where needed and in a lot

411
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,240
of cases they do and what they have to

412
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,620
do is when because it's a quarterly

413
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,839
exercise or more repetitive

414
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,399
um over time they don't even have to do

415
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,720
this exercise because the tool

416
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
automatically does a diff for them

417
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,019
identifies what those changes are shares

418
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,240
a summary they simply have to attest to

419
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,279
it in certain cases saying that this is

420
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,959
good and then it can go and perform the

421
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,420
changes as needed

422
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,480
so moving on another thing that was very

423
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,180
apparent during the pandemic was you

424
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,860
know a lot of our customers and even in

425
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,839
Industry everyone wanted to find out

426
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,459
like how are you more resilient like

427
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,440
what happens if you know unfortunately

428
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,380
one of the GEOS has an an issue and you

429
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,940
know we never thought about we always

430
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,740
thought about issues as like fires and

431
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,660
earthquakes and other aspects of

432
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,519
calamities but no one ever like with the

433
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,680
pandemic it was just more widespread it

434
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,079
was across the all Geo across the world

435
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,519
and everybody was going through the same

436
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,199
challenges and we continue to brace them

437
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,360
a little bit even today so with that we

438
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,680
started getting a lot of questions on

439
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,060
how are you you know performing your

440
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,860
resilient activity such as business

441
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,660
impact assessments Disaster Recovery

442
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,760
exercises and others so what we did is

443
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,040
we went from a manual you know effort

444
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,199
where we would teams would come in they

445
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,120
would perform their impact assessments

446
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,980
manually so we built like an in-house

447
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,740
platform again we built some checks into

448
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,540
the platform so as teams were defining

449
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,820
during the Bia say the recovery time

450
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,260
objective or your recovery Point

451
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,360
objective when they were doing actual Dr

452
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,579
our drills um the platform would be able

453
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,260
to kind of ask them those values and be

454
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,820
able to tell them nope you already

455
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,959
defined something on your business

456
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,720
impact assessment and your actual

457
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,160
recovery exercise took longer so it does

458
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,440
those automatic calculations itself and

459
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,360
then points those out it also defines a

460
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,180
list of critical vendors that the other

461
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,279
teams can then leverage for you know say

462
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,320
uh vendor risk management and other

463
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,940
areas so we've been trying to kind of

464
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,160
holistically capture a lot of that data

465
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,260
and make it you know be able to

466
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,760
communicate with one another so this

467
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,220
data can be repetitive versus like when

468
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,139
you go into manual evidence Gathering

469
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,120
it's it's all a lot of screenshot based

470
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,339
it's all manual and cannot be repurposed

471
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,199
year over year so our goal was to

472
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,300
basically capture this data make it talk

473
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,339
to various systems so that you know we

474
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,199
have one consistent set of data source

475
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,639
that we can leverage for a lot of our

476
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,899
activities

477
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,760
so with that

478
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,839
um you know given that we're coming

479
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,699
closer time I did want to share some

480
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:26,279
resources we have our open source

481
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,019
framework as I said you're more than

482
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,459
welcome to leverage it or at least take

483
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:32,100
a look we also we've written a few blogs

484
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,139
on our automation Journey so feel free

485
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,820
to kind of go through those but with

486
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,259
that I'd love to you know since I said

487
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,579
it's going to be more conversation based

488
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:40,259
thought-provoking base so I'd love to

489
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,000
hear questions or if anyone has any and

490
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,040
we'll get our steps up

491
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,959
foreign

492
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,420
so I'm gonna run around with a mic I see

493
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,740
one person with their hand up if you

494
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,839
have questions please put your hand up

495
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,180
and I will come around to you hold on

496
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,500
one second hold on one second I want to

497
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,980
make sure I get you on the mic yeah

498
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,920
yeah so how does uh CCF compare to say

499
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,640
you know nist 853 because that's what

500
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,500
we're doing right now basically using

501
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,839
that as a common framework as we go

502
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,640
along you know getting like you know fed

503
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,339
ramp and state rampants exactly yeah so

504
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,959
if anybody can hear the question the

505
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,459
question was how does CCF compare to

506
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,000
nist 853 so as I said at the start of my

507
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
talk there are a lot of like firstly

508
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
common controls out there so when we

509
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,160
started in 2012 uh there weren't too

510
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,720
many out there but you know when we

511
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,179
built our framework obviously Nest 853

512
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,580
has been ever present and is one of the

513
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,260
gold standards to leverage so definitely

514
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,179
a good idea to leverage that even when

515
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:37,500
we were building a common controls

516
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,059
framework we did take that as one of the

517
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,940
inputs and you know ref4 is what a lot

518
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,200
of the organizations use today for

519
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,360
federal moderate and higher but

520
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,980
obviously with ref fight coming in you

521
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,299
will see some changes there but it's

522
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,220
it's a good idea to leverage that and we

523
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,020
also did Leverage this as one of our

524
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,480
inputs into our common controls uh next

525
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,120
question is first row in the middle

526
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,100
so I noticed a lot of the applications

527
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,600
you were talking about

528
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,500
are basically management of people and

529
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,960
business practices more than management

530
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,039
of actual requirements like when you say

531
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,919
compliance is code I'm thinking of open

532
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,400
S cap or compliance Frameworks where you

533
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,720
literally run them against the

534
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,400
technology and it tells you whether or

535
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,039
not it passes the tests

536
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,900
can you tell us more about what you did

537
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,600
at Adobe related to that yeah so that's

538
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,919
where basically where the rule engine

539
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,600
comes in and that's more for our

540
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,120
internal our internal assessment team so

541
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,580
when we are actually running these

542
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,320
exercises and these audits instead of

543
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,580
like going and manually kind of

544
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,960
attesting to those evidences and

545
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,000
reviewing them we basically are able to

546
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,980
pull that data from our rules engine and

547
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,600
you know kind of make it run through it

548
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,220
and to be able to tell us where those

549
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,440
control failures are and then you know

550
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,059
also for the engineering teams as I said

551
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,980
one of our goals is to get them a near

552
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,500
real-time dashboard so those checks are

553
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,360
constantly running teams have access to

554
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,640
it so the data that we see is what the

555
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,200
product teams and Engineering teams see

556
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,820
so if they're kind of deploying an

557
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,559
insecure configuration or something else

558
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,120
that does not mean the sense of an

559
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,100
operating effectiveness of control they

560
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,900
are able to get access to that you know

561
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,700
immediately as well so some of the

562
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,460
examples I did I shared were more on the

563
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,960
access review in those sites because

564
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,120
that's where it's a lot of pain and

565
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,799
fatigue for teams and they have to kind

566
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,720
of do those repetitively and it's never

567
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,419
fun but then we do have certain Rule and

568
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:25,980
Rule engine and you know we are kind of

569
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,960
trying to mature it as we go to build

570
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,880
more use cases where we can get that out

571
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,620
up front before even an assessment

572
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,120
starts

573
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,620
next question is right in front of you

574
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,940
in the front row

575
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,820
yeah I mean I love this whole concept

576
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,860
but like my first question is is like

577
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,640
what other GRC tools for example have

578
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,980
like the automated API stuff where they

579
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,919
can pull a lot of data in and like why

580
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,559
didn't you use like some off-the-shelf

581
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,559
GRC and then do you guys specifically

582
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,380
did you create your own uh with that

583
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,419
being said and then

584
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,100
um did you guys use like the security

585
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,260
Matrix in order to figure out how to

586
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,660
cross all these particular uh

587
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,940
compliances and then with that being

588
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,679
said is do you guys do compliance back

589
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,200
to back to back to back so you don't

590
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,960
have to gather so much more evidence uh

591
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,640
versus you know putting them out through

592
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,980
the entire year

593
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,380
yeah so I'll there are a lot of

594
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,460
questions so I'll try and remember all

595
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,020
the time but if I did Skip any feel free

596
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,340
to kind of repeat

597
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,260
um so I think the first one was uh did

598
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,419
we look at off-the-shelf Solutions we

599
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,100
absolutely did and when we first started

600
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,799
our journey um we were leveraging a GRC

601
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,900
solution internally as we were part of

602
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,460
the internal audit group we were

603
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,260
leveraging you know a GRC solution but

604
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,419
one thing we noticed is again nothing

605
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,340
against any GRC solution out there I'm

606
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,780
sure there are use cases that it works

607
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,440
for

608
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,480
um in our use case our our biggest you

609
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,820
know constraint that we had was

610
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,320
um you know trying to keep up with

611
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,059
organizational changes and making sure

612
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,460
that the data continues to stay rich and

613
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,020
relevant and that's something that we

614
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,640
saw as a huge shortcoming when we were

615
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,260
kind of working with those Solutions and

616
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,000
the other thing was we would go to these

617
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,620
engineering teams with those uh

618
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,960
Solutions and they would tell us why do

619
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,940
we have to go to now a third platform or

620
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,620
a fourth platform or a fifth platform to

621
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,660
do the work that we do why can't you

622
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,280
bake something with our own ticketing

623
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,600
solution and our own source code

624
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,520
management solution to others and that's

625
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,340
where we saw certain uh you know know

626
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,020
constraints when we were doing that and

627
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,640
we decided that okay building from

628
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,340
scratch and leveraging so when we build

629
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,960
the common controls framework we built

630
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,740
something that was called driver

631
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,260
subscribers so what we did is we had

632
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,000
driver teams out there that we felt

633
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,020
confident in their control

634
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,179
implementation and we asked the rest of

635
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:37,799
the companies to subscribe to those

636
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,020
driver controls once that was done we

637
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,520
felt more confident as we were building

638
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,919
these checks and balances to rely on the

639
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,299
data that these driver teams were

640
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,580
capturing and then relay it back so

641
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,960
that's one of the reasons why you know

642
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,520
we didn't go off the shelf but obviously

643
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,559
we continue to evaluate that and if

644
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,880
there's a solution that would work for

645
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,559
our engineering and and platform and

646
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,419
product teams we would absolutely love

647
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,280
to leverage it but in the meanwhile you

648
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,080
know we continue to build on ours to

649
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,880
bring in more efficiency and scalability

650
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,380
because obviously we can build up

651
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,940
modules a lot faster

652
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,820
last question is up to your right

653
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,100
got one more up here to your ride okay

654
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,000
hi uh great talk by the way thank you my

655
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,039
question is around the rules engine

656
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,360
um I'm sure every dog is a very big

657
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,740
company and you have different systems

658
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,780
having different compliance requirements

659
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,360
so how does a rule Engine account for

660
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,940
such different systems and do you let

661
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,000
your compliance analysts or Engineers

662
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,039
modify those rules as per changing

663
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,900
landscapes

664
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,120
okay great question by the way thank you

665
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,900
so we do uh obviously you know Adobe is

666
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,820
is a is a big enough organization where

667
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,039
there is a little bit of you know uh

668
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,480
different implementations as you would

669
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,980
say but as I was referring to the

670
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,780
gentleman here uh one thing you know

671
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,520
before we even went on this journey was

672
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,200
the whole driver's driver approach where

673
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,720
we wanted to make sure that we had

674
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,419
mostly centralized aware control is

675
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,340
implemented and then encouraging these

676
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,080
teams to kind of adopt that and one easy

677
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,659
conversation to do that was like hey we

678
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,400
have this driver control and we feel

679
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,620
fairly confident in this but if we saw a

680
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,720
pushback from an engineering team it was

681
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,220
just a sit-down conversation to make

682
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,320
them realize if you don't inherit this

683
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,120
goodness you have to go and perform your

684
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,559
own security monitoring which means

685
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,539
these extra 20 controls and guess what

686
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,980
no one loves these extra compliance

687
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,480
activities so a lot of that Journey was

688
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,400
streamlined but to your point there are

689
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,380
always that one-off use cases that

690
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,480
continue to exist so we are tweaking a

691
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,460
rules engine as we go but we are going

692
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,340
after that 80 or 90 so that there is

693
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,320
more scalability and flexibility and for

694
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,480
the odd 10 person sometimes either we

695
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,280
default to a manual review or we

696
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,260
basically eventually build a roadmap for

697
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,460
a team to move over to the central

698
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,320
process but it can never be perfect

699
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,919
I'm I'm so sorry but we are actually

700
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,100
overtime at this point so

701
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,360
yeah yeah you're welcome to take them

702
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,919
outside uh and one final round of

703
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,000
applause thank you so much for our

704
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,630
speaker thank you

705
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,489
[Applause]
