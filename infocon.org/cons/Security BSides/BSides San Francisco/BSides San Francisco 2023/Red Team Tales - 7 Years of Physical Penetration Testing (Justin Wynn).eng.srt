1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,399
uh I'm gonna start some timers up here

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,019
because this is going to be condensed my

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,460
first time given this talk it's one that

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,560
I wanted to do for a very long time uh

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,820
it's about seven years of physical

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,580
penetration testing kind of my career

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,960
Journey from coming from absolutely

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,340
nothing not knowing anything about the

9
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,680
industry to seven years later

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,240
um performing dozens of heists you know

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,740
break into critical infrastructure even

12
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,539
getting arrested once along the way so

13
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,520
it's going to be a good talk hopefully a

14
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,779
lot of good stories here and then the

15
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,820
pictures are chef's kiss whatever makes

16
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,160
it work so who am I first of all I'm a

17
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,199
director of the red team at Coal Fire so

18
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,300
I lead a team of Associates we go out

19
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,280
and Consulting break into all the things

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,960
a lot of the engagements that we do are

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,520
virtual so probably a lot of stuff that

22
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,440
you're familiar with obviously this talk

23
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,700
is going to be focused on physical

24
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,739
security there's some social engineering

25
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,600
components anything past that that I'm

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,820
interested in is ethical hacking SDR

27
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,980
lock picking Etc a list of my

28
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,719
certifications below and then some

29
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,520
non-certification stuff but courses that

30
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,379
I've taken from Red Team Alliance

31
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,840
include covert methods of Entry alarm

32
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,000
bypass Access Control safe manipulation

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,879
and all that sexy good stuff like I

34
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,319
mentioned on the first hopefully last

35
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,240
wrongfully arrested Red Team or along

36
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,860
with my partner in crime so to speak

37
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,260
Gary di Mercurio I've done a couple

38
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,580
talks before

39
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,799
um b-sides I think was the first talk I

40
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,840
ever gave down in Tampa that's where I'm

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,760
from Florida man so good to see you all

42
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,560
over here on your Coast

43
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,420
um keynote at secure world uh did a dark

44
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,860
net Diaries episode and that's still

45
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,939
probably one of my favorite things that

46
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,159
I've done we did black hat as well on

47
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,360
b-sides is always going to have a

48
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,560
special place in my heart since the

49
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,000
first security conference that I ever

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,100
went to and then thought Con coming up

51
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,600
so if no one's going there I will see

52
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,799
you there

53
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,659
all right so the talk

54
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,100
um we're gonna go back round again like

55
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,900
I said how I got into the industry some

56
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,340
of the first engagements the highlight

57
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,960
reels that show some of the pictures or

58
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
some of the best parts

59
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,200
um career details kind of like what I

60
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,479
see uh physical security uh being what

61
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,280
it's going to develop into and on our

62
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,380
industry Outlook going forward so I

63
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,520
think it's very important the first

64
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,740
question that we ask ourselves why phys

65
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,259
SEC right why physical security

66
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,759
um for me personally there's nothing

67
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,799
better to rob banks and break into the

68
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,240
critical infrastructure so that's why I

69
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,460
do it from the information security

70
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,459
standpoint it's absolutely invaluable as

71
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,380
and don't roast me for this but I think

72
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,620
externally virtually things may be

73
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,239
getting a little bit more secure over

74
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,739
time or at least out of the box things

75
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,000
seem to be happening a little bit better

76
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,700
so as organizations mature and we're

77
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,620
testing things properly sometimes the

78
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,239
external infrastructure does get locked

79
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
down past that people I see breaching

80
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,739
nowadays uh primarily stems from social

81
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,500
engineering attacks and going down the

82
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,060
road as that gets more hardened defense

83
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,260
the one thing that we're not looking at

84
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,420
is physical security so if you can walk

85
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,800
into a building or if you have your

86
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,180
employees in there you have Insider

87
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,160
threats that can walk around and

88
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,200
circumvent all the virtual controls that

89
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,940
you've put in place what happens then

90
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,220
what happens if somebody walks right

91
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,480
into the security operations center

92
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,500
right

93
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,739
so uh along with that I see even in the

94
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,180
infosec community we see a lot of people

95
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,800
come to conferences like this and they

96
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,239
say well what's what's the lock picking

97
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:58,620
Village what's going on there this is a

98
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,120
hacking conference right

99
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,000
not wrong not wrong but that's our first

100
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,040
tangible exploit that we have in our

101
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
hands where we can see a lock pop open

102
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,120
right in front of our eyes and that

103
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,500
feedback just you can see it in

104
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,940
everyone's eyes the first time they Pop

105
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,920
A Lock and it's so important and it

106
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,420
drives you know a whole different type

107
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,220
of security that I think if we're not

108
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,959
looking at and not educating our

109
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,400
customers on we're doing them a

110
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
disservice so

111
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,519
I've been going around for a little

112
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,260
while building this talk out like I said

113
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,819
it's my first time giving it so super

114
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,140
excited for this

115
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,940
um but you know I solicit advice from

116
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,319
people that I meet out at the bar or

117
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,480
what have you first question like

118
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,159
invariably I wanted a couple plants in

119
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,659
here so we do live

120
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:37,920
um but the first question I get is how

121
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,780
did you break in the industry how do you

122
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,459
do this like that's a crazy job never

123
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,799
heard of that very fair question right

124
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,440
so I came out of college I was working

125
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,239
in a grocery store I was a marketing

126
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,819
degree I had no idea what I was going to

127
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,739
do right so things got pretty real after

128
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,299
I had to like face the real world and

129
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,280
start making my own money

130
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,080
um what was I going to do for work you

131
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,819
know I was technically inclined I had a

132
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,500
couple passions

133
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,599
um there were breadcrumbs along the way

134
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,920
where I should have been in this

135
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,599
industry a lot earlier you know I had

136
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,860
backtrack installed on the family

137
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,760
computer back in whatever 19 something

138
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,500
but then once the Anarchy's cookbook got

139
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,000
found on that parents kind of kicked me

140
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,320
off the computer for a number of years

141
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,600
so that's to me that for sure

142
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,738
um so I'm sitting there and I'm

143
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:20,940
wondering you know what I'm what am I

144
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,560
passionate about what do I love love

145
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
doing and then there's a lot of things

146
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,860
that can be fun you know if you're an

147
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,940
artist or something like that but I

148
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,860
didn't want to be a starving artist how

149
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,600
do I intersect that with profitability

150
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,080
how do I marry my passions with

151
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,660
profitability and that to me the answer

152
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,780
was simple Urban exploration I loved

153
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,639
breaking into abandoned construction

154
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,759
sites abandoned military bases what have

155
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,000
you many of the photos that we see here

156
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,380
about half of these are from a Nike

157
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,240
missile site in Florida if you don't

158
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,880
know back in the Cold War we installed a

159
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,380
lot of missile sites around the country

160
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,120
specifically in South Florida to

161
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,919
intercept ballistic missiles coming from

162
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,720
countries like Cuba right so before they

163
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,180
could reach their targets these missiles

164
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,380
would intercept obviously all

165
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,419
decommissioned now but a lot of this

166
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,340
still exists and it's amazing to go and

167
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,860
explore that kind of stuff around Denver

168
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,139
I loved exploring a Titan II missile

169
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,060
silo which is essentially an underground

170
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,979
city and you can just walk around

171
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,540
there's like you know a rocket ship

172
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,800
that's stored underground it's not there

173
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,199
anymore all decommissioned as well but

174
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,840
see like our history and what that all

175
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,460
meant it was incredible and then the

176
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,720
rest of these photos are just from Urban

177
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,120
exploration around Denver once I got the

178
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,100
job so that was very clear I started

179
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,680
researching urbex and then found out

180
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,300
that that could be a job there's

181
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,919
something where you can break into

182
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,780
buildings and then help them secure it

183
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,479
by exposing how that was done the first

184
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,220
taste I got from that was watching

185
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,320
deviants talks right so probably a lot

186
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,180
of people know him he's on YouTube all

187
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,280
over the place so he had a wonderful

188
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,080
playlist and just every day you know I'd

189
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,900
be working 12 to 16 hours for two months

190
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,340
at a time without a break opening up

191
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,380
this grocery store and at night I was

192
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,820
just hooked I knew this is what I wanted

193
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,100
to do I had the vision I didn't really

194
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,960
know how I was going to get there but I

195
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,820
knew that's what I wanted to do so every

196
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,320
night I would come home I'd watch his

197
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,479
videos while I'm cooking I have a couple

198
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:10,919
of slides here about other other things

199
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,840
that I was researching to help me get

200
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,000
into this industry

201
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,320
um one of the first things I did with

202
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,060
that was I realized okay this is

203
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,560
information security that's kind of

204
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,300
where this is housed

205
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,800
um you know a military government does

206
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,880
some things differently there's other

207
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,620
routes there but I wanted to be an

208
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,479
infosec I realized hacking is where all

209
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,000
the money flows through in this industry

210
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,080
gonna have to Buck Up gonna have to

211
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,520
learn computers so that's the first

212
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,080
computer I ever built which was in a

213
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,699
milk crate from the grocery store they

214
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,259
kindly donated it to me without their

215
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,780
knowledge and I still contend this is

216
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,460
like the absolute Pinnacle of form

217
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,380
factor I mean it's portable it's

218
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,060
stackable it has all the ports you can

219
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,500
plug everything in if you're not doing

220
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,319
it in a milk crate you're doing it wrong

221
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,699
so then I started learning about barcode

222
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,319
hacking so I was learning everything I

223
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,759
could I mean it was all the secret

224
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,160
knowledge coming from the dark web and I

225
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,660
just couldn't get enough anything that

226
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,639
was forbidden fruit I had to have it had

227
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,620
to have a taste so I was on tour all the

228
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,360
time and I saw a barcode hacking I'm

229
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,580
like what is this so this is back in

230
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,080
2013 2014 essentially it's a client side

231
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,539
um verification vulnerability so you can

232
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,699
print up a barcode that says for this

233
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:16,699
product it's going to be 50 or 100

234
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:19,139
discounted applied to the product and

235
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,639
then it never sends to the back server

236
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,860
to verify and check that this was a huge

237
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,539
vulnerability rampant like people were

238
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,520
sweeping the nation with this uh Purple

239
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,080
Lotus was one of the people that I was

240
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
buying barcodes from never using but

241
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,919
like just fascinated with it learning

242
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,120
how it all worked and it really got me

243
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,160
hooked on that but again I'm working in

244
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,419
a grocery store how do I make this work

245
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,000
right how do I learn on the job so we

246
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,500
had a huge issue for this new grocery

247
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,300
store that we opened up none of the

248
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,860
barcodes printed from the deli for

249
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,960
whatever your chicken salad would scan

250
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,940
at the register there was a mismatch in

251
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,639
formats or the checksum what have you so

252
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,139
that's where I got to apply all the

253
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,819
knowledge I learned from barcode hacking

254
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,979
on the job and then we ended up making

255
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,900
all the barcodes work had to reprogram

256
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,580
everything we got things jamming so it

257
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,039
was super cool any other opportunity I

258
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,500
had to practice physical security I

259
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,940
absolutely had to execute on it so I was

260
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,500
on the hunt everyone knew to come to me

261
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,419
for it so somebody got locked out of

262
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,919
their locker one day and they needed

263
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,080
their tea for lunch so I made a little

264
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,360
shim out of a Pepsi can shimmed up with

265
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,520
the padlock got them out their tea and

266
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,620
then the look on that face when I

267
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,819
delivered their teeth they're like how

268
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,919
did you do that man that's the coolest

269
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,699
thing

270
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,800
um so same deal one day somebody locked

271
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,479
their keys in their car probably like a

272
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,020
1995 Honda Civic and this still like

273
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,399
kind of blew my mind for a long time

274
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,520
until I realized what had happened here

275
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,899
anybody know what the keys on the bottom

276
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,479
there are says Club Car anybody you can

277
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,500
shout it out

278
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,839
golf cart keys right so this is another

279
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,159
huge vulnerability that we see there's

280
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,380
key to like systems so this one key

281
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,420
operates all golf carts not gonna die

282
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,640
two feet into that but what I did was I

283
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
took this key used it as a Jiggler just

284
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
on the front door of the car and that

285
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,580
popped it open and if you notice there's

286
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,140
a little bit smaller than a real car key

287
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,060
I had to ask Stevie and years later I'm

288
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,560
like hey man like this happened how did

289
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,480
that work he's like oh it's a valet key

290
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,700
so for the valet for the Pat or for the

291
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,080
driver's side of the door they only used

292
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,000
half the key space about that front half

293
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,220
of the key and this was just the right

294
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,959
length to touch all those uh pins and

295
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,540
scrub it open so any chance I took try

296
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,760
to apply it on the job one of the things

297
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,019
that really stuck with me throughout

298
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,940
this I had a Comcast tech that came by

299
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,800
the house one time he's like man I've

300
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
been in the industry doing Comcast stuff

301
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,760
whatever it is that they do for 10 years

302
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,500
and I really want to get an infosex

303
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,060
sorry for all everyone that works at

304
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,980
Comcast here uh he's like I really want

305
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,899
to get into infosec you know and one one

306
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,279
day I'm gonna do it I'm like man that

307
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,140
guy's been in there for 10 years it was

308
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,000
daunting to me I'm working at a grocery

309
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,260
store and this is the first thing I want

310
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,480
to do but I vowed that I wasn't going to

311
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,860
let that happen to me don't let your

312
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,540
dreams be dreams I was going to go out

313
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,160
there pursue it and get it

314
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,740
so the path to get there again pretty

315
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,240
nebulous I didn't know how it was going

316
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,860
to go but I knew certs were a big thing

317
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,480
right that's kind of a big thing in our

318
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,540
industry so I started from scratch again

319
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,100
I had to learn how to build a computer

320
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,560
how to troubleshoot it and unfortunately

321
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,140
that was the a plus certification which

322
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,940
I'm actually not gonna dog on it I love

323
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,180
that cert I love these books and for 22.

324
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,000
the 1300 pages of information that

325
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,060
provided I read every single page and

326
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,680
this Lata Foundation unlike anything

327
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,720
else that's still today and especially

328
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,399
with the network plus a lot of other

329
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,320
Security Professionals have gaps you

330
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,180
know we're all kind of siled we have

331
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,800
overlapping knowledge but not always the

332
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,660
same that really helps pull things

333
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,220
together for me so I did the same thing

334
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,560
passed that certification went on to

335
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,620
network plus paid 46 bucks read all 800

336
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,600
pages of that and after that I was about

337
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,339
ready to quit because nobody wants to

338
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:41,580
learn about ipv4 and 6 and UDP and TCP

339
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,459
for that long but we went through it we

340
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,380
got it we passed the cert and I bought

341
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,420
the security plus book I didn't read a

342
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,860
single page of that

343
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,240
um turns out I was able to get a job

344
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,980
before I had to go through all that so I

345
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,420
was very very fortunate I got an early

346
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,740
Break

347
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,600
um still an amazing sir I'm sure you'll

348
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,040
have to tell me

349
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,079
um so after work studies I knew VMS were

350
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,220
going to be an important tool as well

351
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,899
right so we can practice technical

352
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,180
skills in this it left out a lot of the

353
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,040
methodology it's almost kind of like Jiu

354
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,839
Jitsu like once you're practicing in arm

355
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,279
bar it's like I saw that for the first

356
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,959
time like why are you practicing there

357
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,880
you gotta like start fighting right and

358
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,500
that's kind of like what VMS are to me

359
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,120
it's very technical you're trying to do

360
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,100
a privilege escalation attack on a Linux

361
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,500
box and unfortunately I'll say I don't

362
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,200
think Linux exploitation has been almost

363
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,079
relevant at all on the job which is

364
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,160
going to speak to them you know the

365
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,300
types of clients that I deal with and

366
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,279
the work that I do but typically we

367
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,079
always work in Windows environments A.D

368
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,360
occasionally Mac and there has been

369
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,640
Linux exploitation for sure but this is

370
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,500
where things got uncertain I didn't know

371
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,300
what I was grasping at if this was going

372
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,100
to be relevant powered through I did a

373
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,079
lot of OAS testing a lot of web

374
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,459
application stuff that turned out to be

375
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,680
highly relevant so we're going to go

376
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,060
past this and I'll show you some lessons

377
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,019
learned and things I would have done

378
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,040
different

379
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,100
but this is an oddball one so SDR

380
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,380
anybody heard of this heck yeah my man

381
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,420
software defined radio has got to be the

382
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,100
coolest out there so I was really

383
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,480
big in a Tesla at the time the

384
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,339
electromagnetic spectrum like physics

385
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,560
nerd all about that and then to know

386
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,959
that you can buy a TV tuner for twenty

387
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,600
dollars and see meteors falling out of

388
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,820
the sky or like watching pager signals

389
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,459
tracking cell phones the things that SDR

390
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,920
can do is absolutely mind-blowing so I

391
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,320
got really big into this and whenever I

392
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,000
needed a break from hacking or reading

393
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,579
that Network plus book I studied on SDR

394
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,019
and that was kind of my break and relief

395
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,120
from things and it turned out this is

396
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,860
what landed me the job because I wanted

397
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,440
that interview obviously so green and

398
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,700
they didn't know whether to hire me or

399
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,620
not but it was the passion behind SDR

400
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,060
that got it to me they're like hey he's

401
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,980
hacking he's trying he's not really

402
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,480
focusing on the right stuff but like you

403
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,579
know he's he's got the spirit you know

404
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,980
all right so after work studies as well

405
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,720
YouTube university has got to be

406
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,920
probably still one of the best

407
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,500
on-the-job resources for me so I think

408
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,540
with about 30 minutes worth of education

409
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,579
on YouTube you can go into

410
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,200
um go go there and break into probably

411
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,720
30 50 of buildings across the United

412
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,700
States so the wealth of the knowledge

413
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,560
there seeing the Defcon talks and

414
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,240
learning about what has become our

415
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,339
industry today was just fascinating this

416
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,980
hacker lore and culture I was smitten I

417
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,019
couldn't get enough so all the resources

418
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,339
there highly recommend if you've never

419
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,019
seen elevator hacking from pit to

420
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,459
Penthouse

421
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,200
um you know the not so civil engineer

422
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,660
UDT guide absolutely phenomenal I was

423
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,339
also reading a lot a lot of Industry

424
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:24,839
literature out there from people that

425
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:26,639
have done it um

426
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,380
I'll focus on the middle one here is

427
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,120
lock safe and security this is an

428
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,980
encyclopedia about pretty much

429
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,899
everything physical security and it

430
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,300
starts off pretty dry too a lot of this

431
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,540
is metallurgy you know Pig metal how are

432
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,220
safes form things like that and then it

433
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,260
gets into latches and safe dials and

434
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,360
everything else and that book's probably

435
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,060
2 000 pages long still working on it um

436
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,980
and it really is it's just to me I love

437
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,959
that kind of stuff so any of these were

438
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,000
great resources looking back to breaking

439
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,079
in the industry

440
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,240
and all throughout this time I'm trying

441
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,800
I'm putting out feelers I know I'm

442
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,720
massively underqualified and this is

443
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,700
actually a letter of rejection from the

444
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,620
company that I work at today Coal Fire

445
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,899
so perseverance right it'll get you

446
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,880
there eventually right I mean fail fail

447
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,200
fail until you get it that was

448
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,600
absolutely it so I scrapped enough money

449
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,839
together for Defcon 23.

450
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,940
um and then to lower the cost of that I

451
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,620
hit up the forums and then one guy

452
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,440
reached out to me his name was cause and

453
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,360
it was the luckiest break I ever could

454
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,279
have had this man hooked it up he had

455
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,980
been coming to Defcon since Defcon 2 and

456
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,720
he took me through all the behind the

457
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,360
scenes the most mind-blowing tour that

458
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,940
no Noob and passerby tourists coming

459
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,560
into the industry has any right to

460
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,019
experience and he was just such such a

461
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,459
kind person to me

462
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,440
um so after that that fueled my fire and

463
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,899
passion after Defcon like it does every

464
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,220
year for me or attending these

465
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,660
conferences I think it's so important

466
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,699
for us to reignite that passion it kind

467
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,519
of energizes us to go forward I kept

468
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,579
putting out The Feelers until finally

469
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,620
Coal Fire responded and they said wow

470
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,839
thank you for your enthusiastic summary

471
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,519
let's see if we can get you on a call

472
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,100
with somebody and ultimately

473
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,899
I went out on site because I knew I was

474
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:07,920
going to be able to do this better in

475
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,079
person than I could remotely remotely I

476
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,120
have no credentials I had nothing A Plus

477
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,339
or a network Plus or I think we can all

478
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,079
agree probably not enough to somebody

479
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,240
come in an infosec in practice and start

480
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,980
exploiting things right

481
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,240
um so I had to go in person and show

482
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,339
them guys like I'm not just like some

483
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,839
wannabe like trying to walk through here

484
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,760
I don't know anything I am very willing

485
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,740
to learn it please give me a chance and

486
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,540
once I met them in person in the offices

487
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,060
and coal fire flew out there for that uh

488
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,699
this is the uh offer letter I received

489
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,560
for them and this was huge to me so this

490
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,720
is my first job out of college you know

491
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,540
going from low hourly rate wage I think

492
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,060
my first job was like 7.25 an hour to

493
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,420
making 65k I hit the big leagues baby

494
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,240
and then I moved to Colorado paying

495
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,940
downtown Denver rent I was like oh we're

496
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,579
gonna need a raise here pretty soon

497
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,019
um so that's I don't know piece of

498
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,220
history there but I want to share that

499
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,019
just you know um talk to a couple other

500
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,000
people once I got in the job and they're

501
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,860
like man did you be honest with me it's

502
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,079
okay did you cry a little bit when you

503
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,339
got the letter I'm like yeah I cried man

504
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,260
I had a tear roll down my face when I

505
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,779
got that for sure so after work studies

506
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,579
if I had to do it over A Plus network

507
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,560
plus all the CompTIA stuff super

508
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,240
relevant for me I think probably

509
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,040
everyone in this room is well past that

510
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,660
if you do have gaps in your foundation

511
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,300
would still recommend it uh SDR was an

512
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,680
oddball and I'm not saying you need that

513
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,260
for infosec um but be passionate about

514
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,060
something that's the core takeaway there

515
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,560
and it was super technical it is

516
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,940
fascinating please get into it and then

517
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,459
we can nerd out over that and then

518
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,800
ideally having an infosec related cert

519
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,380
so whether that was Security Plus oscp

520
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,060
in my mind would be the one to go with

521
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,160
like practical Hands-On I know I had a

522
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,320
hack they've changed the lab since I've

523
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,639
gone through and I think it's now a

524
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,320
little bit more 80 focused and it wasn't

525
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,420
when I was there so anything that you

526
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,100
can get Hands-On active directory

527
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,620
experience or testing external networks

528
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,139
internal networks and applications if

529
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,339
you know anything about compliance

530
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,500
drivers like PCI or HIPAA you're going

531
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,180
to get a job that way one way or another

532
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,679
so you got to think about where the

533
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,199
money flows through and then it is it is

534
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,880
a leap you got to listen to somebody who

535
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,619
knows what they're doing to say hey we

536
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,660
do test almost exclusively web apps

537
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,880
don't waste your time doing mobile

538
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,559
application testing which is which is

539
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,480
huge our company doesn't focus on a lot

540
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,299
so go where a breadth of the um

541
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,760
the work is right so College also not

542
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,140
required so many people are just

543
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,520
self-taught and so much better than

544
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,040
college would ever do so I got the job

545
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,860
first week I almost checked out I'm

546
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,660
going in there I'm sitting next to these

547
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,460
Geniuses these great beards that have

548
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,980
been in the industry for 20 years I

549
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,240
couldn't wait to get out of there be

550
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,919
like guys I have no idea what I'm doing

551
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,080
I'm sorry for wasting your time everyone

552
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,059
had these black little screens up all

553
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,039
over their computer running Linux as

554
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,260
their host OS it was horrifying it was

555
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,440
terrible but the people were amazing and

556
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,000
this is the thread of the hacker

557
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,520
Community these people raised me and I

558
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,620
would not be anywhere where I am I

559
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,940
wouldn't even be in this industry if it

560
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,460
wasn't for them still so I remember

561
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,320
somebody that worked in it they're like

562
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,360
oh yeah man you got to get access to a

563
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,980
lot of the internal resources here go

564
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,419
ahead and set up your ldap account I'm

565
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,660
like dude what is ldat man so I'm going

566
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,760
through and learning what that is and

567
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,160
thus Scotch Saturday was boring so I

568
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,900
invited all the guys out every Saturday

569
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,880
to my place bought a nice bottle of

570
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,059
Scotch and they just grinded me into the

571
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,440
dirt teaching me everything they could

572
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
as fast as they could and I'm forever

573
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,679
grateful for them that's my hacker

574
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,419
family and then later we're gonna have

575
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,039
some stories about how the overall

576
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,900
hacker Community rallied to me so just

577
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,059
there's a takeaway it's I'm incredibly

578
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,020
grateful

579
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,880
um and then I I think I owe a lot of

580
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,500
people in this industry so happy to pay

581
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,520
it back

582
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,559
so let's say you're already in the

583
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,360
industry you probably are and maybe you

584
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,679
want to get on a physical pen test how

585
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:47,940
do you transition how do you get in

586
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,559
there if your company's not doing them

587
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,880
it's going to be pretty difficult I'm

588
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,260
not saying it's impossible but you're

589
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,580
going to have to drive some initiatives

590
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,460
to make that happen I know a lot of this

591
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,799
work does flow through fedramp um it's

592
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,780
not I've never done a fedramp engagement

593
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,980
but

594
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,480
um for like their physical component

595
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,160
there is an on-site requirement to go

596
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,960
through check the camera layouts check

597
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,820
the doors and from what I've seen like

598
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,440
those those teams that I know in our

599
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,240
company that do it not as knowledgeable

600
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,740
as the Consultants like doing this from

601
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,480
an offensive perspective however

602
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,460
compliance drivers money flowing right

603
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,919
common theme it is definitely a viable

604
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,679
Avenue so whiteless walkthroughs I'm

605
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,000
going to talk about this but you can

606
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,860
take away the offensive element of this

607
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,140
and go from a blue team approach you fly

608
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,460
on site and then walk through the

609
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,080
facility with their team in hand and

610
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,640
this alleviates so many issues I have a

611
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,660
different slide on that so we'll get

612
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,360
into it but regardless it's not going to

613
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,740
hurt yourself it's not going to hurt

614
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,419
your chances to start doing this type of

615
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,520
work if you start researching how to

616
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,320
lock pick how to bypass how these

617
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,120
engagements are conducted so red team

618
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,220
Alliance is a great opportunity if you

619
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,419
have the money of some of their courses

620
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,100
around three grand so it's pricey it's

621
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,380
not as bad as Sans but if your company

622
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,660
can pay for that Bingo if not resort to

623
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,340
YouTube pick up the books buy yourself a

624
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,539
lockpick kit carry it with you

625
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:58,559
everywhere

626
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,780
all right so the number two question

627
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,460
that I get if number one is how did you

628
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,380
get in the industry number two is are

629
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,179
you wearing camouflaged you repel down

630
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,100
from the roofs I love it because it's

631
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,080
like 100 of people it's how did you get

632
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,020
the job are you repelling from roofs

633
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,000
um and the answer is obviously not you

634
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,320
know we have to blend in their

635
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,760
environment so typically it's dress

636
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,200
clothes right so we're working in a

637
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,940
corporate setting we can go in like that

638
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,559
sometimes we'll dress as the janitor

639
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,120
sometimes you know it's blue collar

640
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,160
employee we're there to check on the

641
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,600
roof it's leaking right in the data

642
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,039
center how about that we got to go in

643
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,360
there and check you know all the systems

644
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,980
and things are uh looking okay and that

645
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,260
the roof is you know secure

646
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,059
um so going down I'm just in the middle

647
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,799
here that's a prox mark that's an RFID

648
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,140
reader um taped to my buddy's forearm

649
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,240
long sleeve sock for business clothes

650
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,980
but man if you're going to do it hide an

651
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,600
RFID reader under there it's a good use

652
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,799
of it

653
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,160
um just to the right on your perspective

654
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,780
um that's us breaking into a law firm or

655
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,059
we had to hike up like 23 floors through

656
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:55,620
the stairwell to get to like just the

657
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,299
juiciest store that had an inch Gap so

658
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,460
we could under the door tool pop it open

659
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,559
that way and immediately it's uh that's

660
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,299
my buddy Jimmy two times he's a goon at

661
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,700
Defcon just wonderful person

662
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,080
um he's like all right man what what

663
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,220
next I think it's their first time

664
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,780
working I want to say he did engagements

665
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,799
before

666
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,539
um but I go right into the hallway pull

667
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,400
out a full like cupboard of files and we

668
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,900
go right into the handicap stall and

669
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,240
we're just like ripping through this

670
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
um so no typically we're not wearing

671
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,799
camouflage we're not repelling from the

672
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,059
roofs

673
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,440
except for this one glorious time and

674
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,419
this was the greatest engagement I have

675
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,000
ever been on this was a water treatment

676
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,039
facility and an undisclosed part of the

677
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,539
country

678
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,039
um and let me tell you a little bit

679
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,260
about this so five-day engagement five

680
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,419
water treatment facilities at the end we

681
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,039
had to do social engineering component

682
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,380
so this is my first ever engagement this

683
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,360
is about I think four months after I

684
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,039
joined the company and I have been doing

685
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,260
a lot of virtual work this is going to

686
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,820
be the first real one right like getting

687
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,620
paid to do this this isn't robex there's

688
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,880
going to be people here there's security

689
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,580
guards so I go out with a more senior

690
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,740
consultant

691
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,840
and I defer to him and he says you know

692
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,039
what man let's take the woods let's

693
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,600
state that red line let's go through

694
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,820
there it's going to be sneaky covert I'm

695
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,100
like I hear you man I hear you but the

696
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,080
yellow path we can just walk right up

697
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,520
you know there's not going to be like a

698
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,440
lookout station like looking for like a

699
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,600
half a mile to like see us coming so why

700
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,740
don't we just do that and it'll be a lot

701
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,020
easier and quicker he's like no no we

702
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,159
can't do it it's too wide open they're

703
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,539
gonna see us so I'm all right you know I

704
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,000
defer so we go through the red path that

705
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,500
is swampland

706
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,500
it is water the entire way it takes us

707
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,039
three hours to go let's say a mile and

708
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,600
we're checking in on the fence once in a

709
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,919
while and there's like a security guard

710
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,419
there checking the locks and everything

711
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,460
which like never happens by the way if

712
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,360
you really get into this like

713
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,220
everything's wide open

714
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,900
um but uh we're having a slosh through

715
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,880
if you're on the land you know we're

716
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,400
hitting any twig or along the way and

717
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,960
that's not the way to go so we started

718
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,580
going through the water we're in ways

719
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,740
high water waiting over there in this

720
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,880
part of the country there's a military

721
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,820
base nearby so there's Jets ripping

722
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,860
overhead and any time that was our

723
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,340
Saving Grace uh we heard the of the jet

724
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,320
flying overhead and that was our break

725
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,419
to start sprinting and then we could go

726
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,179
100 feet so three hours later we get all

727
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:13,440
the way down to the bottom part of the

728
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,820
facility where the red and the yellow

729
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,840
meet

730
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,320
and the gates wide open so overall it

731
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,840
worked out right I will say this is

732
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,980
another slide kind of shows

733
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,900
pre-construction of that facility

734
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,520
um we came back two days so the yellow

735
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,260
is one and the red is another or the

736
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,159
orange

737
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,919
we had gone through we hit every single

738
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,539
building in here there's people all over

739
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,520
the place we're dressed in full camo

740
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,260
it's not the thing to do if you're going

741
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,059
to be confronted by somebody you get

742
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,740
caught wearing that like I don't know

743
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,960
what your what your excuse is gonna be I

744
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,760
was unprepared for it

745
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,380
um so we get all the way to kind of the

746
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,820
top part of the picture and that's the

747
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,200
admin building we're kind of like

748
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,299
following along a golf cart that have

749
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,340
been moving around here and we stopped

750
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,320
by some dumpsters I'm like damn listen

751
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,419
man this is my first engagement we've

752
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,159
been doing great people talk about how

753
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:00,480
they've never been caught in this

754
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,820
industry why don't we not follow the

755
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,559
golf cart into the last remaining

756
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,700
building where we know there's going to

757
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,620
be a ton of people he's like no no we

758
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,200
got to do it and by the way not getting

759
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,059
caught in this industry is not a good

760
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,380
thing you're not doing yourself a

761
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,460
service and you're not doing your

762
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,260
clients the service unless you're

763
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,760
getting apprehended unless you're

764
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,740
identifying where your client can detect

765
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,140
you and I'll add there is no greater

766
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,720
stress inoculation or bulletproof vest

767
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,520
that you can wear than having a get out

768
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,500
of jail free card and knowing you can

769
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,120
 and talk your way through this

770
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,559
and at the end they're not buying it

771
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:34,200
here's our card we're good to go why not

772
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,700
use that if you have that privilege you

773
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,080
don't get that anywhere else in life so

774
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,820
super cool thing so I'll show you a

775
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,780
couple other pictures from that

776
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,400
engagement which again still probably

777
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,320
one of the greatest of My Life

778
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,539
um but maybe not the most uh insightful

779
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,460
right wearing camo the entire way

780
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,679
through but it really is you know I've

781
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,960
seen these facilities at night you know

782
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,880
places that you've always driven by and

783
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,440
then you know have incredible importance

784
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,840
to our national security it was a

785
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,580
privilege it was a gift to get to see

786
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,960
these kind of things

787
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,299
so here are some other funny ones this

788
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,400
is Dan hopping a fence after we're like

789
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,260
two miles out from the facility so I

790
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,000
take a photo with flash for posterity

791
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,740
and he's freaking out you can't do that

792
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,299
man they're gonna see us I'm like no

793
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,220
they're not Dan

794
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,380
um I vote we have a petition we gotta

795
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,600
like Nix all the cliche photos of

796
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,760
hackers wearing hoodies hackers being

797
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,860
dressed in full camo behind a terminal

798
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,480
that's the way forward that's what we

799
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,000
gotta shift things towards super cool so

800
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,340
I'll add to there's something of a

801
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,720
religious experience here I heard

802
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,820
somebody say in the industry once that

803
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,860
there are things known in this life and

804
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,600
there are things unknown and between

805
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,760
them lies a locked door what does

806
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,500
physical security do for you it teaches

807
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,880
you how to get through those doors it

808
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,380
teaches you how to see this other side

809
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,779
of life whether it's CEO financials or

810
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,400
intellectual property lights it just

811
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,340
pulls down the veil and that Pursuit and

812
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,620
this freedom of all this esoteric occult

813
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,179
knowledge that all of us are seeking

814
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,159
it's here it's in our industry and it's

815
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,600
a beautiful thing it's super cool to be

816
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,919
a part of

817
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,900
so one last highlight from the end of

818
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,179
this story

819
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,799
go ahead and read that I'm not sure how

820
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,240
I didn't get fired from this job just

821
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,679
like solely based on the way I wrote

822
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,860
reports my first hacker nickname was Nat

823
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,080
Geo National Geographic because I'd say

824
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,539
things like oh this exploit not commonly

825
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,940
seen in the wild you know we came across

826
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,640
it while potentially a suspect

827
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,400
occupation and uniform to some the only

828
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,740
confrontation Coal Fire received was

829
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,539
when an employee directed The Coal Fire

830
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,700
team member to put the hat back on after

831
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,919
he had taken it off if you can't see it

832
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,779
there he is dressed up as a Krispy Kreme

833
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,480
delivery man which does not exist not a

834
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,340
real job but we had broken into

835
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,659
everything we've done some social

836
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,760
engineering at this point and we get to

837
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,020
the point where it's like man we just

838
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,640
got to get egregious we gotta like have

839
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,140
somebody detect us so we can give the

840
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,360
client that win and tell them hey to us

841
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,980
here everything else below that we need

842
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,559
to work on so Krispy Kreme delivery man

843
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,500
we tried and we were still successful

844
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,200
so it had been a week on site again

845
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,940
water treatment facilities a lot of

846
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,039
bacteria floating around I am sick as a

847
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,960
dog I'm in the car for half an hour

848
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,580
while he's in there doing his thing

849
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,679
getting all this done and I'll just you

850
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,360
know people are passing me and I'm just

851
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,980
like trying to slink down as low as I

852
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,720
can in there so I'm not like caught and

853
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,760
detecting blow the engagement and

854
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,020
finally he texted me back he's like hey

855
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,820
man coast is clear come on in I'm like

856
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,900
all right cooling gives me the

857
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,860
directions he's like yeah nobody's

858
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,820
watching the door you can just walk

859
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,740
right in I'm in the bathroom go ahead

860
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,840
and bring me the other laptop bag

861
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,279
and so I go in there and gives me

862
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,320
directions walk right in on unchallenged

863
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,299
and so I'm walking in and there's an

864
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,700
employee walking out of the bathroom nod

865
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,500
and then I just see there's one pair of

866
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,480
legs sitting in one of the Stalls so I

867
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,940
take the stall next to them it is Dan I

868
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,900
know you could think that's where the

869
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,159
story's going

870
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,299
um but instead of doing your typical

871
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,059
drug deal where you pass the the drugs

872
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,679
underneath the bathroom stall of the

873
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:48,720
laptop I was going to be cheeky because

874
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,039
man we're having the time of our life

875
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,419
and nothing will bond you together like

876
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,640
a red team engagement I stand on top of

877
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,100
the toilet seat reach on over and I look

878
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,840
down at him just to freak him out his

879
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,880
pants are still down now I'm freaked out

880
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,799
he had been in there half an hour I

881
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,940
thought everything was wrapped up we're

882
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,820
good to go so I'm in horror I look up to

883
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,100
make eye contact with the employee who

884
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,720
had been walking out and he's washing

885
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,039
his hands

886
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,600
and still didn't get caught he never

887
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,100
reported that so I don't know what they

888
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,020
have going on there but that's that's

889
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,299
what it was so we got some other

890
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,919
pictures here these are just random

891
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,200
engagements um let's see far left for

892
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,539
you so safe fault right in a bank that's

893
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,860
just wide open

894
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,000
um and then there were like you know

895
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,620
more secure compartments inside and

896
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,820
those are the easy ones once they're

897
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,500
past the outer layer

898
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,539
um defense in depth does not exist with

899
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,220
physical security

900
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,720
um again things are in disarray we need

901
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,100
you guys in here this is part of this

902
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,779
talk we got to get more people into the

903
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,580
side of the industry

904
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,440
um and again same point so the next

905
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,620
picture over in the fire safe room just

906
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,900
that door that could be loaded um you

907
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,580
know the latch for that door just popped

908
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,620
open and then from there all the keys

909
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,360
which are medical Keys like a really

910
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,340
nice high security key are sitting on

911
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,960
top of the safes right all the file

912
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,419
volts so you can pull those open

913
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:01,980
um the one with car we got to steal a

914
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,840
car that was a dream come true for my

915
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,480
for my career below that we have so many

916
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,820
pictures just in data centers idfs mdfs

917
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,960
what have you

918
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,220
um Diamond doesn't but that's my buddy

919
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,799
Gary's I had to throw him in there

920
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:14,640
um

921
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,320
I don't know just the infrastructure I

922
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,000
see a microcontroller switches factories

923
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,039
to me I have a mechanical mind so like

924
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,440
understanding how a product works is one

925
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,480
thing and then you think about like man

926
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,100
for them to put together this product

927
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,679
and to build the factory a whole nother

928
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,059
thing so getting a break into factories

929
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,380
and see that it just always always

930
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,659
tickles me nice so I like that in the

931
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,220
middle again this is you know getting

932
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,620
egregious with engagements um we just

933
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,539
carry out every one of us had like two

934
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,520
bags of shredded documents and we're

935
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,899
yelling out to employees in the office

936
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,059
hey guys we're uh taking the stuff we

937
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:46,500
probably shouldn't be if anyone wants to

938
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,460
stop us

939
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,340
silence so we just walk away with it and

940
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,779
this this happens all the time we've

941
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,100
been in like the middle of cafeterias

942
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,899
for factories on like third shift and be

943
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,419
like I've had my boss stand up on a desk

944
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,399
he's like ladies and gentlemen I need

945
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:00,779
your attention for just a minute please

946
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,640
my boy here just hacked into your

947
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,320
network stole all the things we have

948
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,820
domain admin if you don't know what that

949
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,460
is it's very bad this is a security Risk

950
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,000
please go to a manager and report this

951
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,580
incident to maybe about 50 employees we

952
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,080
went in for our debrief the next day not

953
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,299
a single one who reported it

954
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:19,980
and a lot of that's culture it's not on

955
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,899
the employees right that's things we

956
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,159
need to incentivize you need to have

957
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:24,539
your secret shopper of somebody trying

958
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,340
to break into a facility where their

959
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,600
challenge where it's incentivized for

960
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,520
the employee get a 50 gift card if you

961
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,799
can detect who that is and then it's man

962
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,360
that story spreads like wildfire

963
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,799
throughout the break room and then

964
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,000
everyone's on the lookout for that so

965
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,679
developing the security culture there it

966
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,179
doesn't apply just to Virtual systems

967
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:39,919
right

968
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,940
bottom right there that's us getting

969
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,760
into a cash safe literally the money

970
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,899
shot

971
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,399
um we may have a pretty cool opportunity

972
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,159
to do a Netflix documentary here

973
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,659
um as a result of some of the things in

974
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,880
our our career so again very blessed um

975
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,559
but the way that it works they film it

976
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,120
first and they pitch it so we'll see you

977
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,559
know and I asked the guy I'm like man

978
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,320
giving a talk soon I don't I don't want

979
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,940
to say hey we have a Netflix stalker and

980
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,380
coming up what are the odds that's going

981
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,360
to happen he's like man Netflix 50 50.

982
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,580
if not it's going to be on Hulu it's

983
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,020
going to be on peacock like one of the

984
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,520
major networks

985
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,020
um at the worst will be on your local

986
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,399
news network that free over the air

987
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,320
stuff but it'll be somewhere so I feel

988
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,240
more confident being able to say that so

989
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,760
engagement highlights a bank heist right

990
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,200
no physical talk would be complete

991
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,520
without one

992
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,200
um nothing too crazy man just stealing

993
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,299
some money from a bank was a lot easier

994
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,340
than you'd think so we go in through the

995
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,140
back door uh it was an emergency like

996
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,820
egress door that wasn't alarmed there's

997
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,620
no handle on the outside so if you ever

998
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,299
see like what they pull up server tile

999
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,279
not server tiles but the floor tiles in

1000
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,659
a server room

1001
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:40,980
um it's like it looks like a headset

1002
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,419
right with suction cups and you can

1003
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:43,980
attach that make your own handle on the

1004
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,679
outside of a door we use plastic Lloyds

1005
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:49,260
like thin cutting boards to go over and

1006
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,240
then slip that latch door pulls right

1007
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,520
open no alarm we go through the office

1008
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,380
space and there's every violation that

1009
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,940
you'd like to see for physic for

1010
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,980
reporting purposes so violations of

1011
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,840
clean dust policy passwords what have

1012
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,179
you we hop behind the teller's desk in

1013
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:05,039
the in this main bank branch and we

1014
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,020
install key loggers on the back of the

1015
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,360
system come back the next day no alarms

1016
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,740
no indication that we were there that

1017
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,120
they were compromised come back the next

1018
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,159
day pull off the teller information we

1019
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,500
had the teller log on for the system and

1020
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,080
boom easy to deposit 100 dollars cash

1021
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,299
deposit thereafter hours the system

1022
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:22,799
locked you out after that you can't

1023
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,299
deposit more than a hundred thousand

1024
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:26,820
unless you have the override credentials

1025
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,279
which were also captured so we could

1026
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,320
deposit any amount of money so we report

1027
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,940
this fine into the client they say no

1028
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,580
well we would have caught that well when

1029
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,940
did you do that Saturday oh man we

1030
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,020
wouldn't have caught that until Monday

1031
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,460
or Tuesday

1032
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,200
and there's a couple laughs is there

1033
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,820
that we help them identify

1034
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,100
so engagement methodology

1035
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,960
CIA like Ops that's a quote from some

1036
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,340
Iowa senator

1037
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,320
uh that was remarking on some of the

1038
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,659
work that we've done before and this is

1039
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,460
my personal approach to engagements I

1040
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,960
like to go in covertly everything

1041
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,279
depends on the rules engagement so

1042
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,299
you're always working within the scope

1043
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:04,620
all that every engagement's different

1044
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,539
personally if we have the flexibility

1045
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,580
too I want to go in get the lay of the

1046
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,960
land understand everything that I'm

1047
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,880
working with at night undetected without

1048
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,980
confronting people and then once we go

1049
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,720
in for social engineering we can do

1050
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,159
things tightly a little bit more

1051
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,799
sophisticated and again we keep dropping

1052
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,320
that guys down until they catch on to us

1053
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,700
and we can rotate different people out

1054
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,380
if you go the other way and you just do

1055
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,120
the Krispy Kreme delivery man right off

1056
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,919
the bat and they catch you engagement's

1057
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,539
over a client has no value so working

1058
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:32,519
your other way up is my preferred uh

1059
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,640
approach so sometimes you know that can

1060
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,840
be authorized entry during business

1061
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,640
hours like you can walk into any

1062
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,080
building that's open during the day and

1063
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,000
use the bathroom what have you AKA

1064
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,460
casing the joint and then that helps us

1065
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,140
get the lay of the land and break in the

1066
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,299
later that night so again every

1067
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:49,380
engagement's different it's going to

1068
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,760
depend on what the client's looking for

1069
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,799
what that flag is so can we connect to

1070
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,179
the network can we to gain access to

1071
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:56,460
sensitive rooms client data donor

1072
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,260
information network access things of

1073
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,539
that nature and sometimes there can be

1074
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,919
purple team components of this where

1075
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,179
we're training the employees and just

1076
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,159
leaving things out of sorts seeing that

1077
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,080
gets reported if that's detected then

1078
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,580
once we have that upper hand then we can

1079
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,980
return back and do our hardcore SE and

1080
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,020
again lowering the threshold

1081
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,719
all right so timelines is something I

1082
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,060
hugely disagree with with the way my

1083
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,918
company does things and the way many

1084
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,599
other companies does this but it's

1085
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,460
dictated by budget right we have

1086
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,800
Consultants there on site it's expensive

1087
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,239
you can't stay there for a month at a

1088
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,859
time and do Recon and surveillance and

1089
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,480
all that if you can that'd be amazing

1090
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,099
that's how if you do this in real life

1091
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,679
like CIA engagements there's plenty of

1092
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,060
times different teams different skill

1093
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,399
sets we hit the ground running so in the

1094
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,260
case of Iowa but anybody heard of that

1095
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,300
Iowa engagement with courthouses

1096
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,040
yeah that was a good one we'll get to

1097
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,480
that

1098
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,800
um that one was five government

1099
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,918
buildings in five days six days right so

1100
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,418
we hit the ground running make our first

1101
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,399
entry right off we had gotten uh off the

1102
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,320
plane later that night on Sunday so

1103
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,420
typically we arrive on site we've done

1104
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,460
Osan Google Maps is pretty much that you

1105
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,660
know you can look around company history

1106
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,460
everything like that but there's no time

1107
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,200
for heavy surveillance we can't do sigan

1108
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,760
we can't do signals intelligence listen

1109
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,500
to employee comms

1110
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,119
um seeing when people come in and out of

1111
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,500
the facility what they're wearing then

1112
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,880
you know get different badges made what

1113
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,619
have you that doesn't really exist in

1114
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:14,700
these time frames that we're working

1115
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,440
with so maybe we have a day for light

1116
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,119
attacks but again I try to make three

1117
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,520
entries two covert After Hours the

1118
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,260
second one typically to retrieve tools

1119
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,599
uh or maybe you know cover cover your

1120
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:25,859
basis for something you missed and then

1121
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:27,480
your social engineering

1122
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,839
so after a while I got the idea to be

1123
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,339
super cool if we start doing whiteless

1124
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,839
walkthroughs instead of the offensive

1125
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,880
approach let's work more closely with

1126
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,200
our clients this might be more

1127
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,940
considered like a purple team approach I

1128
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,520
suppose but instead of doing an

1129
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,140
offensive engagement we're taking a path

1130
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,240
of least resistance low hanging fruit we

1131
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,339
show them a single attack path let's go

1132
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:48,960
in meet with the client walk through the

1133
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,280
whole facility this is a wonderful

1134
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,500
training experience for myself and then

1135
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,240
for the junior associate we try to bring

1136
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,800
along with us too so they can train and

1137
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,839
get learned up the first time this also

1138
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,339
allows us to do more configuration

1139
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,980
reviews see their software assess their

1140
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,599
rules then train and work with that team

1141
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,880
so they can scale that out so this is a

1142
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,040
much big bigger value prop for that team

1143
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,480
if they have multiple facilities and

1144
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,680
they can't afford to assess everything

1145
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,780
let's train your team up then they can

1146
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,460
go around and see what they can see and

1147
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,260
then once you guys get those first bases

1148
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,180
covered then we can come on do the red

1149
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,579
team and then see where the gaps exist

1150
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,680
so we're gonna switch gears here a

1151
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,460
little bit

1152
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,079
um I'm gonna try to leave time for QA

1153
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,280
everything's condensed I think I'm

1154
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,300
already running out of time but we'll

1155
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,119
get through this alarm Hardware so this

1156
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,700
is typically what I'll see on site you

1157
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,339
have your interface this little keypad

1158
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,260
um they'll come in a million different

1159
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,520
formats and it really doesn't matter

1160
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,560
it's a front end for in the top right

1161
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,660
that circuit board that Vista 20p

1162
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,099
everything Aggregates to your alarm

1163
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:46,920
controller so in your

1164
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,400
bottom left that's a PIR motion sensor

1165
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,720
passive infrared

1166
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,180
pretty dumb sensors they can be

1167
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,040
fine-tuned they make higher grade ones

1168
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,020
rarely will you ever see anything fancy

1169
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,400
like physical security always gets

1170
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,900
cheaped out on so bad which is why it's

1171
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,520
kind of so easy I'm not good at my job

1172
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,260
it's just terrible security like it's

1173
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,820
really easy to do

1174
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,900
um so that one you know if you're

1175
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,700
underneath you know the detection

1176
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,320
threshold especially in residences

1177
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,400
you'll see this you know they

1178
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,140
accommodate for pets like your dog's not

1179
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,660
going to trip the motion sensor

1180
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,980
um in the middle here we have read

1181
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,740
switches so these are magnetic based

1182
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,200
detection uh that if a door opens you

1183
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,119
know the the magnetic field separates

1184
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,920
and then that sends an alarm condition

1185
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,020
to the panel and then in the bottom

1186
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,820
right you may not recognize that one

1187
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,920
that's a glass break sensor this really

1188
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,060
doesn't come into play for any of the

1189
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,740
work that I do but it's highly valuable

1190
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,800
to the clients because let's be honest

1191
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,839
if physical compromise happens more

1192
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,220
often than not for most clients it's

1193
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,260
going to be a smash and grab and your

1194
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,640
glass break sensor is going to help

1195
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,500
detect an alert on that right so we have

1196
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,680
detect deter and respond maybe deter

1197
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,560
detect respond but you're not going to

1198
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,000
keep somebody out physically

1199
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,920
indefinitely right even the government

1200
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,079
rated stuff GSA saves they rate it a

1201
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,880
number of time and number of hours it

1202
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,700
would take to compromise that

1203
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,780
surreptitiously covertly and maybe it's

1204
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,540
like six hours but that buys you time to

1205
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,339
detect and respond to that incident

1206
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:09,180
right

1207
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,859
so that's a pretty key principle of

1208
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:12,060
physical security

1209
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,400
so going forward with alarm Hardware I

1210
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,079
rarely see these on site these are

1211
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,760
mechanical switches so this will also

1212
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,380
alert if the door is open these are much

1213
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,180
harder to bypass I'm going to show you

1214
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,740
some bypasses that we have for some of

1215
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,839
the Alarm Systems this one you have to

1216
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,400
be able to depress that on the far side

1217
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,839
of the door the only one that's

1218
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,280
different here is all the way on the

1219
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,300
left

1220
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,480
Gary used his Coal Fire lanyard to

1221
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,800
retract that because it's on the outside

1222
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,420
of the door so obviously anytime you

1223
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,400
have a sensor on the outside easily

1224
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,380
bypassed they're on the inside properly

1225
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,000
installed these are a little bit more

1226
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,320
pain in the butt you can see like the

1227
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,640
electrical conduit coming into them

1228
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,619
they're not as easy to work with for the

1229
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:47,820
installers that's why you don't see

1230
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,220
these so hopefully a little bit more

1231
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,140
work down that side of the industry and

1232
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,180
we'll start seeing those a lot more

1233
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,040
so here's a goofy one for an alarm

1234
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,200
bypass that we did once you've done it

1235
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,400
all in this industry you're just looking

1236
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,320
to have fun with it I mean still provide

1237
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,940
all the class all the value in the world

1238
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,140
of the client but come up with new

1239
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,640
different ways to do things learn more

1240
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,780
about the systems that you're trying to

1241
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,520
defeat

1242
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,960
you got a video there that'll play

1243
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,660
tactical that's our portable hula hoop

1244
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,640
like extended on like barbecue skewers

1245
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,099
10 minutes less seriously all right

1246
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,720
let's speed it up

1247
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,820
um all right go going for it so it

1248
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,380
didn't work and eventually we just ended

1249
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,960
up putting like the um uh space blanket

1250
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,180
over the sensor so it can read out

1251
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,920
um we have a MAG switch in the middle so

1252
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,680
this will emanate its own magnetic field

1253
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,900
and that can keep that circuit closed

1254
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,940
from the outside and then at the bottom

1255
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,220
right we have a pole switch so we can

1256
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,200
identify where those sensors are from

1257
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,880
the outside again something you can do

1258
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,500
with a magnetic sensors not the physical

1259
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,380
ones so here's kind of an exotic one

1260
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,300
that should never really happen but it

1261
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,280
came up once and it's super cool an

1262
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,800
electric strike bypass readers in my

1263
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,880
mind so we always see them on the

1264
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,440
outside and there's vulnerabilities with

1265
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,820
that you can take it apart and if you

1266
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,040
can access the wires you're hosed um

1267
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,780
depending on the protocol but typically

1268
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,460
it's clear text behind there so you can

1269
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,619
install an implant in the reader read

1270
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:08,760
everything coming through and then just

1271
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,520
replay those credentials there are some

1272
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,960
other protections against that but

1273
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,300
typically it's it's not the standard yet

1274
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,460
but anytime you have something Exposed

1275
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,960
on the outside that you can interact

1276
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,119
with you're asking for trouble and

1277
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,380
especially the case in this one where

1278
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,720
you had both the reader and the strike

1279
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,640
uh wires going through so the electric

1280
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,880
strike there we just bypassed the um the

1281
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,560
power for that and then hook that up

1282
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,000
into like what was powering the reader

1283
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,099
that powered the strike to open up and

1284
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,839
then gain access that way for an

1285
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,140
otherwise very secure door

1286
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,540
and they just flickered on enough wrong

1287
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,720
wire

1288
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,320
so then once he gets the right wires for

1289
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,359
the strike just Bridges those into the

1290
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,839
power cable

1291
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,619
click open you guys are so cool

1292
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,900
uh we'll skip this video anytime you can

1293
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,640
see the alarm panel from the outside of

1294
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,200
the building I consider that a bit of a

1295
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,119
vulnerability I don't want that alarm

1296
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,220
status displayed to anybody from the

1297
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,839
outside that should be internally facing

1298
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:26,520
there could be other reasons for that

1299
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,780
and everything's going to be a trade-off

1300
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,640
rate but personally that lets me get a

1301
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,900
good layout maybe I can see that the

1302
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,940
alarm's just off that night

1303
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,560
that's a video but we're going to skip

1304
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,480
it other career highlights everybody go

1305
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,099
to black hat

1306
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,720
yeah two people that work for big

1307
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,220
corporations that can afford it it's

1308
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,540
purely corporate you're not really

1309
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,460
missing too much but it's been really

1310
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,560
fun for us every year cool fire runs a

1311
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,420
lock picking booth there and this is

1312
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,980
also one of the most rewarding parts of

1313
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,560
the career is teaching thousands of

1314
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,300
people to get their first opens while

1315
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,440
they come through and then we have all

1316
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,720
the prizes associated with it so super

1317
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,640
cool super cool

1318
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,020
um career highlights for me personally

1319
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,760
like what this has led to is dark net

1320
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,500
Diaries wired articles we were

1321
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,700
interviewed by the same guy that

1322
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,040
interviewed Snowden Glenn Greenwald

1323
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,320
uh keynoting crabs

1324
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,780
um black hat um and then cool artwork

1325
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,940
and stuff so let's talk real quick about

1326
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,680
the reason a lot of that came up was

1327
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,619
Iowa so many of our uh us had heard of

1328
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:22,440
that we got totally smeared by the media

1329
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,060
and all the statements put out by the

1330
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,980
sheriff in the state were if not

1331
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,400
erroneous completely false knowingly and

1332
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,780
we never got the chance really to set

1333
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,579
this story straight so again I know

1334
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:33,780
we're running out of time but in a

1335
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,880
nutshell the state of Iowa hired us to

1336
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,339
come on site assess their courthouses

1337
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,560
and judicial branch and show them the

1338
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,480
vulnerabilities standard pretty much

1339
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,300
covert penetration test right so we do

1340
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,099
that and we're fully successful and then

1341
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:48,480
you know one night we break into our

1342
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,160
point of contacts desk and I leave my

1343
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,599
business card and then that's the image

1344
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,160
there you say hey sorry about the state

1345
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,079
of my office uh well done I'll be

1346
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:57,599
interested to see how easy it was and

1347
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,339
then our not even the last time it was

1348
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,560
night like two or three we'd assessed

1349
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,880
everything broken and everything we go

1350
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,520
to our last Courthouse break in set the

1351
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,780
alarm off

1352
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,260
um deputies arrived bonded to it

1353
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,760
verified us called the state they said

1354
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,319
hey they're working for us we were all

1355
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,480
good to go deputies let us go then the

1356
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,420
sheriff arrived and police start turning

1357
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,520
off their body cameras you know the

1358
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,160
sheriff is visibly upset you know at

1359
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,720
some point causes and says this is

1360
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,819
 the state can't do this you

1361
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:28,920
guys are going to go to jail and then he

1362
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,260
pressed charges against us came up with

1363
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,880
extended height and bails I think it was

1364
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,280
a hundred grand to bail us out and then

1365
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,740
was pressing charges for seven years of

1366
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,140
prison time for us for doing our job on

1367
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,300
behalf of the state because the sheriff

1368
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,400
said that's his courthouse and the state

1369
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,339
doesn't own it so a little bit of a big

1370
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:49,020
ego in a small town and that's that's

1371
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,760
kind of what it boils down to to me so

1372
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,339
nowadays we're doing our counter lawsuit

1373
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,720
um we're going ahead with that and then

1374
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,160
looking forward to giving you guys an

1375
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,960
update on how that went

1376
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,300
so I have a couple top exploit tools

1377
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,579
that we use one is latch bypass this is

1378
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,319
what we use to break into the bank that

1379
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,940
I mentioned earlier it's a flexible

1380
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,160
cutting board Lloyds and things like

1381
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,060
that

1382
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,040
can slip over the latch from the outside

1383
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,140
and that's what the purpose of the notch

1384
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,520
is instead of just pushing straight into

1385
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,140
the latch you know which way the latch

1386
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,400
is going to face there's a beveled Edge

1387
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,500
when the door closes automatically it

1388
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,599
hits that curve the door can close so we

1389
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:22,980
have to get around that and pull that

1390
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,599
latch that'll open the door that way

1391
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:27,060
there's other tools for this and there's

1392
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,500
a way to remediate this this really

1393
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,760
shouldn't be happening it's pretty easy

1394
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,920
to prevent it if the auxiliary dead

1395
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,839
latch is working properly that little

1396
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,540
component in red it's tough because it's

1397
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,859
like kind of a rubber Belling pad at

1398
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:39,420
your head what keeps the door closed is

1399
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,220
the primary latch that extends into the

1400
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,780
strike cavity that's where if you go and

1401
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,700
pull in the door what's jamming it up is

1402
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,020
the latch extended in there and that's

1403
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,339
not going to retract

1404
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:49,680
the auxiliary dead latch needs to be

1405
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,180
depressed right so you have one that's

1406
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,800
inserting the cavity the other one needs

1407
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,660
to hit the wall needs to hit the uh the

1408
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,160
door jam the door frame and stay

1409
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,440
depressed and that dead ends the primary

1410
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,880
latch so you can't just come in there

1411
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,280
and scrape that primary latch aside if

1412
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,960
you're able to push that door in and get

1413
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,119
that auxiliary pin to extend as well

1414
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:08,280
it's disengaged then you can bypass and

1415
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,099
that happens all the time what I prefer

1416
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:12,540
to see instead of seeing the ones that

1417
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,640
are in line like this get the ones that

1418
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,619
are vertical and then you only have your

1419
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,420
strike cavity that sits just in line

1420
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,300
with the latch and then it's just the

1421
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,740
entire rest of the door is where the

1422
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,480
auxiliary latch hits and that's a easy

1423
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,520
way to prevent that so

1424
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,960
I don't think I have an example maybe

1425
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,819
like kind of like where the screw holes

1426
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:31,619
are and the other mechanism there that's

1427
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:32,880
where your strike latch should be hit

1428
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,440
and just something lower like away from

1429
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,940
the cavity and then it's so hard with

1430
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,099
building settling or maintenance over

1431
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:40,740
time for that to go wrong

1432
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,400
um

1433
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,900
the other exploit tool that I'm going to

1434
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,339
use invariably is going to be the under

1435
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:45,780
the door tool

1436
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,339
um the common theme Here is tool

1437
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:49,560
insertion anytime we're able to insert a

1438
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,940
tool onto the other side of the door we

1439
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,740
can manipulate mechanisms

1440
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,140
um like ADA compliance States you got to

1441
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,400
be able to egress quickly from a

1442
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,980
facility because in most facilities

1443
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,119
preservation of life is far more

1444
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:02,160
important than the security and then

1445
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,660
with that you can't have a fire where

1446
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,220
people are scrambling have to find the

1447
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,079
key to unlock the door you can pull from

1448
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:09,480
that authenticated trusted side and

1449
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,819
bypass it that way and third top

1450
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,920
favorite tool would be RFID I consider

1451
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,480
this one to be the only tool that I

1452
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,000
cannot Source abroad or in the field so

1453
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,500
wherever I am drop there without any

1454
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,300
tools you can find everything in your

1455
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,940
house Home Depot what have you RFID is

1456
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,260
the only one where you need specialized

1457
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,079
circuitry to make this happen that's

1458
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,540
used for cloning there's other tools you

1459
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,160
can use that embed into the reader like

1460
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,359
we talked about

1461
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,599
uh and that's that so 3D printing I made

1462
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:38,400
a couple tools here for the industry one

1463
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,859
is a linear Access Control uh key to

1464
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:42,900
light key it's the a126 there's other

1465
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,460
tools that can hold your shims some

1466
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,920
bypass tools and picks shims are crazy

1467
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,240
because man you just like try to keep

1468
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,560
those in your pocket anytime you reach

1469
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,180
for anything they're just exploded so

1470
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,339
staying maintained and tight on an

1471
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:55,140
operation

1472
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,819
um it's it's ideal so I made a tool that

1473
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:59,280
helps with that everyday carry I

1474
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,359
encourage if you guys are interested

1475
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,819
carry lock picks they're not illegal I

1476
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,260
think like one state like Tennessee has

1477
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,119
some restrictions but their TSA approved

1478
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,460
I carry the sear pick wallet in the

1479
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,599
bottom left I don't think they make

1480
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,280
those anymore so I'd opt for the top

1481
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,780
right just a little sleeve that you can

1482
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,000
insert in your wallet purse what have

1483
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,819
you top left is the cover instruments

1484
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:19,980
covert companion and that has a ton of

1485
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,800
little bypass Tools in it really I get

1486
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,020
by with picks in the hall pass there in

1487
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,579
the middle and beyond that the only

1488
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,800
thing I long for would be your flexible

1489
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,720
shim that your metal can't go straight

1490
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,740
around you know you need something

1491
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,940
flexible to reach around the curve of

1492
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,280
the door some sometimes into UDT the

1493
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,260
under the door tool outside of that lock

1494
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,940
picks in that Hall Pass are all I need

1495
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,400
you can also use flexible shims like

1496
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,040
this and just keep two minutes guys wrap

1497
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,940
it up

1498
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,220
uh just a flexible shim like this sheet

1499
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,839
of metal that you can fold up and then

1500
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:49,980
you can keep that in your wallet to

1501
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,560
bypass uh padlocks as well

1502
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,540

1503

00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,079
someone has a question

1529
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,280
do we follow up with the engagements

1530
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,960
after 12 months typically only if we're

1531
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,579
doing another red team we have a renewal

1532
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:02,099
with that client otherwise I try to work

1533
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:03,660
with my clients they have a question how

1534
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,099
something worked but then they have

1535
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:06,660
their contractors in so we say hey the

1536
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,980
store had this vulnerability find

1537
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,480
yourself a locksmith that can remediate

1538
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,000
that and hopefully you're good to go

1539
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,859
um yeah there should be more I mean just

1540
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:15,420
like compliance stuff just like virtual

1541
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,859
penetration testing we should be

1542
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:18,300
following up more but it typically comes

1543
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,040
you know monetary standpoint gotta do

1544
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,940
another engagement with them
