Francisco is a gorgeous City and I'm so

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,340
grateful to have all of you here on your

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,619
Sunday in a dark theater with me instead

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,599
of out there enjoying the scenery

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,640
today we are talking about social

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,600
engineering ctfs for fun to a job as a

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,719
professional red team social engineer

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,880
um I've titled this talk Halt and Catch

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,120
Fire because it's going to

17
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,059
connect back to a bunch of themes in a

18
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,640
popular television show by the same name

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,680
that said you don't have to have watched

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,239
the show to appreciate the content I

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,980
hope but I do absolutely recommend that

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,140
you check it out so today we'll have a

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,920
brief introduction uh talks around the

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,940
themes of ambition competition

25
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,360
collaboration ambition and

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,659
Innovation and finally a conclusion

27
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,960
so introduction who the heck am I if you

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
are here you may know uh but I am most

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,780
well known for possessing a Defcon black

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,860
badge from winning the social

31
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,540
engineering Capture the Flag contest

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,080
back in 2019. I also have a trace Labs

33
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,420
black badge for myself and my team

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,520
winning the trace Labs missing persons

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,960
oceans CTF at Defcon 2020. I'm a keynote

36
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,960
speaker featured in Der Spiegel magazine

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,439
as well as the Wall Street Journal uh

38
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,200
bust magazine episode 107 of the darknet

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,040
Diaries and I am a US Army Special

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,500
Operations trainer presenting social

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,500
engineering to a group of folks who work

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,939
on those teams

43
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,899
and finally I went from scctf contestant

44
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,439
hopeful to Bishop Fox red team in just

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,380
about four years exactly and so this

46
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,840
talk will cover a little bit about how

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,380
that transition happened but just to go

48
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,080
back to the basics Halton Catch Fire is

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,120
a term that refers to a hardware air

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
condition an early computer systems

51
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,340
where the CPU would stop executing

52
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,900
instructions and potentially cause

53
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,840
physical damage due to overheating or

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,819
electrical overload

55
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,800
it is also as previously mentioned my

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,300
favorite show

57
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,800
um so this show has four essential

58
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,840
characters all of whom I relate to in

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,940
different ways and they connect to each

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,959
one of the themes that we'll be

61
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,599
discussing today and how those resonate

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,860
in my career the journey to now uh what

63
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,599
social engineering meant to me when I

64
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,239
started competing what it's evolved to

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,519
and where I think social engineering is

66
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,000
going in the future

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,480
so the thing that gets you to the thing

68
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,920
uh is really something that I try to

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,360
acknowledge with everything that I'm

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
doing this is not the stopping point

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,700
this is just part of the journey

72
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,120
and on the way to where I am now I was

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,400
extremely ambitious

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,760
I have not always been this confident

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,480
and I am by no means confident but I

76
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,180
have been adulting from a very young age

77
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,340
I also dropped out of college around the

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,459
age of 19 and managed to work my way

79
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,920
into a title officer position in the

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,800
escrow and title industry by the age of

81
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,720
22 which is the highest non-management

82
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,819
position on that side of the business

83
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,519
I was both married and divorced by the

84
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,280
age of 25 reinvented myself at the age

85
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,379
of 26 and 30 and 32 and 36 so there's

86
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,480
always room for evolution in your

87
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,239
journey and let me be an example of that

88
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,959
at uh the time in my early 20s I really

89
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,180
felt that the best security was that

90
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,860
trust no one ever no exceptions but over

91
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,739
time my viewpoint on that has changed

92
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,980
and this is kind of a story that relates

93
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,959
to how that Evolution occurred within me

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,879
but also in my perception of social

95
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,680
engineering and what that means to this

96
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,760
industry

97
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,519
so personally perhaps a smidge is too

98
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,840
ambitious at about the age of 26 I got

99
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,940
married again had four kids within less

100
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,340
than 10 years worked a full-time job the

101
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,080
entire way through became a chicken

102
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,300
farmer if you follow my Instagram I

103
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,979
apologize in advance

104
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:37,520
um so businesses I co-founded an itm SP

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,440
a voice over IP phone service company

106
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,520
and a security consulting firm I fell in

107
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,759
love with this industry through the

108
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,040
necessity that the voice over IP Service

109
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,699
Company created the necessity to protect

110
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,800
our clients their Communications data

111
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,979
and sensitive conversations I fell

112
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,620
absolutely head over heels with social

113
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,620
engineering and

114
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,560
ended up making a transition into this

115
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,520
industry from a variety of previous jobs

116
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,960
and

117
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,020
found competition and my ADHD brain said

118
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,880
yes

119
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,600
so when it comes to competition well you

120
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,340
gotta just grab your balls and jump

121
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,820
right so I found the social engineering

122
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,820
Village at Defcon they had a competition

123
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,479
called the SEC TF or Vishing competition

124
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,039
as it's now known

125
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,680
and this is not that story I'm not going

126
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,479
to tell that again if you'd like to know

127
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:40,919
more about that absolutely check out

128
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,780
that episode of the dark net Diaries

129
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,660
which goes very deep into my experience

130
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,300
competing in that competition and the

131
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,759
success that I had going from Hopeful to

132
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,039
contestant first time and then

133
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,500
eventually winning that competition in

134
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,320
my second attempt

135
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,100
the difference between competition and

136
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,020
the reality of social engineering was

137
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,780
something that I had no concept of when

138
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,120
I began competing and I actually was

139
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
featured as the person who's done

140
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,039
contests in a panel at derbycon years

141
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,320
ago to discuss the difference between

142
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,919
what fishing was like for realsies for

143
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,800
paid clients versus that contestant

144
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,539
experience which I felt that I'd

145
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,979
mastered and therefore of course I was

146
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,479
going to do fine like the professional

147
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,960
stuff the competition is really

148
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,940
high energy there's a lot of pressure

149
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,280
there's the lights there's the

150
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
excitement of the crowd and there's that

151
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,020
Applause that validation that comes

152
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,300
externally from the audience when you do

153
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,220
something well or their support when you

154
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,360
do something

155
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,740
bad and so that really feeds that desire

156
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,840
and that excitement to continue to do

157
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,699
those types of competitions and to get

158
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,860
involved in social engineering and it's

159
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,000
probably one of the most popular

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,699
questions that I get like how do I do

161
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,500
what you do for a living and I'm like

162
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,780
well I don't even do what I do for a

163
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,020
living so I don't know

164
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,580
the reality of social engineering is

165
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,680
that there are no lights

166
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,240
um there's a lot of self-imposed

167
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,199
pressure and there's a lack of that

168
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,560
external validation and that credit for

169
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,740
doing the thing good ER

170
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,380
than you expected or the ability to

171
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,160
really reach out and get support and

172
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,660
acknowledgment for your success because

173
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,460
of course everything must be done in the

174
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,720
secret

175
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,120
and the Darkness of night when you're

176
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,620
working in the context of client

177
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,440
engagements so for me it was a big shift

178
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,380
because I felt like I was continuously

179
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,960
putting tons of pressure on myself to

180
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,840
win which is exactly the wrong way to

181
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,759
look at it when you're working in the

182
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,639
context of client projects

183
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,580
so at this point we'll talk a little bit

184
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,740
about collaboration and that theme as it

185
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,139
relates to this evolution of the

186
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,900
discovery of what is social engineering

187
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,340
for clients

188
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,120
and I decided that I would start my own

189
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,160
thing because it turns out most of the

190
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,039
people hiring for people with the skill

191
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,259
of Social Engineering also want a

192
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,419
full-scale pen tester which I was not at

193
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:19,379
the time

194
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,319
so I started my own consulting firm and

195
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,319
I did have a very limited reach in the

196
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,620
local area where I was based this became

197
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,860
extremely dependent on me to run all the

198
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,419
functions of all the things everything

199
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,339
from billing and invoicing to selling

200
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,500
and marketing and building this brand

201
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,140
and so that became very quickly the

202
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,940
focus and it's probably the reason why

203
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,039
you saw me in 28 different conference

204
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,620
talks and various other trainings the

205
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,420
year first year of the pandemic when

206
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,060
everything was virtual

207
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,700
so everything that I could have learned

208
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,580
to become a better social engineer was

209
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,980
being done by people who were

210
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,080
technically my competitors and nobody

211
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,660
wants to share their secret sauce so I

212
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,180
was very very limited in opportunities

213
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,240
for growth however I did manage to do a

214
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,980
number of projects on the side of my

215
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,860
full-time gig and one of which was a

216
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,720
utility company that hired me to do

217
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,880
in-person security awareness in Social

218
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,220
Engineering training and then I relied

219
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,320
very heavily on white labeling and

220
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,920
reselling other vendors who had the you

221
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,899
know Content Library and the capability

222
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:31,560
to run email phishing campaigns kind of

223
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,140
out of the box in a more simplistic way

224
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,940
because I didn't have the development

225
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,000
capabilities to make those myself and I

226
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,380
was grappling with how to structure

227
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,480
these Services how to price them how to

228
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,880
sell them how to make it meaningful to

229
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,980
the client and I realized

230
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,320
this really isn't useful to this company

231
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,600
I've sold them this other service

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,940
there's no one to lead this I'm not

233
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,279
going to be here to hold their hand how

234
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,660
am I helping I don't feel like I'm

235
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,380
helping at all

236
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,040
there are two things that destroy

237
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,380
companies mediocrity and making it about

238
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,300
yourself and I felt like this was going

239
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,580
in that direction and I didn't really

240
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,920
like it but I knew that I wanted to be

241
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,540
in security and I knew that I needed to

242
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,580
get out of the Staffing industry where I

243
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,260
was working in Market intelligence so I

244
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,000
ended up joining a medium-sized

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,380
Consulting uh arm of a smaller

246
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,300
mdr-focused business and doing a

247
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,220
security awareness training for them as

248
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,959
well as security assessments against a

249
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,420
variety of different Frameworks this was

250
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,000
really Limited in the ability for me to

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,100
do social engineering within the context

252
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,200
of work outside of like just having

253
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,760
people tell me things in security

254
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,560
assessments and feeling comfortable to

255
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,839
do that but I did manage to work with

256
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,060
our offensive security team to do a

257
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,779
number of projects that focused on

258
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,700
pen testing with the incorporation of

259
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,500
social engineering and what ended up

260
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,019
happening was there were a lot of

261
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,300
clients that just knew that they needed

262
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,860
some fishing but they weren't really

263
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,980
sure how to get there and they weren't

264
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,899
really sure what that looked like for

265
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,360
their organizations so they would say

266
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,040
you know we only have 25 people we're

267
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,860
all very tight-knit we don't really know

268
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,120
where to start but we know we should

269
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,100
have some kind of social engineering

270
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,019
stuff so maybe like you can do a

271
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:18,180
training and then we can do a fishing

272
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,560
campaign and like see if they learn

273
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,120
things

274
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,339
and what I learned was that you know

275
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,720
coming from an email marketing

276
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,980
background I did well creating uh emails

277
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,260
that were encouraging of that you know

278
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,820
call to action and getting people to do

279
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,839
the thing

280
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,060
but I also noticed that regardless of

281
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,060
how well I trained the employees that I

282
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,320
was testing someone always failed and so

283
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,440
while we were testing the humans we were

284
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,480
actually bypassing all of their email

285
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,519
filtering all of the technical controls

286
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,440
that would prevent social engineering in

287
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,640
the first place

288
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,360
uh and so this was very limited in what

289
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,839
value it actually added to the clients

290
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:02,700
their experience their understanding of

291
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,800
their vulnerabilities to social

292
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,140
engineering attacks and it felt like

293
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,000
everything else in the project kind of

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,920
happened before the social engineering

295
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,980
was considered to be a thing and it kind

296
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,300
of got left behind so things were

297
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,000
happening in reverse and the value and

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,160
the benefit that this type of testing

299
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,040
offered to the client was basically null

300
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,560
what did we learn from this we learned

301
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,399
that people are people

302
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,680
to play an honest game you have to be

303
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,779
good at solving puzzles but to cheat you

304
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,120
have to be great at solving code and

305
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,300
that I was not so I had a giant puzzle

306
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,279
on my hands and no real way to solve it

307
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,920
and then I had to do that one Hospital

308
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,740
job this was probably the closest thing

309
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,040
I'd experienced to date to a real red

310
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,300
team project and the goal was for me to

311
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,459
support my offensive security testing

312
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,519
team in their efforts to compromise this

313
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,260
Hospital while they deployed on site and

314
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,820
I worked remotely

315
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,040
and what ended up happening was once

316
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
again communication broke down the team

317
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,480
was doing all of the technical testing

318
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,360
without engaging or using me as a

319
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,420
resource and the phishing and fishing

320
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,279
that was included in the scope of the

321
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,620
project got left as an afterthought to

322
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,700
the end

323
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,160
and this was not something that pleased

324
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,019
the client and

325
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,440
justified in that feeling 100 percent

326
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,260
so it wasn't easy as easy as it sounded

327
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,800
to incorporate those different levels

328
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,600
into this Black Box supposed to be a

329
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,120
simulation of a real Attack project that

330
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,399
we had committed to delivering there was

331
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,920
a huge deficit in planning coordination

332
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,339
communication and timing and it was

333
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,600
something that none of the Consultants

334
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
involved in the project myself included

335
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,160
were prepared to lead or to organize

336
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,480
from that standpoint and at that level

337
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,420
so I decided that this was a time for

338
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,680
innovation

339
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,500
I also decided that

340
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,459
this firm wasn't going to be the best

341
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,700
place for me to try to do the thing that

342
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,860
I wanted to do it was an amazing

343
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,360
stepping stone I learned so much

344
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,279
especially from doing security

345
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,380
assessments and from being exposed to

346
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,560
that more blue team focused type of

347
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,440
organization and the experience there I

348
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,300
would never trade for anything but me

349
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,839
trying to fit their blue team peg into

350
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,260
this Square red team offensive security

351
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,079
hole that I wanted to work with was just

352
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,699
not going to happen

353
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,199
so

354
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,839
I decided to go dark

355
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,360
authenticity is what inspires people if

356
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,040
you want to lead people you have to show

357
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,440
them who you really are otherwise you're

358
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,940
just a thousand dollar suit with nothing

359
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,279
inside and that's how I felt I felt like

360
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,440
I was wearing a blue team jacket and all

361
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,079
of this offensive security uh

362
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,000
identification of vulnerabilities and

363
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,120
threats and just being constantly on

364
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,940
edge which is just the nature of being

365
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,699
somebody who looks for those gaps and

366
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:19,079
looks for ways to uh you know get ahead

367
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,839
of any attack that could be a problem in

368
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,820
the future if not exploit it yourself in

369
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,320
the context of a salad that's signed and

370
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,440
that's legal uh and ethical uh was just

371
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,060
one of those things that I couldn't make

372
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,040
myself a blue tumor and like to be

373
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,480
honest like it's way harder than

374
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,899
attacking the things so I ended up

375
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,540
transitioning to a firm that is a large

376
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,839
consultancy the focus is on offensive

377
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,980
security testing exclusively and I had

378
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,740
the ability to test clients with much

379
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,199
more mature Security Programs who were

380
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,660
ready for that next step in the

381
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,339
evolution of social engineering which is

382
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:59,579
where I wanted to be and these clients

383
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,320
were in the market to buy those things

384
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,480
and it was justifiable for them to spend

385
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,279
the budget on these types of services

386
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,279
whereas with the smaller less mature

387
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,440
organizations it didn't make sense to

388
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,440
buy even the most basic fishing Services

389
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,100
let alone hire an organization to put

390
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,040
together a really robust customized red

391
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,860
team engagement that was supported by

392
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,380
social engineering at this firm the

393
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,959
opportunities to be creative abounded

394
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,660
and there were a bunch of amazing people

395
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,139
for me to learn from as well as me being

396
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:36,420
able to for the first time meaningfully

397
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,000
contribute to an organization doing the

398
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,839
stuff that I love to do and adding to

399
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,300
that innovation in Social Engineering as

400
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,399
well as redacted things I will hopefully

401
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,560
be sharing with you soon

402
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,800
uh so I wanted to build something that

403
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,720
makes people fall in love I wanted to

404
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,779
create a service line that made sense

405
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,139
the genuinely added value to Security

406
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,660
Programs and the advancement of those

407
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,480
programs how do we make the security

408
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,939
program and the defenses of an

409
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,339
organization against social engineering

410
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,140
improved

411
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,240
through our services that we offer

412
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,760
that's the real question if we're just

413
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,939
jumping through compliance uh check box

414
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,480
marks to make sure that we are

415
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,160
satisfying the requirements of a

416
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,740
compliance function we're not actually

417
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,840
benefiting the organization or

418
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,299
protecting them it's all that security

419
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:36,559
theater nonsense

420
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,340
so I tried to rush through this a little

421
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,900
bit so I could talk more about that one

422
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,940
physical assessment and this is where I

423
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,360
think that this story comes full circle

424
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,260
because this client has a very mature

425
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,419
security program they have invested the

426
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:55,080
money where it makes the most sense and

427
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,600
they have quarterly red teams to make

428
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,360
sure that we can help validate the

429
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,640
budget and the security controls that

430
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,740
they are putting in place both the

431
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,320
technical and the physical so I was

432
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,539
pulled into a project to test the

433
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:12,720
physical things at one location they had

434
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,860
a revolving doorman traps and Optical

435
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,480
turnstiles badge and badge out on

436
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,940
everything and I think I sat outside of

437
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,940
this building stressing out about how I

438
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,280
was going to gain access to it for well

439
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,840
over 90 minutes like to the point where

440
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,340
it's probably uncomfortable about how

441
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,860
long that this potentially an employee

442
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,179
has been sitting outside of the building

443
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,120
pretending to be on her phone on lunch

444
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,460
so I decided it's now or never but the

445
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,840
security controls that they had in place

446
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,340
were all the things that we put in the

447
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,100
reports that the clients never buy and

448
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,539
they had them

449
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,100
so the only way I was going to get in

450
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,799
was if another employee scanned their

451
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,740
badge for me so I decided I am going to

452
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,240
wait until there's a group of people

453
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,980
that are coming into the building I will

454
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,299
insert myself into the middle of that

455
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,000
group and I will make myself an obstacle

456
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
to them gaining access to the building

457
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,100
themselves and then try to look like a

458
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,020
hot mess and hopefully I can gain enough

459
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,780
empathy from those people to scan their

460
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,760
badge for me and I was like this is

461
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,280
going to be fine no it's not so I put

462
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,419
myself in the middle of a group of

463
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,100
people unfortunately there were two man

464
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,200
traps so some people just went around me

465
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,539
and finally I had someone that was

466
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,820
curious enough to ask what was going on

467
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,539
and then almost empathetic enough to

468
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,419
skin their badge for me and as they were

469
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,220
reaching to do it they saw the security

470
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,780
guard through the glass and went

471
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,240
actually you should probably talk to him

472
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,880
and I went or not I'm good I can just

473
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,460
I'll go around to the lobby so I ended

474
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,260
up walking away and the security guard

475
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,900
came out and he said uh

476
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,440
and I said oh no and so he brought me

477
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,059
inside and I gave him the whole I'm just

478
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,160
a new employee it's my second day this

479
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,380
badge doesn't seem to be working and I

480
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,160
thought for sure that he had totally

481
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,200
figured out what was going on and that

482
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,400
my cover was blown so I ended up blowing

483
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,160
my own cover by not pivoting correctly

484
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,600
in the moment and asking him to take me

485
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,360
to HR which was the goal but we ended up

486
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,100
writing a report that made the client

487
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,220
extremely happy they were very grateful

488
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,260
to have validated that their security

489
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,080
controls worked that the humans on their

490
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,559
security team worked and did their jobs

491
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,140
that the physical man traps worked and

492
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,120
that the people who I had tried to

493
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,940
exploit in my desperation had also done

494
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,280
their jobs to keep me out and followed

495
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,400
procedure uh but then they had this

496
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,679
other location and the short long and

497
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:41,880
short of it is they were trying to gain

498
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,400
budget to put more uh comprehensive

499
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,520
security controls in place there and my

500
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,200
co-worker and I were able to prove that

501
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,020
we could steal about 10 of the 13 trucks

502
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,840
that we recorded video of Us opening the

503
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,940
doors and finding keys and cup holes and

504
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,840
ignitions so there's a balance and uh I

505
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,280
think that opportunity to see the lesson

506
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,660
and where the success of that engagement

507
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,840
came from it wasn't me winning it wasn't

508
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,520
me going haha I could have stolen like

509
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,799
10 of these trucks it was validating

510
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,980
those expensive very expensive security

511
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,799
controls for the client and having them

512
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,980
feel like them bringing us on to test

513
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,440
them was worthwhile and it added benefit

514
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,419
to their security program and it

515
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,860
established that they were going in the

516
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,200
right direction

517
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,520
so in conclusion

518
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,200
the hardest things in life uh

519
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,820
essentially is to get knocked down and

520
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,980
have to get back up and being able to

521
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,140
accept when you were on a slightly wrong

522
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,799
path for you or that maybe this path

523
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,400
isn't the destination and adjust and get

524
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,100
back up and try again is critical to

525
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,600
success I feel in this industry

526
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,820
especially where you could get a job

527
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,380
doing the thing you actually don't want

528
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,960
to do uh probably nine times out of ten

529
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,419
with that first Roll But end up using

530
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,740
that to Pivot into the thing you

531
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,559
discover that you love

532
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,020
uh the evolution of social engineering

533
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,320
is key to creating opportunities for

534
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,500
benefit to clients in the advancement of

535
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,020
their Security Programs we can't keep

536
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,500
doing the same fishing whitelisted

537
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,860
domains baloney testing we need to take

538
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,400
this beyond that to add True Value to

539
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,900
our clients

540
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,200
and essentially I'm invested in finding

541
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,600
out what that Evolution looks like what

542
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,880
does this look like for our industry

543
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,240
going forward and how do we grow this

544
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,200
side of the business to add support to

545
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,360
engagements that make clients feel like

546
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,760
they made the right decision purchasing

547
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,299
them rather than yep we did the thing we

548
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,760
got the pen test check the box and let's

549
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,780
move on how do we improve programs and

550
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,480
go beyond raising awareness to really

551
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,240
finding what technical controls will

552
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,120
prevent phishing and how to gain budget

553
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,400
for those and Implement those in

554
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,039
organizations throughout the nation and

555
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,440
around the world
