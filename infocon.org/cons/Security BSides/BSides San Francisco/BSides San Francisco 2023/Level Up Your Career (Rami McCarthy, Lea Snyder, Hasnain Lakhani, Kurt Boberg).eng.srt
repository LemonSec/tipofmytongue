1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
hi everyone this is level up your career

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,100
it's a panel on staff Plus Engineering

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,779
uh for those that somehow ended up in

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,280
this room and don't know staff

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,840
engineering is a role that happens

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,179
Beyond these sort of terminal senior

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,920
engineer role that happens in tech

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,560
companies and specifically an

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,880
interesting thing about the staff

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,800
engineer title the staff plus engineer

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,480
role is that it's often seen as a

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,500
completely different set of

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,080
responsibilities and skills and not just

14
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,539
uh sort of a logical continuation of

15
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,699
senior and as a result folks find it

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,560
hard to break into staff they find it

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,059
hard to switch roles once they're at the

18
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,280
staff level managers find it hard to

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,899
work with staff plus Engineers or hire

20
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,480
them and so we all had the opportunity

21
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,100
to work together and with Clint Gibbler

22
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,680
of tldr Sac II collect about a dozen

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,540
stories of Staff plus engineers and

24
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,820
advice on the role in the security

25
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,600
industry and thankfully uh these folks

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,360
were kind enough to panel today

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,360
um I'm Rami I'm a infrastructure and

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,820
Cloud security engineer at figma and

29
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,460
infrequent contributor to tldrsec with

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,920
me today we have Lee who is a principal

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,600
security engineer at Microsoft and

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,040
mostly has worked at companies that

33
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,760
start with a you can check out LinkedIn

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,920
for more information

35
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,479
she's also organizing a bunch of

36
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,159
security conferences including besides

37
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,840
Seattle and the Diana initiative which

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,460
are coming up soon if you like security

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,840
conferences

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,020
uh we also have hasnain who is currently

41
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,700
a software engineer at databricks and

42
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,080
we're excited to talk to him about the

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,880
sort of role of software engineering in

44
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,380
security

45
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,119
um and previously he was doing a lot of

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,860
work in fuzzing and dynamic analysis at

47
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,200
meta and finally Kurt is our final

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,820
panelist and Kurt is a security

49
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,060
researcher at the staff level at semgrab

50
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,420
uh who make a stack analysis tool and

51
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,540
his fun fact is that he likes Carnival

52
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,740
carnivorous plants

53
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,939
um so you know find him in the hallway

54
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,479
afterwards and ask him about that uh

55
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,759
without further Ado

56
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,259
um I want to do a little bit of audience

57
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,299
participation I can't see you so this is

58
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,280
mostly you participating with yourselves

59
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,520
enjoy uh just gonna do a quick show of

60
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,619
hands on a few things to to sort of get

61
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,239
a pull of the room and and help you all

62
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,560
look around and see who you're here with

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,959
so first off can I get a show of hands

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,280
and I'm going to include the panelists

65
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,319
here who here has spoken at a conference

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,940
before

67
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,560
wow that's a lot of hands one of the

68
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,540
best parts about b-sides right is we

69
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,580
have a lot of participants

70
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,920
um similarly who's published a blog post

71
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,340
of any kind

72
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,900
uh who's released or maintained an open

73
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,700
source project

74
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,920
awesome fewer hands there takes a lot of

75
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,700
work uh who here's been a manager

76
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,080
fair amount of managers in the room

77
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,940
great to see and then uh who has a

78
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,459
degree a college degree of any sort

79
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,220
who has a CS degree specifically or

80
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,500
maybe security right and who has

81
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,900
graduate degrees

82
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,400
so this is really great for me

83
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,620
especially because part of this panel is

84
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,879
all about having really different

85
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,300
profiles and experiences of security you

86
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,739
know Lee is a principal security

87
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,300
engineer has named a software

88
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,459
engineering and security and Kurt does

89
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,280
research so we're really excited to show

90
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,720
all the ways you can get into security

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,940
all the things you can do inside and

92
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,920
outside work to be successful and grow

93
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,260
your career

94
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,019
and really just uh talk a lot about this

95
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:23,640
role and hopefully get some questions

96
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,739
from you and follow up after

97
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,420
um you know we're all very happy to take

98
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,400
questions outside this talk as well if

99
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,140
you're stuck in your career looking to

100
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,480
get unblocked looking to figure out how

101
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,400
to succeed as a staff engineer or really

102
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
just sort of bond with other folks going

103
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,060
through those challenges

104
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,000
I guess for the first question I just

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,519
want to like say I in the Preamble I

106
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,280
said staff engineer is a different role

107
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
than just you know a Step Beyond senior

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,760
with different responsibilities and I

109
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,379
love to just like starting with Kurt

110
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,720
could I get just a little bit from each

111
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,819
of you on what you think about the staff

112
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,680
engineer role and like what makes it

113
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,000
different

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,819
uh sure I can start can folks hear me

115
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,200
okay yes cool awesome uh so kind of what

116
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,420
I see about staff Engineers can being

117
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,400
sort of a specialist Problem Solver is

118
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,340
kind of where I have kind of made my bed

119
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,680
and it's like I I focus on the things

120
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,199
that only I can do either via

121
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,899
combinations of experience or localized

122
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,880
equities or things of that nature and

123
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,979
then aggressively delegating down things

124
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,560
that don't require my attention to

125
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,440
people who can also do it and may

126
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,580
benefit

127
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,580
themselves from doing that task and

128
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,979
that is a skill that takes a while to

129
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:41,460
kind of generate imperfect and that last

130
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,139
bit's mentorship which I'm sure we'll be

131
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,699
touching on a lot here that's the name

132
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,639
sure uh can everyone hear me fine

133
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,360
cool

134
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,040
um so I think for me staff engineering

135
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,500
is really about ownership at the end of

136
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,699
the day

137
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,560
um I'm here to solve business problems

138
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,660
and move the company forward and part of

139
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,919
the role of Staff engineering is like

140
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,080
you're not allowed to take any excuses

141
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,940
you're signed up to help the org do

142
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,680
something you have to get it done um

143
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,120
whether that's getting your hands dirty

144
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,680
leading a team doing a lot of

145
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,020
collaboration project management it

146
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,280
doesn't matter that's the ownership that

147
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,660
we need to take to help move things

148
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,900
forward

149
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,060
okay I have a slightly different take

150
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,940
um so I think of it as this weird role

151
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,380
that's sort of a combination of

152
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,660
engineering and Technical program

153
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,639
management I think you have to be able

154
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,460
to like lead really large complex

155
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,340
problems and solve them and possibly on

156
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,000
your own and possibly like show to his

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,919
name's Point like business impact before

158
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,080
you can get more folks involved so I

159
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,580
think it's kind of an interesting sweet

160
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,560
spot but if you have both of those skill

161
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,820
sets

162
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,300
awesome thank you all and so we've right

163
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,240
mentioned that this is a role but it's

164
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,800
also importantly to a lot of people a

165
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,199
title and one thing I like to think

166
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,520
about because I'm sure we have people in

167
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,080
this room who might be doing this kind

168
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,639
of work without the title that goes

169
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,740
along with it and you know maybe there

170
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,660
are folks who have the title and don't

171
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,039
yet feel like they're doing the work and

172
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,720
I'm curious like

173
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
um maybe his name to start with you do

174
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,380
you think the title matters like do you

175
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,840
think there's impact to getting that

176
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,000
staff engineer title or is it more about

177
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,180
the work you do or some mix

178
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,220
um I think for me it's mostly about the

179
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,039
work I do but it varies a lot based on

180
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,060
company

181
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,800
um and my previous employer meta titles

182
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,660
or private so it was definitely easier

183
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,039
because you could show it and get like

184
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,360
recognition based on the work that

185
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,160
you've done but from what I've heard

186
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,960
from peers like you know if you work at

187
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,639
a company where titles are important

188
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,979
then like people do want to see you have

189
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,600
that title before they sort of let you

190
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
push forward in that role so I think it

191
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,400
is context dependent yeah and anyone

192
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,620
else have a thought there I have a

193
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,139
potentially lukewarm to spicy take on

194
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,620
this okay titles absolutely matter and

195
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,600
the people who tell you titles don't

196
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,419
matter have nice titles and nice

197
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,220
positioning within the industry this is

198
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,160
like almost universally true uh

199
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,500
especially for underrepresented folks in

200
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,900
the industry if you are anything beyond

201
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,340
what is considered like the industry

202
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,819
like default human you absolutely need

203
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,580
that title to be taken seriously in a

204
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,160
lot of rooms so absolutely title is

205
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,120
important

206
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,520
awesome yeah I guess I would say that

207
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,680
the title lets you in the room it's not

208
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,880
like you're doing any different

209
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,800
but you don't have to fight for that

210
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,819
place

211
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,380
um so that's why I think it matters so

212
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,479
but I agree with you it's it totally

213
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,620
matters

214
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,360
yeah and and being in the room is

215
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,979
something I feel like we all talk about

216
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,620
a lot and uh with that comes meeting

217
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,000
burden so

218
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,460
um maybe we'll touch on that in a bit uh

219
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,060
okay so you talked about mentorship Kurt

220
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,280
but as the reverse like I know you've

221
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,960
talked and thought a lot about how

222
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,759
sponsorship and mentorship helped you in

223
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,740
your journey to staff like could you

224
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,080
share a little bit about how managers

225
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,819
might be able to help someone or peers

226
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,000
or mentors get to this level sure so I

227
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,240
made it to a staff title and what is

228
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,580
arguably like record time I feel like

229
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,699
for the average is you know what seven

230
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,680
to ten years usually

231
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,160
I think I did it in seven flat might

232
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,039
have been six uh and this is largely

233
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,860
because I made all of my uh career

234
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,199
choices based on uh mentorship

235
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,919
opportunities my very first career job

236
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:27,599
uh was uh

237
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,139
a large e-signature company pre-ipo I

238
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,120
was offered two positions one was a

239
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,500
general engineering role and the other

240
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,899
one was with the hiring manager who did

241
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,880
my phone screen and I was like I don't

242
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,320
care about the job I want to work for

243
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,520
this person and that got me connected

244
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,740
with my next Mentor who is still a

245
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,260
mentor to me today and that got my my

246
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,000
next job after that where I built an

247
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,860
appsec program from scratch and that

248
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,360
connected me with Clint who got me my

249
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,459
current researcher job so I basically

250
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,880
like mentorship has built my career in

251
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,980
its entirety so picking like good

252
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,560
mentors is super super important and

253
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,500
unfortunately I don't really have any

254
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,519
concrete advice for you on how to find

255
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,560
those people it's kind of an you know it

256
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,540
when you see it type deal and come to

257
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,320
b-sides go to hallway con talk to people

258
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,580
I think that's all that's all I can give

259
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,200
you there yeah anyone else have

260
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,820
experiences of mentorship that maybe

261
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,140
unlocked something for you in your

262
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,459
career or

263
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,519
no Soul successes

264
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,860
yeah no and it's interesting because

265
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,540
like that's what this is all about which

266
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,360
is I think mentorship can unlock career

267
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,040
opportunities and also you can make

268
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,080
opportunities for yourself and and be

269
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,760
successful

270
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,820
um can you maybe starting with Lee talk

271
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,500
about how you see your roles as a staff

272
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,779
engineer now the other direction giving

273
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,000
mentorship and giving sponsorship and

274
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,519
what that might look like yeah so I mean

275
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,080
I totally agree that mentorship and

276
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,019
sponsorship can open doors and any

277
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,940
chance you get to do to help someone you

278
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,440
should

279
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,660
um I do a lot of mentoring I probably do

280
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,640
too much

281
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,200
um honestly like I will always sign up

282
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,120
if someone reaches out even people I

283
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,740
don't know I'm happy to like do those

284
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,480
conversations I just think it's so

285
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,519
critical to people's success and I wish

286
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,160
I had had mentors and sponsors and I

287
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,959
didn't so for me it's really important

288
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,240
to give back to open the door for

289
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,779
someone else

290
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,040
um so I I got a bit of both of these

291
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,480
points I think for me mentorship was

292
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,640
critical in getting where I am

293
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,320
um but at the same time so I try to give

294
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,240
back like we suggested I think one of

295
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,480
the key areas I found is like you want

296
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,279
to find people that are hungry for

297
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,920
mentorship and will like respect your

298
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,080
time but also put in the work

299
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,820
um there's

300
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,620
um a lot you can do then you can see

301
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,480
those people honestly outstripping you

302
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,800
and doing way better than you could ever

303
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,420
do in your own time and that feeling is

304
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,700
just something like you can't beat and

305
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,140
like there's a lot of like really

306
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,700
amazing people out there in the field

307
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,800
and getting into the field and we have a

308
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,839
lot to do um as a senior folk in the

309
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,660
industry to help them grow

310
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,640
Curt anything on the other direction

311
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,399
uh just to add to the previous two

312
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,220
responses if you have someone like that

313
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,560
that you are mentoring and they are

314
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,700
hungry and they are putting in the work

315
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,279
you absolutely do owe it to them to like

316
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,980
go to the mat for them and uh I have a

317
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,200
current mentee who may or may not be in

318
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,420
the audience here who I have done this

319
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,500
for this week around like you know or

320
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,000
stuff and promotions and through that

321
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,519
and you have to like I am

322
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,279
due to my experience I have the

323
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,740
political pull and you know title and

324
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,600
all that stuff to be able to get into

325
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,100
those rooms to have those conversations

326
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,220
I owe it to this person to do that

327
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,720
yeah

328
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,459
um and so some of the things we're

329
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:45,720
talking about here are mostly

330
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,120
non-technical actually which I would

331
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,560
make a note of

332
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,940
um and

333
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,980
so some of the questions come up which

334
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,339
is like is this a non-technical role how

335
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:57,899
much is sponsorship and mentorship and

336
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,279
then what makes it different than being

337
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,220
a manager and actually like

338
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,260
last name you've managed folks and

339
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,180
you've come back the other way

340
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,360
um can you talk about maybe you know the

341
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,100
differences you found in those roles or

342
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,779
what you find compelling about right now

343
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,240
working maybe outside of management with

344
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,700
some of these responsibilities sure

345
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,160
um so I I will caveat by saying I was a

346
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,740
tlm or technical manager which is a bit

347
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,440
of mix of both when I was a manager do

348
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,120
you mind just explaining that to folks

349
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,380
who haven't worked at a company with

350
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,480
that role sure so I would say my

351
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,339
responsibilities were as a tech lead of

352
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,019
the team driving projects and stuff but

353
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,640
also having reports and doing the people

354
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,220
management aspect so bounded to a small

355
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,540
team

356
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,300
um I would say the main differences for

357
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,459
me like as a manager my focus was much

358
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,500
more on the people on supporting their

359
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,899
career growth on helping them find the

360
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,200
right projects and excelling as a team

361
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,420
but as a staff engineer it's a little

362
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,399
bit more on the technical side so sort

363
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,440
of I still work very closely with my

364
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,420
manager to ensure the people on the team

365
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,740
are getting the right feedback that

366
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,540
they're growing appropriately but

367
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,459
providing more technical input into the

368
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,620
direction of the team like I'd say the

369
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,360
main difference is like as a manager if

370
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,040
I'm doing the technical decisions I'm

371
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,320
doing it wrong but as an engineer if I'm

372
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,760
not doing any of the technical decisions

373
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm doing it wrong

374
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,800
awesome Kurt Lee have you considered

375
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,480
management like what what keeps you

376
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,240
working as an individual contributor so

377
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,519
I've done management

378
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,860
um and I do agree that a lot of the time

379
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,980
is spent you know coaching others uh the

380
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,420
interesting thing to me is

381
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,279
as a principal security engineer I spend

382
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,800
a lot of time coaching others so I I

383
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,540
think the main difference is I don't

384
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,920
have to write the performance review

385
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,279
which is thrilling to me personally

386
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:44,880
um

387
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,220
but I think it's honestly I do just as

388
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,399
much coaching and uh helping people

389
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,260
figure out their career paths as I did

390
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,579
as a manager

391
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,079
um why didn't I want to be a manager I

392
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,820
don't like doing perform like really it

393
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,980
comes down to that for me I just don't

394
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,860
like it I'd rather just drive strategy

395
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,860
and direction as an IC

396
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,740
I will plus one much of what Lee just

397
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,220
said I tried managing I was a terrible

398
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,480
manager uh so like some people are good

399
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,399
at the

400
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,399
paperwork part and like you know you

401
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,260
have to be a person with like super high

402
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,820
conscientiousness and like attention to

403
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,860
detail and stuff like that and my brain

404
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,180
doesn't work like the reason I'm a

405
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,500
researcher is because I go chase

406
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,899
butterflies down through like rfcs and

407
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,279
specifications and stuff like that like

408
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,139
that's why I have the job I have that

409
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,420
makes me a really bad manager because it

410
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,639
makes me super inconsistent

411
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,760
um I am happy to offer like career

412
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,420
Direction and some of that like you know

413
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,959
squishy political advice to mentees but

414
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,560
like can I help you do the like how to

415
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,779
climb the ladder at your current work no

416
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,160
not really like I can give you broad

417
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,320
strokes but like

418
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,620
I'm just bad at it so okay so maybe next

419
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,160
question not for Kurt uh that's namely

420
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,899
like one of the big things that happens

421
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:08,760
is folks find themselves stuck at senior

422
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,139
I think I was just having a conversation

423
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,779
last night with someone a manager

424
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,040
um who was talking about how their

425
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,139
report couldn't get that staff level

426
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,060
promotion right was doing the work and

427
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,500
wasn't getting the promotion and I'm

428
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,899
curious like as folks already already in

429
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,060
that role what would your advice be or

430
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,279
maybe how do you help folks navigate

431
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,260
that sort of

432
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,639
um blockage in their career progression

433
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,220
yeah so um oddly I was right there not

434
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,680
that long ago like just stuck at senior

435
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,079
being like so I've been doing principal

436
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,660
work can I can I have my promo thanks

437
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,579
um so like my suggestion is if you are

438
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,560
stuck own your own destiny right like

439
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,360
there are other people hiring if you're

440
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,339
doing the work and you have the body of

441
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,500
work and you can speak to it somebody

442
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,360
else is going to give you that role so

443
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,120
that's that was my approach it worked

444
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,940
out perfectly for me

445
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,339
um I think relatedly to add to that

446
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,920
um if you uh like for me I was also

447
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,500
stuck for a while and it was okay am I

448
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,360
doing staff level work

449
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,040
um is there something missing where I

450
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,720
think I'm doing staff level work but my

451
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,760
management chain or other folks don't

452
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,079
um that was one thing like just go and

453
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,820
ask for feedback like say okay hey what

454
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,139
am I missing

455
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,600
um once those expectations are clear

456
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,339
um try to like work towards them but

457
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:24,660
then also keep getting feedback and

458
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,820
holding yourself accountable like it is

459
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,100
not enough to just you know do the work

460
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,720
and ship a project but it's more about

461
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,160
the intangibles how do you get everyone

462
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,720
together how do you set a longer term

463
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,279
Vision than just doing the work you're

464
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,899
assigned because at the end of the day

465
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,279
as a staff engineer you're supposed to

466
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,199
drive bigger things forward than just

467
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,060
being given work to do

468
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,899
yeah and so um let's say there are folks

469
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,139
out there who are stuck at senior level

470
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,100
um you know they're trying to take

471
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,079
ownership of their Destiny they're doing

472
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,320
the work uh do you think that there's a

473
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,139
time at which you will be more

474
00:16:58,139 --> 00:16:59,639
successful getting that promotion by

475
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,139
leaving your job or do you think that

476
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,820
you're more successful sticking with a

477
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,099
job for that promotion because I know I

478
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,660
talk to all sorts of senior Engineers

479
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,119
who are really torn between investing in

480
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,559
the company they've worked at and built

481
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,660
this reputation and understanding that

482
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,280
maybe there isn't a path or a role for

483
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,720
them there

484
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,819
I think it depends on how patient you

485
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,059
are I'll admit I'm really impatient like

486
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,160
I'm wildly impatient like it's a huge

487
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,959
weakness for me

488
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,699
um and I wasn't willing to wait like I

489
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,100
just I finally said this is I'm not

490
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,600
going to stick around like I made that

491
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,520
very clear to my management it's what I

492
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
wanted

493
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,640
it's what I expected and when it didn't

494
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,940
come to fruition I was like I'm out and

495
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,740
that is a very honest conversation so

496
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,940
that's the other thing I would be very

497
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,460
honest with somebody about what you want

498
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,440
and how you want to grow you've got to

499
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,600
let that person know because otherwise

500
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,039
they may not even realize it's what

501
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,580
you're looking for

502
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,640
okay um

503
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,380
so something that's come up already a

504
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,760
little bit and I always am interested in

505
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,860
talking about is we talk about this

506
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,720
staff engineering role often in terms of

507
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
scope I think especially among staff

508
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,980
Engineers right uh if you're a senior

509
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,480
engineer maybe you're responsible for

510
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,760
work you do what team does as a staff

511
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,260
engineer it's normally an area of the

512
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,360
business right we're all at very

513
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,880
different sized companies and a team an

514
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,440
area of the business a product a

515
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,419
department is vastly different and I

516
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,400
don't know if uh maybe starting with Lee

517
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,900
who I think works at our largest

518
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,700
employer represented like do you think

519
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,460
there's a difference in the role at big

520
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,740
companies is it a difference in sort of

521
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,720
really seniority like as a staff

522
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,460
engineer at a tiny startup doing the

523
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,679
same job in the same way what's the

524
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,360
comparative well I mean I think it's

525
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,280
like the same comparison you have to a

526
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,020
small company versus a large company

527
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,419
right like they're they're different

528
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,580
beasts and there's different problems

529
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,679
the part reason that I work at very

530
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,860
large companies is I love the complexity

531
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,160
of the problems like they're really hard

532
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,799
um I love like getting to scale like

533
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,240
every time you're asking how do I scale

534
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,580
how do I scale how do I scale and it's

535
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,860
just for me a very different

536
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,400
um

537
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,100
like atmosphere and an environment I but

538
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,660
fundamentally I think it's just a you

539
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,100
know they're just different companies I

540
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,840
don't think one is better than the other

541
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,059
I don't think the role like I think each

542
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,400
staff engineer role is actually kind of

543
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,919
unique and is at a certain place at the

544
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:24,720
company that they they need that person

545
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,640
right and so

546
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,200
it's really I think it's really hard to

547
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,940
compare personally I don't know if you

548
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,320
guys have I mean you've worked at both

549
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,840
large and small companies so

550
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,360
yeah I'm happy to take a second pass I

551
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,340
just switched from a very large company

552
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,100
to a reasonably large company like

553
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,679
mid-size yeah

554
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,480
um so I think there's parts of the role

555
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,860
that stay the same and like you know as

556
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,240
a staff engineer you're on the hook for

557
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,120
business impact um and I think the it's

558
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,440
just the ways that you need to get those

559
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,760
done are different like at my previous

560
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,740
role it was you know

561
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,480
um leading a team of Engineers to build

562
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,340
software set the vision and then work

563
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,380
closely with our partners both within

564
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,240
our organ across different orgs to like

565
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,679
meet their needs

566
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,360
um and my current role our team is much

567
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,980
smaller um and we have a lot more things

568
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,200
to do so it's a lot more about

569
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,120
building relationships with teams where

570
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,620
we need to get them to do things on our

571
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,780
behalf understanding their roadmaps

572
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,100
understanding where we can contribute

573
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,780
and then building a lot more stuff on my

574
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,919
own

575
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,240
um but at the end of the day the north

576
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,620
star of like you know here's what the

577
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,299
company needs and I'm helping drive that

578
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,580
forward is what it's important yeah and

579
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,100
I mean Kurt you're in research like

580
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,780
you're almost a solver archetype which

581
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,100
is an archetype that sort of goes deep

582
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,260
on a single problem uh does this

583
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,520
resonate for you or is this just

584
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,340
divorced from your experience

585
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,220
my experience is complicated so my first

586
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,960
couple jobs were mid-sized company like

587
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,720
pre-ipo midsize company post IPO midsize

588
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,299
company and then

589
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:50,640
uh when I was hired at some crap it was

590
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,799
still under 50 people and I had known

591
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,000
most of the team since it was like 15

592
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,980
people so I went from you know mid-sized

593
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,419
Miss I to itty bitty teeny tiny company

594
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,280
so

595
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,220
the research part is like we're in a

596
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,559
space that has a bunch of like

597
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,660
big industry-sized problems that don't

598
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,600
have great Solutions like I I work on

599
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,520
the supply chain part of our product and

600
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,280
like based on the plethora of other

601
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,660
companies in the space trying to talk

602
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,400
about no one has like a silver bullet

603
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,900
yet like there's a reason there's 50

604
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,280
companies because there's like 50

605
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,860
different strategies and no one is a

606
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,039
clear winner yet really so

607
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:28,320
is kind of different

608
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,600
um and the other thing is based on

609
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,220
um even the two mid-sized companies I

610
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,799
was at had wildly different problems

611
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,480
that needed to solve be solved and

612
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,159
wildly different scaling problems just

613
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,140
based on like who their customers were

614
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,539
what their infrastructure was like how

615
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:45,299
old their code bases were relatively

616
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,640
like they're like speed of shipping and

617
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,860
there's just so many variables that like

618
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,900
staff engineer positions really are like

619
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,419
super super unique so I guess like a lot

620
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:55,860
of this like resonates like a little bit

621
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,200
but again I'm off in the weeds looking

622
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,640
for like solutions to problems we don't

623
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,460
like have solutions for so I don't know

624
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,640
I will stop there yeah so Kurt you

625
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,159
mentioned doing the supply chain product

626
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,200
is sort of a big research problem and

627
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,520
Lee you mentioned that there are like

628
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,980
this concept of big problems can I get

629
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,260
like Hassan Lee an example of what a big

630
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,299
problem is in your sort of Staff

631
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,900
engineering role whether currently

632
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,700
historically in uh whatever way you can

633
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,380
share it in this context

634
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,000
sorry I can take a stab so in my

635
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,580
previous role um I was basically working

636
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,740
on fuzzing um but the problem that we

637
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,179
were trying to solve was that we had

638
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,620
like member corruption bugs and native

639
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,059
code and that's sort of what we took

640
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,280
ownership of there was people attacking

641
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,600
that from different angles but we said

642
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,000
hey we do Dynamic analysis so fussing is

643
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,440
a natural fit for this

644
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,120
um but at the end of the day our Focus

645
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,000
was just on are we solving the end goal

646
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,340
of like reducing the lake attack surface

647
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,559
in Native by finding these bugs and

648
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,059
preventing them up front

649
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,220
yeah and so was that mostly Technical

650
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,320
Solutions was that mostly about getting

651
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,120
other teams to use your platform like

652
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,480
what's the shape of that um I would say

653
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,100
um technical Innovation so that we could

654
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,840
actually find it on like find those

655
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,360
types of bugs in our code bases and then

656
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,220
finding the people that could most

657
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,039
benefit from our steps it was on us to

658
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,360
like see okay which teams would most

659
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,220
benefit from the switch code bases were

660
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,240
most at risk and so on

661
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,260
yeah so

662
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,539
um I work on breach preparedness which

663
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,360
sounds simple Until you realize that

664
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,100
you're working with service teams who

665
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,480
doesn't sound simple I don't know if

666
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,580
anyone else just panicked but

667
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,740
um in my head it sounded simple when I

668
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,600
took the job maybe that maybe I should

669
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,159
reframe that

670
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,380
um so a lot of mine is looking at

671
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,720
tooling that will help understanding

672
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,460
like problems we have in our current

673
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,340
tools that create issues and then

674
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,760
process so it's it's a it's a weird

675
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,740
space to be in I'll be honest and I

676
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,080
think a lot of people are used to you

677
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,260
know blue teams practicing response

678
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,880
and I'm really much more interested in

679
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,380
how does a service team practice

680
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,320
response so that's how I spend my time

681
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,960
and I think we're maybe have the slido

682
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,799
stuff

683
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,059
Maybe

684
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,760
yeah yeah cool awesome

685
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,740
um we have more questions prepared but

686
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,600
like feel free to get some questions in

687
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,919
the slide out or if you can't figure

688
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,200
that out and I can see you in your in

689
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,400
the first four rows you can like throw

690
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,380
up a hand and yell at me

691
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,039
um

692
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,539
that being said I think the first

693
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,480
question that came in uh maybe I don't

694
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,460
know what order these are in is trying

695
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,340
to push us on a point that we sort of uh

696
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,900
skipped right over which is really no

697
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,179
how do you find mentors

698
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:40,440
um you know you're driven you're

699
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,299
interested in growing your career I

700
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,000
guess the way I would sort of add color

701
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,340
to this is do you think that you should

702
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,780
be looking for mentors inside your

703
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,940
company or outside do you think you

704
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,460
should be looking for mentors with your

705
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,320
specific role like is there a profile

706
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,500
you should look for do you DM them on

707
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,080
Twitter do you walk up to them at the

708
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,000
conference do you send them a cold email

709
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,980
like what advice can we actually give

710
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,100
people to help them get access to this

711
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,719
resource that exists in the community

712
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:14,400
I have a very long story time answer for

713
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,780
this if no one else wants do you have a

714
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,760
short story time answer for this I can

715
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,200
attempt to bridge this a bridge this

716
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,700
story time is all right I'll put you on

717
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,919
the clock all right tldr I have done all

718
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:25,919
of these things uh and with

719
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,700
reasonable success like uh I met uh

720
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,299
Alejandro Munoz and

721
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,400
why can't I remember his name we don't

722
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,559
do mentorship for the fame people yeah

723
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,879
any um

724
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,940
why the why so serial developer whose

725
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,480
name I'm forgetting anyway I met him and

726
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,520
uh Munoz and Alexander marosh at Defcon

727
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,200
27 just like and like talked

728
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,940
deserialization with for 45 minutes

729
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,360
because I ran into them at Defcon uh

730
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,980
I have messaged people on Twitter I have

731
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,539
um but the best advice I actually got

732
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:11,400
from my dad which when I started my like

733
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,140
big kid corporate job because he was

734
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,700
like go identify the people who are not

735
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,440
in leadership positions now but it'll be

736
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,299
in leadership positions in two to three

737
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:19,980
years because those people are still

738
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,159
accessible and they will have much more

739
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,380
power and influence when you need them

740
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,220
to

741
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,120
so what I did is when I started uh I met

742
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,100
the director of appsec and I just had

743
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,679
coffee with him literally every Monday

744
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,419
and we would just talk security I was

745
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:38,880
not in security at the time but like you

746
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,620
know we talk about off bypass Monday and

747
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,640
because

748
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,380
anyway uh different stories uh but that

749
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,059
like that is where I got one of my like

750
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,159
super Rock Solid mentorships I still

751
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,320
have to this day and that was like an

752
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,720
in-company thing so if you're in a large

753
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,460
enough organization to find these sorts

754
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,380
of people absolutely do go find the

755
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,659
people who are like one to two rungs

756
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,940
ahead of you on the like career ladder

757
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,799
because you can still have informal

758
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,240
conversations with them

759
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,299
and those and they will end up big

760
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,120
decision makers yeah like and when

761
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,260
you're in mid-career when you really

762
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,000
need this kind of mentorship so Kurt you

763
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,440
mentioned like 45 minutes of talking

764
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,299
gang coffee regularly if you're inside

765
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,880
the company also we're all in roles

766
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,500
where I think people put one-on-ones on

767
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,760
our calendar

768
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,440
um if you are not putting one-on-ones on

769
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,480
people's calendar you want to have a

770
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,820
bigger relationship with uh you should

771
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,679
just do that other people will

772
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:32,880
um you're falling behind if you're not

773
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,159
putting yourself out there but I think

774
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:36,659
what often gets people tripped up is

775
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:38,039
they have that first meeting and they

776
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,480
don't know how to turn that into a

777
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,340
relationship and I'm wondering if Saint

778
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,500
early you know like what is the next

779
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,000
step right you've met someone you think

780
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,039
is really interesting or really helpful

781
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,340
or insightful what do you do about it

782
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,159
um I'll make a first pass at this one

783
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,860
um I found it useful like say okay I am

784
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,840
meeting this person because I want to

785
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,120
learn X or grow my connections in

786
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,400
private why and I just talk about it

787
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,020
um I just like open up and say hey I'm

788
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,760
looking for advice in this area I want

789
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,799
to grow I am being respectful of your

790
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,020
time so what are things I can do for you

791
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,580
that'll help me learn more about this

792
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,260
field or that can help me grow and I

793
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,299
found that to be a good end especially

794
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,679
when I was like really Junior like

795
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,419
people would love to delegate and get

796
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:19,679
brand new points for that and get their

797
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,179
stuff done right

798
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,740
um so it's a win-win situation and then

799
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,200
over time you can just like you know be

800
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,600
like hey I wanted your advice on X as a

801
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,520
quick question it doesn't always have to

802
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,380
be a one-on-one or a long meeting it can

803
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,760
just be an email after a certain amount

804
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,080
of time and then that builds that

805
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,720
relationship for when you really need it

806
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,779
anything badly or like I guess you know

807
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,640
I think about the relationships I have

808
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,260
with folks who are mentoring and one of

809
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,820
the things that we tend to do at least

810
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,220
in the first meeting is we don't

811
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,799
actually talk about anything besides

812
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,960
just like what's going on what are your

813
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,760
interests what do you do like very much

814
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,220
break the ice because that gives you the

815
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,600
end to then have the follow-up

816
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,460
conversation

817
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,120
um

818
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,620
I have the only thing I would say about

819
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,140
the inside or outside the company I just

820
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,460
wanted to kind of touch on that if

821
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,080
you're at a large company I would say

822
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,640
it's absolutely essential to have

823
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,860
somebody who can go to bat for you so

824
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,299
it's the person who was terrible at it

825
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:13,679
for a long time but I do think it's

826
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,299
actually wise

827
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,039
um I also think it's really helpful to

828
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,720
have somebody outside the company to

829
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,340
give you a perspective because it's too

830
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,039
easy to have blinders on and just get

831
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,919
very sucked into your corporate culture

832
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:27,960
uh which is you know beneficial for

833
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,000
growing but you do need that other

834
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,340
perspective to grow even further so I

835
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,840
just wanted to do a plug for that yeah

836
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,159
someone actually asked a relayed

837
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,779
question which is

838
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:37,860
um

839
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,419
I think we're talking about mentorship

840
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:40,679
right now but we've also mentioned

841
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:43,860
sponsorship and inside your company like

842
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,140
is sponsorship ship signing you should

843
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,940
seek his sponsorship something you

844
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,220
should expect from your manager like

845
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,020
what's the role of sponsorship in your

846
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,039
growth in your career

847
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,360
um it's something you should expect from

848
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,860
a manager but realistically you're not

849
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,240
likely to get it and you should not like

850
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,799
wait for it to come around so it is

851
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,299
something you actively need to seek and

852
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,520
say okay hey I need someone to back me

853
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,980
up in this area or someone to like give

854
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,440
me Kudos in the room where it matters

855
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,480
where stuff I'm shipping

856
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,799
um and you want to set clear

857
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,559
expectations for that

858
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,659
awesome can I add something to that real

859
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,100
quick yeah of course this is absolutely

860
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,840
one of those you know when you see it

861
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,080
indicators like someone who is willing

862
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,179
to sponsor you and go to bat for you is

863
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,399
an indicator of an excellent manager and

864
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:30,960
mentor

865
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,960
awesome and I think we

866
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,760
um like you mentioned asking good

867
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,580
questions sort of following up

868
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,980
um and allowing your manager to like or

869
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,440
your mentor to delegate down

870
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,240
um but we had a related question right a

871
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,740
lot about mentorship here uh like

872
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,360
you all have a lot of people probably

873
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,100
seeking your mentorship or at least like

874
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,140
Lee I know you and I have talked about

875
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,220
sort of a lot of mentees and what what

876
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,080
is a like good mentees engagement look

877
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,360
like what's a good mentees sort of

878
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,080
contribution that relationship look like

879
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,340
um that's an interesting question I

880
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,260
think just come with like an openness to

881
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,659
learn and an engagement from like what

882
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:14,399
you want from that person this is

883
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,020
probably why I'm actually bad the

884
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,460
opposite direction is I I actually

885
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,500
didn't know what I wanted from the

886
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,779
people that were helping me

887
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,820
um like to do everything on my own I

888
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,559
seriously don't recommend that but like

889
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,120
just tell them what you're like be

890
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,399
really direct like I would like help you

891
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,080
know growing my technical skills I would

892
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,600
like help growing my you know leadership

893
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,480
skills like the folks at our level can

894
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,399
help you with both but we don't really

895
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,779
know what you need unless you tell us

896
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:43,279
like we cannot read your mind

897
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,000
and

898
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,220
um something I think Hussein mentioned I

899
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,380
always think about is like situations

900
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,320
and cases have you guys found that

901
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,240
um mentorship gets easier if someone's

902
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,220
bringing you like a specific problem or

903
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,460
situation or skill I know I found that

904
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,020
like a lot of times you get these

905
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,760
inbound emails that are like hey please

906
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,140
teach me security and just like yes read

907
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,380
tldr SEC and like come back to me with a

908
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,059
specific topic or question and I'm happy

909
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,220
to help but I'm wondering like have you

910
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,399
seen that sort of Realm of interaction

911
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:20,159
my current mentee brings a bolded list

912
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,980
to all of our one-on-ones and that is

913
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,419
incredibly helpful

914
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,820
because I'm yeah like I am here as a

915
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,340
resource but like I need you to guide me

916
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,480
with what you need from me because I can

917
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,159
Rabbit Hole down like let's talk about

918
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,940
the URL specification for an hour so you

919
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,500
need to ask me for what you what you

920
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,179
need

921
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:44,100
I would also say like you have to be

922
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,140
comfortable with the like I tend to do

923
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,940
this to people like you can say I want

924
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,399
to learn X and then I'm going to pick up

925
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,840
that a bit like why do you want to learn

926
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,000
X tell me like I'm gonna ask you just as

927
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,159
many questions as you're gonna ask me

928
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,799
I'm probably actually gonna ask you more

929
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,779
um so that's what I mean by come

930
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,580
prepared because it's a conversation

931
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,140
it's back and forth I'm not just going

932
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,539
to give you a path and say go because I

933
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:07,799
just I don't think that works well

934
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,179
personally

935
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:11,399
yeah awesome

936
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,100
um we talked about like unblocking path

937
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,019
to staff advocating for yourself but

938
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,779
concrete Liz there anything you have

939
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,000
seen really work for someone who's a

940
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,380
year or two out that they should focus

941
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,240
on I think there are probably some folks

942
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,159
in the room who are you know don't feel

943
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,480
like they're trying to fight for the

944
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,039
promotion but maybe they're fighting for

945
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,539
the packet

946
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,419
um and like what that might look like

947
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,120
sure I think trying to identify that

948
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,700
North Star early and say hey

949
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,380
um this is the direction I want to go in

950
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,059
this the strategy I want to develop and

951
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:45,480
build like put yourselves in the shoe of

952
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,220
your manager two years from now who's

953
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,899
saying okay I am promoting X because

954
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,240
they have done ABC and demonstrated that

955
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,559
they're at that level

956
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,700
um and you want to start writing that

957
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,080
and like if you can't write it as for

958
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,000
feedback like see what am I missing what

959
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,620
is like an example of a staff

960
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,720
appropriate project or deliverable and

961
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,159
work towards that once you have a clear

962
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,080
idea then you could go about executing

963
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,320
on it

964
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,899
I mean I've seen people hyper focus on

965
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,599
deep technical skills and completely

966
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,239
ignore what does the business need so I

967
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,820
think you know like go after those deep

968
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,679
technical skills but remember at this

969
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,359
level like if you don't have the

970
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,580
leadership skills it's going to be very

971
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,918
hard for your manager to make the case

972
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,899
yeah so the next sort of

973
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,060
highly rated question here is about the

974
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,260
fact that staff Engineers are often

975
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,699
involved in planning and Road mapping

976
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,918
and and you know maybe not Greenfield

977
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,139
work but Greenfield determination of

978
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,859
what the work should be uh what do you

979
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:45,960
do to sort of identify the next big

980
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,940
problem you or your team or your sphere

981
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,699
of influence should tackle and is this a

982
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,679
process that is you know internal only

983
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,619
is it benchmarking is it uh based on

984
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,900
some framework I think Kurt you're in a

985
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,980
bit of a different role in this like

986
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,320
deep solver mode what's your process for

987
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,080
finding big problems in research

988
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,500
so my employer is a

989
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,780
static analysis security tool our

990
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,960
customers are appsec people basically I

991
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,640
was an abstract person I built a program

992
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,099
basically from scratch for a billion

993
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:21,300
dollar company so I am deeply familiar

994
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,520
with the problems that like are sort of

995
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,440
like ideal customer profiles trying to

996
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,500
solve and so I use that as my North Star

997
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,079
for like okay because again as we've

998
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,880
mentioned several times now

999
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,820
technical skills are table Stakes what's

1000
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,980
really the differentiator for staff is

1001
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,079
being able to connect that to business

1002
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,540
outcomes because the people who are

1003
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,160
deciding whether or not you are a staff

1004
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,320
engineer are people who are deeply

1005
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,760
deeply concerned with business outcomes

1006
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,700
so you can do technical Wizardry all day

1007
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,140
long and if the business doesn't care it

1008
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,839
doesn't matter so what that's kind of

1009
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:56,460
what I use to define research is like

1010
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,079
okay what are the problems that like my

1011
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,640
peers because I still have a bunch of

1012
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,920
peers from my career that are all appsec

1013
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,660
people and so I technically like hey

1014
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,020
what do you hate right now and you know

1015
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,720
if I get four of the same response I go

1016
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,180
that's interesting let's go look at that

1017
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,060
so that's that's kind of I'm gonna stop

1018
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,619
there but that's kind of yeah that's

1019
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,240
interesting so that's alluding to the

1020
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,160
idea of like a peer Network becoming

1021
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,800
really important at this level

1022
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,420
um especially if you're in maybe a

1023
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,520
smaller company where there aren't 15

1024
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,099
staff Engineers to I lean on Clint a lot

1025
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,260
and I lean on a flint a lot too and I I

1026
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,380
don't even uh share an employer uh

1027
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,960
that's namely anything to sort of talk

1028
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,119
about how you go about identifying like

1029
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,820
work to be done Road mapping what big

1030
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,400
problems there are to tackle

1031
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,619
um I'd say basically the same thing but

1032
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:47,940
I've done it in an internal company

1033
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,320
context it's like you want to talk to

1034
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,820
the teams that you're working with and

1035
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,440
just understand what their roadmaps are

1036
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,480
what their biggest concerns are and then

1037
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,520
drive like what you want to do based on

1038
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,680
that um especially in security we're

1039
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,060
here to start the business so you want

1040
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,500
to understand what the product teams are

1041
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,119
building why they're building it what

1042
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,740
the broader context of it is and

1043
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,300
understand how to secure that and go

1044
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,380
from there

1045
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,640
um and you should be meeting these

1046
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,460
people regularly anyway even when it's

1047
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,440
not planning paint so that when planning

1048
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,880
time comes you already have a good idea

1049
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,859
of what you're gonna do

1050
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,680
I would say like well this is how I do

1051
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,960
it I look at data I look for gaps like

1052
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,480
those are my two go-to models like I

1053
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,520
look at the data I see what it's telling

1054
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,859
me and then I try to suss out is there a

1055
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,660
Gap somewhere in our business strategy

1056
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,940
that I can go after and build something

1057
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,220
to have impact it's it's that sounds

1058
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,500
really simple it's not but that that's

1059
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,140
been my go-to I recommend it

1060
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,380
awesome on a uh on a road mapping

1061
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,480
planning note we've talked about

1062
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,099
business impact being important but to

1063
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:49,740
get to staff level to succeed

1064
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,500
um how do you quantify or qualify the

1065
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,720
impact of a security project right like

1066
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,579
you're looking at the data what data are

1067
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:59,220
you looking at for research how would

1068
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,900
you ever sort of

1069
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,460
compare against things you aren't

1070
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,680
exploring right opportunity cost anyone

1071
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,660
anyone have a silver bullet for security

1072
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,200
metrics nope nope

1073
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,579
um what what do you do to paper over

1074
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:12,720
that Gap though like the security

1075
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,280
industry knows there's a gap in

1076
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,200
quantification maybe you're at Netflix

1077
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,000
where they're actually doing fair or

1078
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,980
risk quantification but most shops

1079
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,780
aren't doing that

1080
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,660
um like how do you sell security then or

1081
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,440
security impact

1082
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,980
um we try to come up with at least

1083
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,079
project appropriate level metrics I'm in

1084
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,520
the bug detection space so we look at

1085
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,800
how many you know PRS are we checking

1086
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,480
how many bugs are we actually finding

1087
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,000
how many actually do we let through

1088
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,200
um and then try to work backwards from

1089
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,160
there and we say okay you know we're

1090
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,380
going to reduce this thing by 30 this

1091
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,579
quarter

1092
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:46,260
um that's one way of approaching it and

1093
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,940
that's roughly what I try to look at

1094
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,980
there's always some Metric you can't say

1095
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,079
there's nothing

1096
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,480
really any big company wisdom for us I

1097
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,040
mean a lot of the companies are going to

1098
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,400
use okrs I am a big fan of write and

1099
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,680
objective statements I do X so that y

1100
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,320
happens right and then what are the

1101
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,720
metrics that will tell me the why right

1102
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,880
like and it could be Trend analysis it

1103
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,339
could be raw data I mean it just really

1104
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,740
depends on the problem but I always have

1105
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,540
found it much easier if I State the

1106
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,160
objective which is you know basically

1107
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,900
the goal in a lot of ways but really

1108
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,060
break it down and then just look for

1109
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,740
what metrics will help me determine

1110
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,839
whether I'm moving the needle or not

1111
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:27,420
yeah like two second question what's

1112
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,040
better a bad metric or no metric

1113
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,520
I pick no metric yeah that's the same no

1114
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,060
matter yeah

1115
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,880
I I actually think a bad metric because

1116
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,859
then you can go down the wrong path and

1117
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,260
I've seen that happen a lot so there

1118
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,700
will be no follow-up here we're gonna

1119
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,700
we're gonna take this off

1120
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,500
um awesome so we have one one question

1121
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,420
that sort of floated to the top here and

1122
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,859
just so folks know I am paying attention

1123
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:57,780
to thumbs up so if you are interested in

1124
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,119
influencing what we talk about here

1125
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,300
um go for it uh there's a question from

1126
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,880
Brandon thank you Brandon about

1127
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,960
anti-patterns in trying to reach staff

1128
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,660
positions or things you've seen sort of

1129
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,700
people either hurt their own case or

1130
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,920
hurt their own progression do you have

1131
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,040
any examples or or like what not to do

1132
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,859
people make I have a knee-jerk response

1133
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,619
brilliant jerks don't be a brilliant

1134
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,900
jerk no one wants to work with a

1135
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,599
brilliant jerk and part of staff is

1136
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,400
working with a whole bunch of other

1137
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,260
people if other people don't want to

1138
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,359
work with you you will never make it

1139
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,540
there

1140
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,020
um I would say doing a bunch of the work

1141
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,060
that you're already doing and better uh

1142
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,140
like doing that better that doesn't

1143
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,820
matter if you're doing continuing to do

1144
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,800
senior level work at senior level impact

1145
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,880
you'll do great you'll get great

1146
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,380
readings but you will not get promoted

1147
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,119
to staff because you're not changing the

1148
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,520
way you work

1149
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,680
I think I mentioned this earlier the

1150
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,940
people that I've seen really get stuck

1151
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,440
are the folks who

1152
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,300
they they just keep developing their

1153
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,740
Tech skills and again that's table

1154
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,079
Stakes as we mentioned earlier and I

1155
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,099
keep being like so you need those

1156
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,020
leadership skills like listen to the

1157
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,119
person who tells you hey you have this

1158
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,060
Gap here go chase it down

1159
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,099
um and I'd also say like

1160
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,160
to a point if you get too technically

1161
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,380
deep in one area that can be a problem

1162
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,599
because I do think especially at large

1163
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,740
companies they're looking for people

1164
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,440
with breath not necessarily depth like

1165
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,079
you you have actually you have actually

1166
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,420
decent depth but it's more about

1167
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,099
understanding the entire of the security

1168
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,859
domain not just one specific thing so

1169
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,960
like I worked in appsec I've worked in

1170
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,900
Cloud SEC I've done infrasec like I've

1171
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,599
I've tried to do many different domains

1172
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:45,720
because that's what's expected

1173
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,880
yeah and I guess I would just add one

1174
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,140
thing I've seen is that if you're

1175
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,820
reaching for staff level without your

1176
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,440
manager's buy-in like we've talked about

1177
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,640
this

1178
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,900
um you're gonna have a really hard time

1179
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,480
and so you should really think about

1180
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,560
communicating to your manager the things

1181
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,000
you're doing that you think demonstrates

1182
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,619
staff level impact and making sure

1183
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,660
they're aligned and I've seen some folks

1184
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,880
really thrash by

1185
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,440
um you know talking to their peers about

1186
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,900
how they're doing staff level work uh

1187
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,579
and realizing that that work is deeply

1188
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,079
misaligned with what the business needs

1189
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,579
or what their manager expects from them

1190
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,859
and you know unfortunately it's not just

1191
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:18,780
the work that matters it's it's talking

1192
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,400
about it getting it recognized and

1193
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,920
eventually getting promoted and sort of

1194
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,260
having that pay off for you I have one

1195
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,359
other piece of fatherly wisdom to pass

1196
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,099
on that I found very helpful please give

1197
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,140
me fatherly with the wisdom my dad was a

1198
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,599
Boeing engineer for like 35 years uh If

1199
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,160
you flew here on a triple seven he built

1200
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,540
the wings for that

1201
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,740
um

1202
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,079
he his biggest piece of advice is the

1203
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,160
unhappiest people in the least

1204
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,359
successful people he saw in the

1205
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,820
corporate world had this like did 20 or

1206
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,380
30 years of the same year every year

1207
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,440
have a different year every year

1208
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,660
and figure out what that means to you

1209
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,000
and use that as your North Star you will

1210
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,220
be successful I did that look where I am

1211
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:56,880
now

1212
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,819
awesome yeah so I think

1213
00:42:59,819 --> 00:43:00,960
um maybe time for a couple more

1214
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,660
questions one uh let's let's go through

1215
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,700
this quickly uh I will say I think it's

1216
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,859
covered in the stories everyone's shared

1217
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:09,540
in depth so if you want to know more

1218
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,000
there's a link and uh all three of these

1219
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,440
people have written like narratives of

1220
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,660
their career and how they got to staff

1221
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,700
um but like give us an example of a

1222
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,200
project or achievement that unlocked

1223
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,660
staff for you like what was what was the

1224
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,579
thing you'd point to and say really you

1225
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:25,560
know when in the packet and and got you

1226
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,578
the buy-in you needed

1227
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,180
um I'll go first uh I think for me it

1228
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,160
was really making fuzzing a reality like

1229
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,660
when I started working on this problem

1230
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,119
uh my previous employer we had nothing

1231
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,260
for it

1232
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,579
um but then over the course of a couple

1233
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:44,099
years I built a team around it and we

1234
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:45,780
started being a meaningful part of the

1235
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,060
way my company did security and I think

1236
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,440
just being able to point to that and say

1237
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,660
okay we came from nothing and now we

1238
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,640
have this thing and this exists and it

1239
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,500
was broad enough that it was affecting

1240
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,359
things org or company-wide was the main

1241
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,160
factor I would say

1242
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,099
yeah Kurt I built an abstract program

1243
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:04,740
from scratch by myself

1244
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,240
um at a company with a thousand plus

1245
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,720
employees and 500 engineers so a lot of

1246
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,460
the zero to functional I think is going

1247
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,500
to be kind of a common thread for staff

1248
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,839
like building something new that's like

1249
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,540
adopted and effective is a big staff

1250
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,359
feather if you can do it does that carry

1251
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,619
the big companies like because I think

1252
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,660
there's probably also a lot of Staff

1253
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,940
Engineers who are making things work

1254
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,859
better which at scale has huge impact

1255
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:31,619
right yeah but I do think like it's it's

1256
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:34,920
sort of that cross-organizational uh

1257
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,380
work that really stands out you know

1258
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,880
when I think about when I was trying to

1259
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,400
sell myself after leaving one large

1260
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,680
company to go to another large company I

1261
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,380
really talked about these

1262
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,119
massive programs that I ran across the

1263
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,800
entire company and I could talk

1264
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,780
specifically to the impact that we had

1265
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,599
by running those so I think

1266
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,579
I think it's the cro I do think cross

1267
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:58,260
org if you're at a really large company

1268
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,359
plays a huge role

1269
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:03,540
awesome yeah and I guess uh a last

1270
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,880
question that we saw float up here

1271
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,500
um like what do you think about roles

1272
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,000
Beyond staff is there another role

1273
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,920
that's a step function like this or like

1274
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,680
for you personally what do you see your

1275
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,260
next step where does your career go

1276
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,780
um you know as a I see are you headed

1277
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,220
into management now right every

1278
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,880
Everything ends in management or no

1279
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,200
um so I'm lucky I work at a large

1280
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,020
company there's a lot of ladder ahead of

1281
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,740
me

1282
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,540
um if I were to leave I've actually

1283
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,460
given this a lot of thought someone

1284
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,920
one of my uh mentees was like so like

1285
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,480
are you happy with where you're at and I

1286
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,339
was like wait but I'm a principal do I

1287
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:39,660
have to actually think about like that

1288
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,619
literally went through my head I was

1289
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:42,480
like do I have to think about this still

1290
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,880
and so it forced me to so I love

1291
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,020
mentoring for that reason because it

1292
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,640
forces you to to think about things

1293
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,720
right

1294
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,000
and I think for me like if I were to

1295
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,980
leave my company which I'm not saying I

1296
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,599
have any plans to I want to be very

1297
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:56,819
clear about that um please do not take

1298
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:59,700
note yeah I I would really like to be a

1299
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,680
technical advisor to a ceso at some

1300
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,599
point I think that's a really nice role

1301
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,040
for me

1302
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,599
um it's you know looking across the

1303
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,579
business strategically you're on the

1304
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:10,920
leadership team but again I don't have

1305
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,859
to do performance reviews so I love that

1306
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:16,339
sweet spot

1307
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,020
um added to that yeah I think similarly

1308
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,640
there's a lot of career growth ahead

1309
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,900
just doing

1310
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,180
um larger projects more company-wide

1311
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,339
impact and potentially getting slightly

1312
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,859
more technically deep in some of the

1313
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:30,660
technical stuff that I'm looking at

1314
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,280
um but also for me personally like the

1315
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,800
management uh like I swung the pendulum

1316
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,480
once I might go back again it really

1317
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,980
depends on what type of roles exist

1318
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,380
um where I'm at now there is one ladder

1319
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,000
Beyond where I'm at there is a principal

1320
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,220
ladder ahead of where I'm at

1321
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,040
um I'm probably shooting for something

1322
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,440
like research architect in terms of like

1323
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,400
title like that title uh it will be uh

1324
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,260
make your own title

1325
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,599
so it's I I really like this sort of

1326
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,760
like systems you know stuff like I

1327
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,859
every now and then I'll be like watching

1328
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:06,839
a trashy TV show from the early 2000s

1329
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:08,339
and like you know Hands-On keyboard

1330
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:10,020
stuff but like I really do like that

1331
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,839
sort of like

1332
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,819
understanding and like systems view of

1333
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:19,680
things and a lot of research doesn't it

1334
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,780
it's very like specialist and like I

1335
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,619
know

1336
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,780
you know this language backwards towards

1337
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,700
and upside down I know DNS really well I

1338
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,200
know cryptography really well there

1339
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,359
isn't really a like

1340
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:33,480
shape of everything kind of like where

1341
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,700
should we send research because uh if

1342
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,960
you're not familiar with sound rep we

1343
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,720
have a fairly large research team for

1344
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,760
the size of company we are so we have a

1345
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,980
lot of these really smart really

1346
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,560
talented researchers and we need to send

1347
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,140
them places and we don't have a great

1348
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,060
map for that and I don't know sorry

1349
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,500
you're saying we should focus on the

1350
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,220
business impact of our work yes

1351
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,240
tldr focus on the business and back to

1352
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,060
your work yeah and um yeah and so we're

1353
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,440
all different types of Staff engineer

1354
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,480
the last question that was asked and for

1355
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,980
folks who we didn't answer a lot of

1356
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,000
these questions are actually really

1357
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,619
important and and might be even more

1358
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,540
important to you like find any of us ask

1359
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,640
us talk to us and talk to all the other

1360
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,319
really experienced ICS you'll meet this

1361
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:14,280
weekend

1362
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,900
um last question is sort of what do you

1363
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,119
do to make your role legible or

1364
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:19,980
understandable or comprehensible like if

1365
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,200
you were to switch jobs

1366
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,119
um do you just like throw in a staff

1367
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:26,640
engineer application like do I apply for

1368
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,099
Kurt's job or is it giving toxic

1369
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:31,560
conferences like what's the one thing to

1370
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,740
do

1371
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,319
um I frame it in terms of like the

1372
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:38,880
business impact again I'm like I help

1373
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,040
make the company more secure and like I

1374
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,839
focus on these two flavors of things

1375
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:43,920
yeah

1376
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,099
yeah all plus one business impact like

1377
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:51,000
I haven't applied for a job my like last

1378
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,520
two or three because I was like they're

1379
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,140
all in network like hey like we need

1380
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,200
someone who does X and I know through

1381
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,579
the grapevine or personal experience

1382
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:01,500
that you are very good at X like I

1383
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,359
actually got punted into my current job

1384
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,420
by my mentor who was my boss at my last

1385
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,579
job he's like you are an idiot if you

1386
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:11,280
don't take this job so yeah have have

1387
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,900
friends and mentors have friends and

1388
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:15,540
mentors and that that will solve itself

1389
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,160
kind of

1390
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,380
I guess I would just say be able to sell

1391
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,020
the story right like so much of this is

1392
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,940
is selling which I really hate to admit

1393
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,260
to because I actually think I'm a

1394
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,000
terrible salesman

1395
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,800
um but I think you know know your

1396
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,480
narrative be able to speak to it and if

1397
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,700
someone pushes you back on you just

1398
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,859
just keep pushing and keep selling

1399
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:37,140
