1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,840
my name is David I'm an engineer on the

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,359
security engineering team at chime and

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,360
I've been here for almost three years

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,519
today I want to talk to you about

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,059
monocle which is an internal rails app

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,260
that we've built at chime which helps us

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,580
get everybody to do the right thing for

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,500
security specifically engineers

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,420
so we're going to look at some of the

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,180
scaling challenges we've had at chime

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,460
First for security specifically how we

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,260
approach those in terms of gamification

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,140
education and appreciation of people

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,520
doing hard work

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,239
or work that's typically not appreciated

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,399
and

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,559
some of the results we got from leaders

18
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,500
and

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,700
among engineers

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,840
and how you could get started at home or

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,719
at work I should say

22
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,940
in an easier way than what you're seeing

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,939
here like you know I spent

24
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,640
as you heard a few years here at Chimes

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,040
so this is definitely not something you

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,740
finish in a weekend

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,479
so

28
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,240
in terms of our challenges at chime we

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,640
recently tripled our engineering team

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
so that's a lot of people to learn

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,080
things

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,060
we've created a lot of new services and

33
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,939
with every new service there's different

34
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,299
Baseline security

35
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,380
configurations that you need to set up

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,659
so we've filled those

37
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,880
and we've also completed a number of

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,920
audits of PCI socks things like that and

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,520
as you can imagine those were somewhat

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,860
stressful at times raise your hand if

41
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,100
you've ever had a painful audit

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,040
okay wow that's like 95 of the audience

43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,600
so we want our teams to focus on

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,799
security

45
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,200
I think we can all agree on that

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,020
but how do the teams actually learn

47
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,119
security best practices

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,640
you can't just rely on them you know

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,500
reading things online and teaching

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,959
themselves

51
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
so also how do we get everybody to

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,360
secure their services without burning

53
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,220
ourselves out with all of the jira

54
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,099
tickets that we create

55
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:28,560
and Bernard TPMS out uh technical

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,900
program managers out with all of the

57
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,520
pinging that they have to do to get

58
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,459
people to address the tickets

59
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,200
um and then also how do we even know

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,940
whether our services are secure in the

61
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,220
first place uh you know

62
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,019
there's a lot of security tools that

63
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,060
we're all using and it's hard to figure

64
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,700
out uh you need something to fuse all

65
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,980
that information together

66
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,760
so I want to give you a little

67
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,900
illustration of what it's like without

68
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,540
monocle or a tool like it

69
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,379
um so hi this is David I'm from the

70
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,420
security team can you please resolve

71
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,760
these 23 vulnerabilities in your service

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,800
so raise your hand if you've sent a

73
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,660
message like that

74
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,760
okay nice

75
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,560
um yeah and you can imagine that this

76
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,780
kind of uh message

77
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,720
might make the engineer receiving it

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,239
feel sad

79
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,800
um some of the things going through

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,620
their head are like I didn't know I was

81
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,519
supposed to resolve these

82
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,080
vulnerabilities like why didn't somebody

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
tell me about this before I got in

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
trouble so

85
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
so to try and address that one thing we

86
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,680
do is we send a message to their team

87
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,640
Channel

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,879
and we say hey your score dipped below a

89
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,680
b because we're giving everybody grades

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,599
but or not the people but they're

91
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,420
repositories a grade between an A and an

92
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,239
f and we want everybody to be above a

93
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,280
beat if they're a production service

94
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,159
so we send them a message

95
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,900
looks like that's big enough on the

96
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,540
screen and we tell them hey do this and

97
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,159
this to improve your grade

98
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,640
they can click through and learn more

99
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,220
about it

100
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,760
when they

101
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,000
when they're on their GitHub repository

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,358
itself we are showing their grade on the

103
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,699
readme and the reason we're doing that

104
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,320
is because people spend a lot of time on

105
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,900
GitHub and looking at their own readme's

106
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,180
they'll notice oh my score is not good I

107
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,979
should make that go up

108
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,360
um and so the majority of our teams are

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
really proactive about this which we

110
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,960
love and we don't even have to ask them

111
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,139
to um follow the rules

112
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,680
so

113
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,680
here is what it looks like once you

114
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,440
click through the badge you can see a

115
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,540
number of the different rules score

116
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,340
factors that we are grading people on

117
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,620
and each one has some points associated

118
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,460
with it this is recalculated every night

119
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,840
based on API calls to different places

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,020
and you can click to expand an item and

121
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,940
learn what you specifically need to do

122
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,759
to fix that item and

123
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,100
uh some of the key items that reduce our

124
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,600
audit workload

125
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,120
are approved base images these are

126
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,139
getting rebuilt every week or so to make

127
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,060
sure that the vulnerabilities that are

128
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,720
patched are the patches are pulled in we

129
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,280
make sure that everybody has at least

130
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,560
one pull request approval you know

131
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,080
making sure you don't have like a single

132
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,479
uh actor threat type thing but also

133
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,000
making sure there's no bugs and things

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,500
we want people to resolve the

135
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,720
vulnerabilities that we find so if

136
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,280
you've got higher criticals we're

137
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,759
telling you hey please fix those

138
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,160
and we want to make sure that everybody

139
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,039
has tests and passes those tests before

140
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,560
they merge uh

141
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,840
it seems like a basic thing

142
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,759
um but you know some repos don't have

143
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,880
that

144
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,560
so we show a good amount of information

145
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,440
to leaders as well about how their how

146
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,620
our security posture is so this is a

147
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,180
screenshot of the home page of the app

148
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,520
and you can see a breakdown of how we're

149
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,639
doing in terms of who how many people

150
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,460
are above a b and this screenshot

151
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,860
roughly this is a fake one but gets

152
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,960
presented at our monthly engineering

153
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,400
review meetings

154
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,020
if you don't have one of those at your

155
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,819
company you should maybe tell people

156
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,800
have one and then you can join it and

157
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,960
present security stuff basically the

158
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,400
attendees of that are like all the

159
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,039
engineering managers and Engineering

160
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,180
leaders up to the CTO

161
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,280
so on the right

162
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,880
we've got a breakdown of which score

163
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,699
factors are passing or not and that's

164
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,740
really helpful because sometimes you've

165
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,259
got a new initiative you want to make

166
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,419
sure for example that code climate is

167
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,520
enabled for everybody or let's say that

168
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,500
we've got no security vulnerabilities

169
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,020
for GitHub security alerts

170
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,960
then you can easily

171
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,060
click on whichever bar and find all the

172
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,919
repos that are not doing that thing and

173
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,620
then just go track those people down

174
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,880
um

175
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,000
that's pretty helpful

176
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,740
so we've also built this thing called

177
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,500
risk advisor which

178
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,639
uh

179
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,500
evaluates every pull request to make

180
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,660
sure people are following our like four

181
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,479
most important rules

182
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:38,400
some of those are I already mentioned

183
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,460
but the the important one that's not

184
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,620
mentioned is dependency confusion

185
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,199
uh that's when you accidentally

186
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,120
downloaded a dependency from the

187
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,220
internet instead of your private version

188
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,020
of a gem

189
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,419
or dependency

190
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,639
so the way this looks is on your pull

191
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,660
requests you see a status

192
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,780
it's kind of small sorry but basically

193
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,520
it's showing you yes you're good to

194
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,220
merge and if you click through you can

195
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,860
see the rules that were evaluated and

196
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,419
see that your

197
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,460
ready to merge but let's say you're

198
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,400
failing some rules then this is what you

199
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,400
might see as an engineer on the page you

200
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,280
know a little red X on your pull request

201
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,740
and let's say they didn't notice that

202
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,720
and they clicked merge anyway

203
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,879
we're not blocking the pull requests

204
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,979
because we want people to

205
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,320
still be able to get their work done

206
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
um

207
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,179
so that means that they might merge

208
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,599
without passing the rule and if they do

209
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,440
the monocle will detect that

210
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,060
and automatically create a jira ticket

211
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,480
to track it so it'll also send a message

212
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,339
to their team channel so that the whole

213
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,380
team can just be aware of something that

214
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,180
happened that wasn't supposed to and

215
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,760
help resolve it

216
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,540
um

217
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,000
we found this really helpful

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,700
um you know with jira you can query all

219
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,140
of the past

220
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,620
forever's worth of Juror tickets and

221
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,339
then

222
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,320
very easily satisfy your auditing

223
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,540
requirements

224
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,300
um so we realized that even though

225
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,160
arkadi here who's giving a talk later

226
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,019
today gives a really interesting

227
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,399
onboarding session sometimes employees

228
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,260
Engineers will forget that monocle even

229
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,540
exists

230
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,279
and so we wanted to create more

231
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,560
awareness for monocle and so one of the

232
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,959
ways we did that is we came up with the

233
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,959
idea of sending scorecards and we send

234
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,800
these scorecards to slack channels and

235
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,839
it shares some basic information about

236
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,640
the repo and how they're doing

237
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,120
and we noticed that teams celebrate that

238
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,700
they have good scores and that's really

239
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,200
nice because

240
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,540
a lot of us probably have co-workers who

241
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,519
are doing important work like keeping

242
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,560
all the packages up to date but they're

243
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,019
not really appreciated because it's kind

244
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,200
of really annoying work and it's not you

245
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,700
know as cool as building a new feature

246
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,320
let's say

247
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,279
um

248
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,279
a quick note about these uh slack

249
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,320
channels that we've got we've found it

250
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
extremely helpful to create a

251
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,300
convention-based slack Channel naming

252
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,959
scheme so hashtag GH repo name

253
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,360
and uh when we

254
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,160
we have it set up so that monocle will

255
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,779
create the channels for us and add the

256
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:32,339
top contributors but that's not really

257
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,920
necessary you can just do this manually

258
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,580
um

259
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,459
and you know all of your tooling can

260
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:39,779
just send messages to those channels

261
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,240
without having to figure out the name

262
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,820
you don't need an ownership directory or

263
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,220
a spreadsheet or anything

264
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,959
so

265
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,019
uh it would be very bad if our members

266
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,019
lost trust in us and we lost the

267
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,660
financial data that they've trusted with

268
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,500
us

269
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,820
um so

270
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,760
does gamification work does it work for

271
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,399
us to give grades to all these repos and

272
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,420
I would say yes it really helps us get a

273
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,240
view of how is engineering doing how is

274
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,279
security doing and are people following

275
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,459
best practices and culture guidelines

276
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,180
um

277
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,680
so

278
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,040
we've seen that leaders can see what our

279
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,660
security posture is

280
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,940
Engineers are not overwhelmed by having

281
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,040
to check five different security tools

282
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,959
probably we don't even give them access

283
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,779
to all of those tools in the first place

284
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:34,380
um

285
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,000
and we're saving about 2 000 Engineers 2

286
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,600
000 engineering hours a year on auditing

287
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,579
um that's time that they would have been

288
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,579
spending trying to use github's

289
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,040
improving but maybe not perfect search

290
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,380
capabilities

291
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,360
um and clicking through just manually to

292
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,680
check stuff

293
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,360
so this is a graph the blue is how many

294
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,160
score factors we've been tracking and

295
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,839
that's been going up over time and the

296
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,000
green is how many repos have above a

297
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,980
beat and both of those have been going

298
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,620
up and to the right which is perfect so

299
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,380
we're safeguarding member data people

300
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,440
are improving security and leaders can

301
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,339
see the numbers going up

302
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,899
we've also found that it's much easier

303
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,260
to roll out new security initiatives so

304
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,579
every time we've got a security

305
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,019
initiative the all the structure for

306
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,120
notifying people and

307
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,519
delivering the words to people so that

308
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,440
the instructions all of that is already

309
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,240
there with monocle so we just need to

310
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,820
focus on what are the instructions and

311
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,339
then following up on the few teams that

312
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,380
don't already

313
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,920
uh follow our instructions on their own

314
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,459
um and uh just briefly on that our TP

315
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:56,519
GM's technical program managers are just

316
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,160
very happy with this as well they have a

317
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,600
lot less spreadsheets that they have to

318
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,639
track and they don't have to Ping all of

319
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,139
these engineers

320
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:05,940
and Engineering managers

321
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,139
um

322
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,120
so if you are thinking about where to

323
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,579
start for yourself think about where

324
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:13,440
where does security intersect with

325
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,019
engineering and

326
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,880
uh

327
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,200
start simple it could just be a Cron job

328
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,899
and it gets some basic information out

329
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,839
of the GitHub API and then it sends

330
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,519
slack notifications to teams and maybe

331
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,139
you have another Channel where it sends

332
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,779
reports

333
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,740
There's Something Beautiful about

334
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,220
sending slack messages which is that you

335
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,240
have a chance of

336
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,920
critical hit or whatever you want to

337
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,579
call it basically an engineer might have

338
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,800
five minutes free a junior engineer or

339
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,660
just anybody and then they see the

340
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,779
message and they fix it

341
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:56,279
and it's done you didn't have to make a

342
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,860
jira ticket and track it and all of that

343
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,540
tracking can be more expensive than

344
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,519
actually fixing the item for in some

345
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,320
cases

346
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,500
um I would also recommend checking out

347
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,779
ossf's All-Star and more generally

348
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,660
backstage as uh terms of solutions that

349
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,620
you could try setting up at your company

350
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,779
um here's a little photo of the

351
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,660
architecture so everybody is visiting

352
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,839
the rails app the rails as excuse me the

353
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,180
scores recalculate every night as they

354
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,579
talk to our different data sources like

355
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:33,180
GitHub stack rocks jira Circle CI and

356
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,860
then that gets stored into postgres

357
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,199
this is roughly how risk advisor Works

358
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,660
where subscribed to webhook events from

359
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,240
GitHub and we validate that they came

360
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,019
from GitHub and then we forward

361
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:51,120
information on to open policy agent

362
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,320
which runs these Rigo rules and tell us

363
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,360
whether or not the person is passing the

364
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,100
the rules that we've written

365
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,160
and you know based on if they pass them

366
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
or not we create a ticket notify people

367
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,920
and update the GitHub UI

368
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,320
we are authoring those rules inside of

369
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,500
the monocle repo which you know makes it

370
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,959
simple as well

371
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:16,680
um

372
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,000
talking a little bit more of the

373
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,100
philosophy of where you start

374
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,380
um it's a good idea to find Engineers

375
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,199
where they already are so ideally that

376
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,459
might be in their editor because it's

377
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,959
the cheapest place for someone to fix

378
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,459
something we haven't really gotten to

379
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:30,899
that yet

380
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,620
um next would be GitHub they're readmes

381
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,380
and pull request statuses that's what

382
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,720
Engineers are looking at all the time

383
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,000
and in slack because at least for our

384
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,160
company that's where everyone is hanging

385
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,660
out all the time they're not looking at

386
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,260
email so much or at least me

387
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,600
um and you want to give them

388
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,339
instructions that don't include security

389
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:57,420
jargon so ideally small items that they

390
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,820
can follow

391
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,380
and

392
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,720
if you can help them celebrate their

393
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,480
investment in security with their team

394
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,399
that's what the scorecard is about and

395
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,320
these messages to the team channels help

396
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,899
with that as well

397
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:14,639
so if a tree falls and no one hears it

398
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,519
did it make a sound

399
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,800
uh yes your security is definitely

400
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,459
better after these things have happened

401
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:25,860
and so showing everybody that they did

402
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,420
happen is a really nice thing

403
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,360
um so yeah uh we can move on to

404
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,820
questions in a second but if you have

405
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,620
something you want to ask us you can

406
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,600
send us an email or mention me on

407
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,959
Mastodon and probably someone's going to

408
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,639
ask this but yes we do want to open

409
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,440
source monocle but we just haven't found

410
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,720
the time yet hopefully this year we'll

411
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,220
see

412
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,800
um and chime is looking for an engineer

413
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,800
to work on data security so consider

414
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,019
reaching out this is definitely my

415
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,180
favorite favorite job ever

416
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,330
thanks

417
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,739
