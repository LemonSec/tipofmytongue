um Ben is going to talk to us today

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:15,960
about some of the blurry lines between

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,720
uh physical and digital security and all

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,820
that he learned while working at

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,699
Hollywood Video uh he's coming from iot

11

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,920
and I hope you all enjoy this extremely

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,200
serious conversation about security I'm

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,320
sure it won't be silly at all

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,020
so I have to start off by including the

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,000
slide and saying what actually is

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,579
Hollywood Video you know I uh had a

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,020
revelation as I was putting this

22
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,239
together that there may be some younger

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,680
people or people from different parts of

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,820
the country who haven't even heard of

25
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,739
this place before but we used to have

26
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,480
this thing called a video rental store

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
that you could go to and instead of

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,960
going on Netflix and just streaming

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,820
something you actually had to receive a

30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,040
tape from somebody and scan a membership

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,260
card to get a video and you keep it for

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,119
a few days and return it you didn't just

33
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,520
stream it what an amazing thing uh you

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,780
might get if you're if you're a lucky

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,640
kid like I was you might be able to get

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,360
yourself a VHS tape and an N64 game to

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,920
rent on the same day if you're really

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,460
feeling lucky

39
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,060
um other things you should know about

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,600
Hollywood Video and what it is is yes uh

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,340
I did make minimum wage there which at

42
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,140
the time was five dollars and fifteen

43
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,420
cents an hour and yes they did make me

44
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,720
wear a fake bow tie and cummerbund uh to

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,180
do this and demean myself every day but

46
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,460
I did it at that very Hollywood Video on

47
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,079
Reisterstown Road in Baltimore Maryland

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,439
so I could get that lovely 1990 Toyota

49
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,100
Camry DX my very first car so it was

50
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,280
worth it it was a lot of fun

51
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,220
um real quick who is ISE who are we so I

52
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,680
wanted to give you my perspective here

53
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,899
ISC is a security consulting company we

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,460
actually run the iot village if you want

55
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,259
to check it out after the talk we're

56
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,300
over in the Village area

57
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,459
um we do a number of white box security

58
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,879
assessments pen tests device hacks Etc I

59
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,440
help people with Scopes and things like

60
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,640
that

61
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,220
um we also offer something called start

62
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,540
um if you want to learn more about it

63
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,400
feel free to come see me after the uh

64
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,379
talk

65
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,360
there were some issues working at

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,280
Hollywood Video it wasn't exactly the

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
tightest ship to give you a sense uh the

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,319
uh a day at Hollywood Video would go

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,260
from 9 00 a.m to 1 a.m those were our

70
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,900
typical business hours and we had four

71
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,120
people working the entire day so we

72
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,459
would have people working from 9 to 5 PM

73
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,980
two people and then 5 P.M to 1 am two

74
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,319
people it was not a great situation you

75
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,000
saw how big that store was we had to

76
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,940
cover that entire place you may notice

77
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,860
all the fire this is fine that's because

78
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,800
the HVAC in the place stunk and so when

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,480
I had to wear that stupid bow tie and

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,760
cummerbund every day I had to sweat it

81
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,080
out because there was no air

82
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,019
conditioning we actually accepted checks

83
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,540
back in the day to pay for videos and we

84
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,280
had a terrible point of sale system that

85
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,319
was a real POS and I don't mean point of

86
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,300
sale

87
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,159
there's also just a stuff going on at a

88
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,140
video store I mean uh the experience at

89
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,260
the time was I would go in you would

90
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,700
have a bunch of tapes that were already

91
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,860
already returned people were coming in

92
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,900
asking for Stuff trying to check out you

93
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,519
had to put things back on the Shelf you

94
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,620
had to rewind tapes doing all this stuff

95
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,959
and keep the store clean and maintain it

96
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,760
and you had two people to do all this

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,680
stuff including a manager who may have

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,420
been in the back counting out a register

99
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,220
or something like that so it was a

100
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,140
really chaotic situation working at this

101
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,360
place for someone making minimum wage a

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,180
16 17 year old kid

103
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,580
there was one other issue that really is

104
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,019
the point of this whole discussion at

105
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,060
Hollywood Video which is that we had a

106
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,400
big problem with shrinkage now you may

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,140
know shrinkage from the Seinfeld episode

108
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,599
but shrinkage in the concept of retail

109
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,840
is loss of inventory and assets and at

110
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,700
Hollywood Video it was a sieve for this

111
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,200
kind of thing

112
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,180
um we lost all kinds of stuff all the

113
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,819
time theft was a constant problem and

114
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,799
that's kind of the premise here we're

115
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,060
going to go through some of the things

116
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,978
that happen at Hollywood Video and I

117
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,298
want to give you a sense of why it

118
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:19,918
happened and what you can take away from

119
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,720
it so when you create your own sort of

120
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,520
threat modeling or come up with your own

121
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,020
security strategy you can sort of keep

122
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,979
these lessons in mind

123
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,040
so why did all this stuff happen there

124
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,380
was tapes cash and food constantly

125
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,120
missing our inventories were never right

126
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,280
we would lose money there are things I

127
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,680
can't even talk about that we lost uh we

128
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,940
should really want to know if those

129
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,680
security controls that we had in place

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,020
were proper was it the right approach or

131
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,479
was it just we had lost because we

132
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,520
weren't doing it in the proper way I

133
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,960
think it's really also important to ask

134
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,759
what was the actual culture of security

135
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,560
like at Hollywood Video did they

136
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,540
actually care about security or is it

137
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,400
just sort of lip service was it just

138
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,780
something they said

139
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,419
uh and what do people care about so what

140
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,280
did the customers care about what do the

141
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,419
employees care about what do the

142
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,380
managers care about and what did

143
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,000
corporate care about and what's the

144
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,080
proper level of care because

145
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,820
fundamentally you know I'm saying right

146
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,380
now that we lost all this stuff there

147
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,820
was all these losses and things like

148
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,460
that but was that by Design what did

149
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,080
Hollywood Video actually care about what

150
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,759
is acceptable loss what is acceptable

151
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,320
risk we really should get into that

152
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,699
so let's walk through sort of a basic

153
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,800
threat modeling exercise obviously this

154
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,900
is not a full threat model but this is

155
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,220
how you should probably think of

156
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,380
protecting some kind of uh organization

157
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,419
so we had a number of assets at

158
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,039
Hollywood Video obviously the first

159
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,139
would be things like tapes and those are

160
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,300
the actual tape things that we would

161
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,880
have those cases uh there was also stuff

162
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,460
like food so we actually sold popcorn

163
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,940
candy sodas ice cream Etc and we had a

164
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,220
ton of it it would come in all the time

165
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,600
there's obviously cash in the register

166
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,280
you know that people were very concerned

167
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,139
about making sure that we didn't lose

168
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:00,419
money uh it wasn't exactly a high

169
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,220
Revenue place so if things were stolen

170
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,800
that would be a real problem uh I think

171
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,000
it's really important to think about the

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,800
operation of the store as an asset too

173
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,139
so if the place isn't open if things

174
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,340
aren't running if people can't rent

175
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,740
tapes if the systems don't work there is

176
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,360
no revenue and none of it even works in

177
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,660
the first place uh finally the employees

178
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,419
and the customers themselves so uh we

179
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,400
were instructed if someone was came in

180
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,600
with a gun or something and wanted to

181
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,759
Rob us just give them what they want

182
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,380
they didn't want us to get involved they

183
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,880
didn't want us to put ourselves in

184
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,860
danger for good reason you know they

185
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,060
have insurance and things that cover

186
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,220
that stuff and also the customers need

187
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,500
to be comfortable in the store right if

188
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,300
Hollywood Video was a place where people

189
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,979
didn't feel comfortable doing business

190
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,900
then we couldn't keep making Revenue

191
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,580
things wouldn't keep uh worrying about

192
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,160
so uh before I go on I mean what do you

193
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,600
guys think in the audience what do you

194
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,039
think is the most important asset

195
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,680
Hollywood Video has any volunteers

196
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,660
sure

197
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,639
maybe how much do you out of curiosity

198
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,440
how much do you think a tape cost to

199
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,039
rent in in 1999 like in other words when

200
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,199
Hollywood Video would get a tape to rent

201
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,460
how much do you think that tape cost

202
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,039
Hollywood Video

203
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,340
no actually uh if you were to buy you

204
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,660
know one of the popular titles we had

205
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,300
back then was the movie Star Wars

206
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,819
episode one and if you were buying a

207
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,979
copy of the tape to rent you had to pay

208
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,319
like 80 bucks a tape just to rent it

209
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,000
because of Licensing stuff so losing a

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,979
tape was actually a lot more than losing

211
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,539
a tape you might buy at Suncoast another

212
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,819
place that no longer exists

213
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,099
um my argument would be that the asset

214
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:33,240
that they cared about the most was

215
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,560
probably the operation of the store and

216
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,419
the employees because a lot of these

217
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,460
things are kind of replaceable if the

218
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,500
store isn't safe if its store is not a

219
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,080
good place to work at or shop at I don't

220
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,400
think any of these things matter

221
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
we had a number of threats and

222
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,340
adversaries as well so I I put a couple

223
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,259
things here so we had common thieves

224
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,500
people who would come in and they might

225
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,720
walk out with a tape or open up one of

226
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,400
those tape cases and put in their pocket

227
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,300
or steal candy or whatever or or

228
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,680
whatever

229
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,300
um but more importantly there might be

230
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,740
someone who's actually dangerous you

231
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,360
know I don't think fundamentally I was

232
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,440
we were too worried about someone

233
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,000
walking off with a tape life would move

234
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
on but if someone came in with a gun or

235
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,900
was threatening us that was something

236
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,819
that was a real concern to the operation

237
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,220
of the store but there's another aspect

238
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,960
and even though this guy looks really

239
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,759
friendly with his bow tie and cummerbund

240
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,259
and he looks like he couldn't harm a fly

241
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:27,479
he's actually kind of an Insider threat

242
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,300
because there's things like accidents uh

243
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,860
compromises on policy which I'm going to

244
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,719
talk about in a second and then just

245
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,458
straight up dishonesty where employees

246
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,979
would take stuff and I would definitely

247
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,140
never have done that that's definitely

248
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,820
not something I did at Hollywood Video

249
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,219
as a kid

250
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,380
we did have a few security tools in

251
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,180
place to help protect us and make things

252
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,459
a little bit better but you might notice

253
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:51,420
that none of these things are

254
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,180
particularly foolproof yes what you had

255
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,700
to do in 1999 was get a little

256
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,920
membership card laminated so you could

257
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,839
get permission to rent a tape and if you

258
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,040
didn't have your membership card I'm

259
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,420
sorry I couldn't rent a tape to you

260
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,160
which was the cause of many arguments

261
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,600
with customers

262
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,399
we also had things like the locks on the

263
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,560
doors the alarm system Etc but these

264
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,180
were mostly meant to protect people from

265
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,800
breaking into it and as you may have

266
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,420
seen from the picture it was a pretty

267
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,860
much a glass building if somebody wanted

268
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,940
to get in they could have probably

269
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,220
gotten in we had things like manager

270
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,260
oversight

271
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,240
um it might not surprise you that when I

272
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,680
was making minimum wage the assistant

273
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,180
manager who would be in the store wasn't

274
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,279
making a whole lot more than that so

275
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,019
expecting these managers to be high

276
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,899
level Security leaders was probably a

277
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,000
little unreasonable we had things like

278
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,800
an inventory system and a point of sale

279
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,380
system that didn't really work well that

280
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,760
unfortunately I couldn't find a picture

281
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,800
of the actual point of sale system but

282
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,920
it didn't totally uh um differ from that

283
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,660
right there as like a blue screen thing

284
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,060
that was extremely slow it barely worked

285
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,040
at all it would print even at the time

286
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,620
it was considered Antiquated we also had

287
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,360
things like the lock box that we would

288
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,620
use so when people wanted to return

289
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,019
tapes we had this big container and you

290
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,880
can see it right there where people just

291
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,399
slide things in it was locked up and uh

292
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,260
in the morning somebody had to go go in

293
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,180
and reach in and pull out all the tapes

294
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,920
that were in there and we also had those

295
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,019
little anti-theft things that are put

296
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,580
near doors that make noise all the time

297
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,320
that nobody ever does anything about

298
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
when they make noise because people just

299
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,040
walk right through them it's not exactly

300
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,860
foolproof security controls

301
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,779
so let's talk real quick about what

302
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,519
actually happened at Hollywood Video and

303
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,279
what actual stuff we lost so tapes and

304
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,080
video games we had a number of issues

305
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,240
the first thing that I saw all the time

306
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,040
was a customer would come in and say

307
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,779
yeah I returned it let me rent another

308
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,399
tape well you know according to the

309
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,019
system here you did return well no I

310
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,000
returned it and the truth is as an

311
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,380
employee who is making not that much

312
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,060
money I wasn't going to sit there and

313
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,100
argue with them about it the job if they

314
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,600
argued the manager would just let them

315
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,519
go on and you'd rent the next tape to

316
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,920
them there was other things like broken

317
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,720
inventory things that actually did break

318
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,019
you know VHS tapes were a little bad in

319
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,339
certain areas you sometimes had to

320
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:00,779
splice them and things like that I could

321
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,880
talk all about that but there was also

322
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,940
broken inventory where a customer would

323
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,160
come in and they would say hey this N64

324
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,779
game doesn't work you know Donkey Kong

325
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,940
64 isn't booting up I don't know what's

326
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,800
happening and we had these two drawers

327
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,079
that were filled with the inventory that

328
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,760
was claimed to be broken now when

329
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,560
someone comes to you and says this tape

330
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,300
doesn't work it's not like I'm going in

331
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,680
the back and testing the tape and doing

332
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,940
all all this stuff are they saying the

333
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,680
N64 game's not working I'm going to test

334
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,300
it you just put in the door and give

335
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,140
them the credit and then that's it

336
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,060
one day one of my managers said to me

337
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,560
hey Ben you know these you're a video

338
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
game guy you collect video games there's

339
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,220
all this stuff in the drawer we need

340
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,899
somebody to go test this bring it home

341
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,399
and figure out what actually works and

342
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,200
what doesn't and you know none of those

343
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
games worked it's a mirror I don't know

344
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,500
what happened to them they just none of

345
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,480
them worked they definitely didn't stay

346
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,740
in my house and I definitely don't still

347
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,620
have them uh we also had things like

348
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,180
common thefts I mean it's pretty

349
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,160
self-explanatory

350
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,839
um and other stuff like that another

351
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,579
thing that happened to me personally was

352
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,220
Cash losses uh one day I was working

353
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,320
until five and my manager at the time

354
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,779
told me hey just clock out and go home

355
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,399
I'm going to count down your register

356
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,440
and we're gonna just keep it running and

357
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,820
I see someone in the audience already

358
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,100
shaking their head the next day I came

359
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,720
in and the manager said to me hey Ben

360
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,339
I'm gonna write you up your register was

361
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:19,800
40 bucks short I didn't take the money

362
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,279
nothing happened but we didn't follow

363
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,920
policy uh someone I didn't count down my

364
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,620
drawer and so somehow the money wasn't

365
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,660
aligned up the next day I wonder who

366
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,100
took it

367
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,380
um the food was also interesting so we

368
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,720
had all this popcorn and candy and soda

369
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,579
and all this other stuff and after a few

370
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,560
hours managers would straight up tell me

371
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,540
hey Ben go grab an ice cream sandwich go

372
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,760
grab some candy or whatever they just

373
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,320
let you take things so they would give

374
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,000
us a message that it's really important

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,560
to track inventory it's really important

376
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,600
to make sure the cash is right but go

377
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
ahead and take whatever else you want

378
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,420
just take things even though we do count

379
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,920
them even though we do put them towards

380
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,779
inventory so we were just constantly

381
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,579
losing things there's also another

382
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,260
incident I can't even talk about it was

383
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,720
so significant

384
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,660
uh why did this happen why were there so

385
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,459
many losses why did this why was this

386
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,620
such a problem a lot of this was based

387
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,540
on constraints there was only so many

388
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,620
things we can do and it's really

389
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,880
important that you acknowledge when it

390
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,920
comes to security there are going to be

391
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,600
limitations in what you can reasonably

392
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,519
achieve the first thing is employee

393
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,380
safety right we weren't supposed to

394
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,000
argue with customers about what was done

395
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,800
and what wasn't if somebody came in and

396
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,420
was violent you let them do whatever

397
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,760
they want you don't get in the way you

398
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,160
just you just uh take care of them our

399
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,860
inventory controls were terrible we had

400
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,959
to do inventory once every few months

401
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,880
and the way inventory worked is they

402
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,680
would close the store entirely and they

403
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,440
expected two employees to go through the

404
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,320
entire store and scan every piece of

405
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,959
inventory in the store probably 10 000

406
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,060
tapes and games and a countless number

407
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,980
of other sort of things accessories

408
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,680
candy whatever uh that wasn't really

409
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,660
realistic and inevitably our inventories

410
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,279
were always messed up and we were always

411
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,440
losing stuff or things would come back

412
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,760
you know all of a sudden you thought

413
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,380
they were lost then you find them later

414
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,180
in some other place

415
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,019
um

416
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,760
checking tapes was just not something

417
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,320
that was going to happen and the store

418
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,060
is just huge you just can't see

419
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,500
everything that's going on in a place

420
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,480
like this if somebody's in back is

421
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,399
messing with things at the back wall I

422
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,660
would have never known about it it's

423
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,880
just gonna happen we're not supervising

424
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,779
this stuff

425
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,459
the other problem was just the bad

426
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,680
Management in place they had policies

427
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,079
but nobody followed them nobody cared it

428
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,579
wasn't enforced and we had a culture

429
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,620
that was very permissive about taking

430
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,480
things it was more about getting through

431
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,639
stuff than actually being secure

432
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,660
so what should you do with this

433
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,060
information in my opinion the thing you

434
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,440
should really do if you're trying to

435
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,540
protect your home your your personal

436
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,279
stuff your organization your business

437
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,620
whatever is to create some kind of

438
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,680
threat model Batman gets it Batman knows

439
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,120
what he needs to do to protect his

440
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,279
organization who has asked what his

441
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,839
assets are who he's trying to protect

442
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,880
what tools he has to protect the bat

443
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,040
cave and other things in place and and

444
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,899
what's out there so what you really need

445
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,760
to do is understand what your actual

446
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,160
assets are and put a value on them it's

447
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,500
not just things like cash or stuff it's

448
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,720
things like reputation available to your

449
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,300
of your service uh what people think of

450
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,860
you their comfort level working with you

451
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,480
these are all assets we need to think

452
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,579
about things outside of the realm of

453
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,800
physical traditional assets

454
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
you should also understand what your

455
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,399
adversaries are at Hollywood Video our

456
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,220
adversaries were employees common

457
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,720
thieves and robbers pretty

458
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,519
straightforward stuff

459
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,440
um but you might work in an organization

460
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,139
where your adversaries are uh foreign

461
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,000
countries and people who work for them

462
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,760
it may be uh serious cyber criminals it

463
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,440
may be people you know sophisticated

464
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,880
criminals who are really looking to do

465
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,920
harm and then finally and maybe most

466
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,720
importantly we have to understand the

467
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,000
tools are in place and then really make

468
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,260
sure that we've tested their

469
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,959
effectiveness so we know if we have

470
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,339
these tools in place are they getting

471
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:57,839
the job done are they really protecting

472
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,060
us the way they are and can we verify

473
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,620
that so that we know if something's

474
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,420
gonna happen at least we have the right

475
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,079
things in place

476
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,060

477

00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,720
um in order for someone to sign up for a

496
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,160
membership and get a card back in the

497
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,860
day did you require them to fill out a

498
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,339
paper form to put their home address

499
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,800
phone number and credit card numbers and

500
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,420
did you enter that into a computer that

501
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,759
everyone shared the password for uh sort

502
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,799
of it was kind of like that so the way a

503
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,240
membership would work if I recall

504
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,059
correctly I would need a ID like a

505
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,160
driver's license type thing I think I

506
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,020
had to photocopy it so I had to keep a

507
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,699
copy of their ID

508
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,559
they would have to give me a credit card

509
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,599
and I think it had to be like a real

510
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,579
credit card not a debit card so we

511
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,679
wouldn't accept that and we did have to

512
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,319
key it in and the idea theoretically was

513
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,660
well if we have their credit card in and

514
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,340
then they steal a tape or they don't

515
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,960
return something we can just charge the

516
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,240
card I don't remember a single time

517
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,280
where we actually did that I think it

518
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,720
was more or less that you asked for

519
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,280
these things to sort of scare the

520
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,780
customer into thinking they can't just

521
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,919
get away with

522
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,340
taking stuff forever it was a pretty in

523
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,200
uh not tight system and I certainly

524
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,660
think that the people at PCI or any

525
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,860
number of things like this sort of

526
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,240
practice would not be acceptable today

527
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,100
taking all this information

528
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,179
yeah

529
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,039
what other questions you guys can ask

530
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,360
any kinds of questions you want

531
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,059
especially if they're nostalgic ones

532
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,500
anybody any other questions yes

533
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,120
was it the same at Blockbuster or were

534
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,460
they better or worse or we were way

535
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,220
better than Blockbuster now uh it was a

536
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,500
little it was fairly similar so uh

537
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,539
Blockbuster in Hollywood I mean to be

538
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,679
honest the reason I worked at Hollywood

539
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,840
and not Blockbuster I mean I love movies

540
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,640
I love video games I still collect video

541
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,460
games and things like old retro games

542
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,120
um

543
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,039
Hollywood was walking distance from my

544
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,360
house I could literally just walk there

545
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,039
and then people could observe me walking

546
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,660
down the street in that goofy uniform

547
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,980
and stuff like that in the middle of the

548
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,260
summer but anyway they're very similar

549
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,059
stores

550
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,799
they had a specific kind of culture they

551
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,260
operated mostly the same was one better

552
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,940
than the other honestly it was six to

553
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,799
one half dozen the other we would have

554
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:44,940
things that they didn't have they would

555
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,740
have things we didn't have I was envious

556
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,419
that they got to wear Polo shirts and

557
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,760
not stupid bow ties

558
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,160
um I really hated that

559
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,140
um but they're they're equivalent

560
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,740
to me

561
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,480
anyone else anyone want to ask any other

562
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,640
questions anything

563
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,260
yes

564
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,640
let's he's got a mic

565
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,740
I know all the video stores eventually

566
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,179
went out of business

567
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:15,539
because they became obsolete but um do

568
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:18,720
you attribute that to uh Hollywood being

569
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,360
incompetent or was it just no I mean the

570
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,480
business yeah uh the business model so

571
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,640
the question was like

572
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,980
is it did Hollywood fail because of

573
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,419
these kinds of issues or is it because

574
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,980
of something else I mean the reality is

575
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,500
Netflix came along and destroyed this

576
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,960
model uh streaming uh in particular

577
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,240
ended what would make sense I mean

578
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,980
people don't want to do this stuff you

579
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,539
can still see the remnants of this with

580
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,059
things like Redbox or which I think

581
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,679
still is around where you rent the

582
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,080
things from the machine uh or even like

583
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,520
GameFly and some of these other services

584
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,280
I think still exist to do rentals but

585
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,200
the model is totally different now it's

586
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,600
hold on to it as long as you want you

587
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,220
know it has to be more consumer friendly

588
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,780
just like streaming it has to have that

589
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,700
kind of same convenience but you can

590
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,260
tell nobody really does it it's just not

591
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,820
worth it nobody wants to drive to a

592
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,740
store and pick things up it's so much

593
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,799
easier just to pull something from uh

594
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,720
Netflix or Amazon Prime video or

595
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,260
something like that

596
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,199
yes

597
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,419
if I approach you afterwards uh would

598
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,980
you be willing to talk about the

599
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,500
situation you can't talk about uh a

600
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,640
little bit I just don't want to talk

601
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,960
about publicly but we can talk about it

602
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,000
all right it's a big deal but I'll talk

603
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
about it I want to know about what

604
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,760
happened it's pretty it's pretty crazy

605
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,418
