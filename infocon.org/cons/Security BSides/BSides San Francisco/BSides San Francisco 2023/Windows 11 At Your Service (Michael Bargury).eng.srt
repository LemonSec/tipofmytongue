1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,979
thank you everyone for joining us this

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,259
glorious morning uh next up we have

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,660
Michael Burgery with Windows 11 at your

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,580
service

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,960
thank you

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,719
um so first of all I'd like to I'd like

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,099
to say thank you to everyone for

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,320
skipping early lunch I really appreciate

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,440
it and I'm going to make my best

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,420
um I'm going to try my best to make uh

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,240
to make it worthwhile for you and since

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,560
this is kind of an intimate setting

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,539
please feel free to just kind of raise

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,920
your hand if you have a question do you

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,720
want to talk don't wait until the end we

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,460
can make a conversation I think it'll be

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,380
much more interesting

18
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,719
um it is kind of briefly a few points

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,899
about me I've uh I've been focused on

20
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,660
this area of security of no code apps so

21
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,520
trying to see where they break for about

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,460
four years now I confront in the company

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,399
that's focused on this space I lead an

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,200
oscope that is dedicated to low code no

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,780
code and the risks that are that these

26
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,300
apps represent but what we're going to

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,440
do today is we're going to take in a

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,719
tackles perspective so let's just jump

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,960
into it if we don't get into uh in into

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,299
your questions during this session reach

31
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,580
out on Twitter I'm happy to to continue

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,080
conversation

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
and I promise this is the only slide

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,119
that's going to talk kind of uh uh kind

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,460
of uh no take an attacker's perspective

36
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,159
of course it's important to mention even

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,600
though this entire talk is going to

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,720
focus on on leveraging uh no code uh as

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,880
an attacker the idea here is to see how

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,580
we can use no code and secure way

41
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,380
however having said that here's what

42
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,540
we're going to do today so

43
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,079
um there's a very very big difference

44
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,720
between initial compromise of a machine

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,540
and an entire model operation so in

46
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,820
order to set a model operation you need

47
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,920
to be able to to do many many different

48
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,960
things and let me just let's just kind

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,119
of make sure we all understand what do I

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,040
mean by Marvel Ops but by the end of

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,659
this talk you'll see how you can do

52
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,939
everything that the malware needs to do

53
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,640
by using Microsoft executables services

54
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,320
and cloud services which are all baked

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,939
into windows

56
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,000
all right so uh just kind of sure we're

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,739
all on the same page on what do I mean

58
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,599
by Marvel Ops what we do what you will

59
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,340
be able to actually accomplish let's say

60
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,599
that you have an initial access to a

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,640
machine which is fine uh you might think

62
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,379
you've won but actually in the real

63
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:20,940
world there's a bunch of things that

64
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,280
would prevent you from uh kind of

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,459
getting what you want so uh you need to

66
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,200
be able to actually run malware on that

67
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,459
machine right and not just have the

68
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,319
ignition access you need to be able to

69
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,900
communicate through a firewall or any

70
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,819
sort of a network perimeter because it's

71
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,720
likely this machine uh is an internal

72
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Network you need to be able to

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,220
exfiltrate data outside you need to be

74
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,260
able to avoid defenses that might be on

75
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,300
the machine itself or on the network or

76
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,300
wherever else and of course

77
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,000
you'll you also want to uh to remain

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,459
persistent you want to to avoid defenses

79
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,019
so there are a bunch of these things

80
00:02:58,019 --> 00:02:59,879
that you need to to uh to actually

81
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,620
accomplish after you've already

82
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,200
compromised the machine and so all of

83
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,080
these things are actually kind of Grant

84
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,819
work right they're kind of kind of

85
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,500
engineering so you start off with

86
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,840
initial access and you want to get to

87
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,480
profit but in the middle of it there's a

88
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,220
bunch of things that you need to do in

89
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,440
order to really get the operation going

90
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,300
and what we're going to show is how you

91
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,220
can accomplish all of this operation all

92
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,019
of these uh kind of intermediary

93
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,260
sections here all right so the best

94
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,959
thing that we could hope for uh is to

95
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,819
have a SAS platform that would do all of

96
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,620
these things for us right because today

97
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,720
there's there's pretty much SAS for

98
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,519
everything

99
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,260
so I'm going to introduce to you today

100
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,319
something called RPA not sure if if

101
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,720
you've heard of it but RPA robotic poses

102
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,220
automation it's basically a service

103
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,099
that's uh you that's actually running on

104
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,500
user's laptops and it is in person

105
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,720
impersonating users in order to create

106
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,019
business automations so for example you

107
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,879
move your mouse you move you you click

108
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,379
things on your keyboard it would record

109
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,659
these things and then replay them and it

110
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,819
is used for example to integrate with

111
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,379
Legacy systems that don't really have an

112
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,319
API Now The crucial piece about robotic

113
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,000
process automation is it's composed of

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,180
these three separate kind of things one

115
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,579
is the election agent that runs either

116
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,459
on a user's laptop or or on some server

117
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,440
there's a controller that's able to

118
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,900
operate to reach out through the network

119
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,240
into those machine then send the payload

120
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,580
and expect it back or get back the

121
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,540
results

122
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,800
and of course there's a management

123
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,900
platform on the south side The crucial

124
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,580
piece here is that all of these are

125
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,100
trusted and when I say trusted I mean

126
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,560
that the the edls trust them the network

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,720
security trust them they'll they all

128
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,560
operate in in in in boxes that have that

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,960
have been pre-approved and so if we use

130
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,000
this specific you can see where I'm

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,560
going with this right this is an

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,100
infrastructure to run code on user's

133
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,160
laptop and then get the results back and

134
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,960
all of this is is being facilitated

135
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,120
through well this is this is actually

136
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,580
just using LPA but just in a creative

137
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,800
way and for our malicious purposes and

138
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,560
so one important thing to note is that

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,199
RPA is already pretty much everywhere in

140
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,120
the Enterprise you'll find these are

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,680
kind of the large vendors but there are

142
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,320
others and you'll find this is a pretty

143
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,979
prolific and RPA will do much more than

144
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,740
we than we initially wanted

145
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,419
um it will actually take care of a bunch

146
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,460
of engineering things for us so handling

147
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,259
errors being able to about different

148
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,840
types of os's different versions being

149
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,080
able to update the malware on on the fly

150
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,500
all of those things would be handled by

151
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,880
RPA itself

152
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,539
and so just one one uh one simple thing

153
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,120
to understand about kind of what RPA is

154
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,720
so essentially it's about replacing this

155
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,820
copy and paste that users are doing in

156
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,139
order to move data between two places

157
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:57,120
there's kind of a nice drag and door

158
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,280
Builder and it emulates users actions

159
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,139
this is cool this is crucial this is

160
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,720
running as the user in the in the

161
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,479
context of that user and there's no real

162
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,580
easy way to distinguish between a user

163
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,199
and what this thing is actually doing

164
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,560
all right and um and it's also kind of

165
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,900
in terms of use cases there are actually

166
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,120
valid use cases for this again mainly

167
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,699
integration with Legacy systems

168
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,580
okay that's enough kind of in tool now

169
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,620
we're going to see uh how we can

170
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,380
actually use LPA to accomplish what we

171
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,639
wanted

172
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,560
so here's what we're going to do today

173
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,160
we're going to start with uh uh we've

174
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,680
only we've already gone through kind of

175
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,780
very briefly uh the motivation and what

176
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,900
RPA is and we're going to go through a

177
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,940
technical Deep dive to see how RPI

178
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,860
actually works then we'll see how we can

179
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,800
abuse RPA for a remote code execution

180
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,840
about as a C2 server and then we're

181
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,460
going to just introduce a tool that will

182
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,160
allow you to do all of that yourself so

183
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,400
let's start with the Deep dive and from

184
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,440
this point in the talk I'm going to

185
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,560
focus specifically on Microsoft's RPA

186
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,900
and the reason behind it is that it's

187
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,880
already included in every Windows 11

188
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,180
machine so just take a a fresh vanilla

189
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,919
Windows 11 machine you'll find this

190
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,600
already there by the way if you've

191
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,400
uninstalled it they will install it back

192
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,840
with all of the kind of default

193
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,360
applications that you have there so this

194
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,099
is malware that's pretty that's always

195
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:25,740
already installed in Windows 11 machines

196
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,720
and that's why I'm going to focus here

197
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,300
of course this is this is not just a

198
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,919
problem about Microsoft it's larger than

199
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,960
that it's the entire industry However

200
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,060
the fact that this is already there on

201
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,680
Windows machines is crucial because

202
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,780
again Microsoft TDR for example will

203
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,419
will trust it this is bundled in

204
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,139
so let's see um let's say this in action

205
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,120
let's see how it works so from a user's

206
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,000
perspective if I go to a vanilla Windows

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,800
11 machine I'll search for Power

208
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,240
automate I encourage you to do that if

209
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,639
you have a Windows machine with you

210
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,319
you'll find this power automate

211
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,380
executable and once you uh click on it

212
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,380
you'll get into and let's see if I can

213
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,099
get this to work

214
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,800
all right so this is just going to show

215
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,960
you that uh kind of a small video of me

216
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,479
kind of opening up the LPA agent so you

217
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,819
can see I have a small kind of UI there

218
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,039
it's asking me for for an email this is

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,720
actually a user for for my office

220
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,479
account quotient I can put any of this

221
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:28,979
account here so it could be kind of a

222
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,199
malicious office account as well once I

223
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,380
do that I get a bunch of tasks that are

224
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,419
that are fetched from the cloud you will

225
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,159
see that again in a moment that I've

226
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,899
already pre-configured and this is the

227
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,940
drag and drop interface that Microsoft

228
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,860
allows you to use in order to create

229
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,580
those agents those drag and drop those

230
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,680
RPA agents and here I'm doing something

231
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,140
kind of very silly I'm just gonna open

232
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,700
up a file and then write something

233
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,920
something to that file and you can see

234
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,500
so I click play and it works and then in

235
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,640
the moment you'll see that there's a

236
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,700
file though but the The crucial thing is

237
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,279
that the agent is doing all of that and

238
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,140
there are a bunch of uh a bunch of

239
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,760
operations that are all of these things

240
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,459
are provided by this platform by the RPA

241
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,680
platform it is able to uh to operate

242
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,899
with the OS and do to do things on a

243
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,660
user's behalf now

244
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,300
one thing you might have noticed is that

245
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,720
once I connected and once I I plugged in

246
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,480
my account into this agent it synced

247
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,580
with the with the cloud and provided me

248
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,459
a bunch of these uh tasks that I've

249
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,019
already created and you can see that

250
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:36,180
these are actually payloads that I that

251
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,060
I've uh pre-created this is actually

252
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,920
going to office this is communicating

253
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,140
with office again my office it could be

254
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,380
uh it could be just kind of a malicious

255
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,779
version of office

256
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:50,339
and it's communicating with office and

257
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,959
actually fetching all of the all of

258
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,959
those payloads for us and so

259
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,180
one of the things that we should try and

260
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,620
understand is how does this

261
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,540
communication work because if you think

262
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,500
about it

263
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,200
because this is pre-packaged within

264
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,440
Windows 11 nobody is asked a network

265
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,899
admin to open a port somewhere in order

266
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:11,760
for this to actually work right this has

267
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,339
to work out of the box in every type of

268
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,720
environment with every type of network

269
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,580
configuration and so we need to

270
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,700
understand what is going on here so um

271
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,980
here's kind of a high level view of it

272
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,380
on one side there's power Tomatoes

273
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,540
somebody's laptop and on the other side

274
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,820
of the cloud let's start with the laptop

275
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,040
itself so power automate is actually

276
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,339
using two separate executables here that

277
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,040
are running under two two different

278
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,459
services on the machine you can see that

279
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:43,200
one of the so does the power automate

280
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,540
executable that runs on the users on

281
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,120
context and there's also another service

282
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,519
account that is created locally which

283
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,380
runs this machine runtime the machine

284
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,600
runtime is going to be the thing that is

285
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,399
going to communicate with office and

286
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,800
these two these two can communicate the

287
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,899
machine runtime can also spin up power

288
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,860
automate agent on a new user sessions so

289
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,360
you can provide it with the username and

290
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,339
password the local one and this it will

291
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,980
create it will start a session for that

292
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,260
user and then use a power automate to

293
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,019
run to run things down

294
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,459
all right

295
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:18,180
um

296
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,940
power automate is also able to work with

297
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,220
the browser to automate the browser and

298
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,019
this is done through extensions again

299
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,839
Edge would come once you use power

300
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,220
automate Edge would have this

301
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,980
pre-installed and then it allows the

302
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,019
agent to control whatever you have on

303
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,640
the browser of course again because this

304
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,380
is running on a user context you can

305
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,300
steal whatever the user has in their

306
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,640
browser context which of course opens up

307
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,620
a whole wide of a range of opportunities

308
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,560
and so there are executables that there

309
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,300
that are related to communicate to

310
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,339
communicating with the browsers and

311
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,680
actually I've only shown I've only

312
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,720
talked about three different executables

313
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,399
that are pre-packaged but you can see in

314
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,839
this picture there are a whole bunch

315
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,839
more of them and if you're looking for

316
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,260
an area that you that could be fun kind

317
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,519
of to play around with I strongly

318
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,620
encourage you to look into it just like

319
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,540
a few months ago somebody found the NRC

320
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,620
Hills and in one of those so go ahead

321
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,220
um

322
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,579
so that's kind of one side and and the

323
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:18,779
thing to note is that all of these

324
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,760
executables they won't be stopped by the

325
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,560
ADR because the ADR has to trust them

326
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,480
they are part of office they are part of

327
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,540
windows all right the next thing is how

328
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,860
does this thing communicate with the

329
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,920
cloud how does it work in a way that can

330
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,500
go through network network the network

331
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,120
boundary the corporate Network boundary

332
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,680
without asking for permissions

333
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,620
any ideas

334
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,360
okay so this is kind of uh they're

335
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,079
actually using a nice a a nice feature

336
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:50,519
or a nice service by Azure called

337
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,980
service bus or Azure relay essentially

338
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,660
they opening up an outbound

339
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,459
Communication channel and then they are

340
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,700
querying a queue uh uh on a schedule

341
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,620
which means that they are able to go

342
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,360
through anything because usually you

343
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,160
don't people don't block outbound

344
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,560
communication and so this is the way in

345
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,420
which office in this machine can work

346
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,339
again this is this is going to be to be

347
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:14,160
the way for us to push uh to push

348
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,480
payloads in and to exfiltrate data out

349
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,600
okay once you connect your power

350
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,579
automate agent once you go through what

351
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,620
I've what I've so what I've I showed you

352
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,899
a few minutes ago with the video you get

353
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,000
a nice little UI that shows you all of

354
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,040
the machines that you have connected to

355
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,899
your account uh you can see the status

356
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,820
of the of those machines which ones are

357
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,740
connected or not how many jobs are

358
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,380
executed in each one of those uh of

359
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,480
those machines of course you can run

360
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,660
tasks from the cloud so this is me going

361
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,600
to the uh to the Microsoft UI for my

362
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,360
with my malicious Microsoft tenant and

363
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,279
then I'm just going to I can just click

364
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,500
on run some automation on somebody's

365
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,760
machine a machine that I've

366
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,980
pre-registered and I can run that on the

367
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,260
machine and once I do that I get uh

368
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,959
status for the tasks I can debug arrows

369
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,700
I mean there's a whole bunch of there

370
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,779
are a whole bunch of engineering

371
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,639
features here that can help me make sure

372
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,060
that my model is operating successfully

373
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,200
okay

374
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,740
so we are we now that we understand how

375
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,839
power automate works and how is it how

376
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,139
it's able to actually uh do do what it's

377
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,480
supposed to do let me show you how you

378
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,000
can use it as a hacker so what we're

379
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,220
going to do is show you all of the all

380
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,380
of the things on on our wish list on our

381
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,420
malware operation wishlist and how they

382
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,459
can be accomplished with this Microsoft

383
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,420
agent

384
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,860
all right

385
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,920
I'm going to start very simply I'm just

386
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,500
going to start by creating a Microsoft

387
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,139
malicious tenant this is pretty easy you

388
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:47,579
can just create your own tenant with a

389
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:49,740
few clicks you don't need to import to

390
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,959
you don't need to pay anything you don't

391
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,180
need to put in a credit card it's uh

392
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,880
it's very easy once you do that you have

393
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,339
your own version of office so your own

394
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:01,680
tenant inside of office here I called it

395
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,800
pantos as a joke for Microsoft and then

396
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,160
you can start to register machines into

397
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,560
this tenant which actually means to do

398
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,440
the infection so how do we infect a new

399
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,019
machine with this type of manual

400
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,000
well you we've actually seen this why

401
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,519
does this little UI thing when I go to a

402
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,160
new machine I can open up the UI and

403
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,139
then I need to register and when I when

404
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,639
I enter a user here I'm just going to

405
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,380
enter the user for my malicious tenant

406
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,160
now of course using a UI to do that uh

407
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
is not would wouldn't be really like

408
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,380
very good malware right so in in order

409
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,160
to do this uh silently we'll want to to

410
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,260
be able to avoid the UI and the question

411
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,300
is can we do that can we bypass this UI

412
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,279
and maybe operate directly with the

413
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,899
internal apis

414
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,600
well we don't really need to because

415
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,940
this is provided by Microsoft so there's

416
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,100
a script that's bundled into Windows as

417
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,320
well let's uh you can see the title here

418
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,420
silently register on your machine

419
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,399
and when you do that this this is

420
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,600
available through command line or

421
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,459
Powershell where you do it when you do

422
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,380
that you provide your own malicious

423
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,540
tenant you can provide you you provide a

424
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,760
malicious user within that tenant and

425
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,680
from that moment on the agent is

426
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,779
connected to your own malicious tenant

427
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,420
now one question uh somebody asked me

428
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,639
once is what happens if the agent is

429
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,199
already registered if people are already

430
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,720
using this so fortunately you can

431
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,820
register a few different tenants with

432
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,639
the same machine okay so there won't be

433
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,860
any conflicts and if the user opens up

434
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,420
this power automate agent on their

435
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,360
machine it will still allow them to to

436
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,120
to to log in

437
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,019
they will not see the fact that it's

438
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,639
already register because I've used this

439
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,279
silent registration script all right so

440
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,259
this is this is infection I this is just

441
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,300
once I have initial access the only

442
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,560
thing I need to do is run this script

443
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,899
and that's it once I have that the

444
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,480
machine is registered to my uh to the

445
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,519
list of machines in that I have in on my

446
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,880
SAS on my Microsoft tenant and now one

447
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,860
thing that's in important about this

448
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,559
silent registration script is the fact

449
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,540
that I'm not sure if you've noticed but

450
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,240
I was running on an admin for this

451
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,400
Powershell which actually makes this

452
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,939
kind of a weaker right

453
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,140
so one of the things we wanted to do is

454
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,359
make sure that is see if we are able to

455
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,540
bypass this to run this as a user and so

456
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,000
we did something very sophisticated we

457
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,720
tried and and it just worked so this

458
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,460
script even though it's advertised to

459
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,620
only work for admins it works for

460
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,299
everybody Microsoft is aware of this

461
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,160
process and of this thing you know

462
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,740
working on solving it but for now it

463
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,360
hasn't been solved yet

464
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,419
all right once I have this agent this

465
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,220
machine registered to my malicious

466
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,559
tenant the next thing I need to do is

467
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,200
just trigger the workload from the cloud

468
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
I set up a connection to the specific

469
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,039
machine and then I can distribute the

470
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,260
payload from the machine to the specific

471
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,419
to the from the cloud to the specific

472
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:59,940
machine so this is exec this is a C2

473
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,880
server right they are they are the agent

474
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,580
is going to Azure relay it's looking for

475
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,440
payloads and then every time it files

476
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
payloaded I can put there through this

477
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
UI it will execute them on the machine

478
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,460
and let me I'm going to skip a couple of

479
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,620
slides here because I I know we're kind

480
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,220
of out of time uh or reaching reaching

481
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,799
that that point but let's see what what

482
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,900
we have done so far and we haven't done

483
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,480
much is one we're able to deploy this

484
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,039
malware so we're able to infect a

485
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,100
machine we're able to avoid defenses by

486
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,520
definition because again I've only used

487
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,679
uh bundled in executables and services

488
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,600
that are operating with Microsoft Cloud

489
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,360
and of course persistency is is easy as

490
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,400
well because again this is all things

491
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,500
that are used by Microsoft so they are

492
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,360
in charge of making sure that if the

493
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,460
laptop is rebooted or something then

494
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,039
that then we are still uh then this

495
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,360
agent is still working of course if

496
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,960
somebody resets the machine that uh at

497
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,480
um kind of permanently then then we

498
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,580
would be out what I'm going to show you

499
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,740
now is what kind of actual payloads we

500
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,020
can do with this so we're already in a

501
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,380
machine we can uh we can we can start to

502
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,480
to see what this agent can actually

503
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,520
accomplish for us

504
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,740
okay let's start with something very

505
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,480
simple let's say I want to do data

506
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,640
exfiltration so I want to steal a

507
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,000
specific file from this machine this is

508
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,740
a very simple automation that I've just

509
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,380
built here I'm just opening up a file uh

510
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,020
storing its content in the output in the

511
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,380
output of this job and once I run this

512
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,559
from the cloud side I give it an input

513
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,020
of the specific file that I want and the

514
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,520
output would just be the bytes of that

515
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,600
file

516
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,660
um now one thing that we need to make

517
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,660
sure we understand is how this data

518
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,940
actually goes out and so just as a

519
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,760
reminder this is operating through the

520
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,620
trusted Communication channel that with

521
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,120
that Microsoft has established for us

522
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,100
payload is going through the trusted

523
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,260
Communication channel channel and data

524
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,780
exfiltration goes down the same route

525
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,480
so you want it would be very difficult

526
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,580
for you to actually catch this cache the

527
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,860
data exploration ongoing

528
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,400
the next thing I want you to see is uh

529
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,500
code execution so what if we want to run

530
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,900
just kind of whatever we want

531
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,960
um so one thing we could try is to use

532
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,299
the functions in that are provided by

533
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,840
this agent to actually run a scripts so

534
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,059
you can run python you can run command

535
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,740
line or any other thing but that would

536
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,380
of course trigger if we in this instance

537
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,840
here I'm running mimikats that would of

538
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,940
course trigger the the defender right

539
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,340
because the idea because that part is

540
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,320
not trusted you're just running a script

541
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,260
so instead of running the script

542
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,260
what what if we stay in The Trusted Zone

543
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,360
What If instead of running a script and

544
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,640
executable a payload something we build

545
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,280
our entire payload with no code with

546
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,020
this drag and drop interface

547
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,360
so the question becomes what can you do

548
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,200
with it

549
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,960
how advanced is this language or what

550
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,760
are The Primitives that we have in order

551
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,640
to actually build things on our own so

552
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,799
and and the answer to that is that these

553
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,980
agents are very very very powerful these

554
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,320
are just a few examples but uh you can

555
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,660
trigger HTTP endpoint you can three HTTP

556
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,880
calls you can encrypt files you can

557
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,799
communicate with active directory

558
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,400
Windows Services uh processes you can

559
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,200
look in into files and folders you can

560
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,760
automate the browser you can take

561
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,620
screenshots you can go to the you can

562
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,419
control The Mouse and the keyboard you

563
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,340
can control the clipboard this is

564
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,740
basically everything you want right and

565
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,020
as long as you build your payload with

566
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,000
this drag and drop interface Microsoft

567
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,760
will execute it for you and you want and

568
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,620
you won't go out of the trust of The

569
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,659
Trusted zone I'm going to show you just

570
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,400
one example and then I'm going to skip

571
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,500
forward because unfortunately we're

572
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,000
running out of time

573
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,620
um but here's a kind of a very quick

574
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,200
example of no code ransomware this is

575
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
iterating through a directory and going

576
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,780
school subdirectories and then using the

577
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,000
encryption encryption function which is

578
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,580
provided by this agent in order to

579
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,760
actually kind of override the file and

580
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,340
again this is being done this is this

581
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,960
entire thing is running in a Microsoft

582
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,760
executable so it would be very difficult

583
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,120
to to try to to to remove this without

584
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,120
removing power automate as a whole

585
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,559
I'm going to jump a few steps forward to

586
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,700
show you

587
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,419
um so again there are many things once I

588
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,120
have kind of a arbitrary execution I can

589
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,580
do pretty much whatever I want uh and

590
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,679
and there are and everything that we

591
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,780
wanted to do uh would be available

592
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,059
through this agent and so one thing that

593
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,760
I want to leave you off with is a way

594
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,440
for you to actually use this when you

595
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,280
when you go but back home and so

596
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,419
um

597
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,240
I'm going to so there's a tool that that

598
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,940
I've released a few about about six

599
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,400
months ago called PowerPoint and this is

600
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,320
this tool basically does everything that

601
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,600
they show you here in this talk so once

602
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,360
you take this tool let me

603
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,000
switch here once you um once you use

604
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,559
this tool it's available here on in this

605
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,900
on this link it will accomplish all of

606
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,640
these different things for you so we'll

607
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,280
be able to infect a specific machine you

608
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,320
will be able to exfiltrate data all of

609
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,840
the payloads would be are repackaged and

610
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,400
in order to use it all you need to do is

611
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,700
actually just set up a Microsoft tenant

612
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,620
for yourself so if you're interested

613
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,020
we're just going to we'll just uh

614
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,760
approaching the release of the of

615
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,260
another version of this tool which is

616
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,700
going to be much more convenient and

617
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,980
robust uh if you're interested check it

618
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,659
out and start the report you'll get the

619
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,220
notification

620
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,740
so the one thing I have to do before I

621
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,240
finish off

622
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,220
is help you defend yourself from from

623
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,740
this thing because otherwise uh I've

624
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,440
just created harm and so uh here's what

625
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,360
you need to do the first thing and the

626
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,100
most important thing that could stop

627
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,960
this entire attack is to monitor the

628
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,059
usage of this pre-packaged silent

629
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:05,400
registration executable you can see the

630
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,440
name here the number one thing you

631
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,760
should be looking for is any

632
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,380
registration to a tenant that isn't

633
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,039
yours that should be a giant red flag

634
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,200
there is also a way if you're using uh

635
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,179
if you have a way to to change goal

636
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,179
policies and pre-install them on every

637
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:23,280
machine you can actually limit which

638
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,179
tenants can can be registered to uh to

639
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,220
use this power automate agent and other

640
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,840
than that there's a bunch more

641
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,880
information about this specific attack

642
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,460
and other attacks related to uh to the

643
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,840
no code infrastructure that Microsoft

644
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,700
has and others as well there are a

645
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,640
couple links here and all of these kind

646
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,559
of the slides the links everything will

647
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:46,799
be available on this link up there

648
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,100
um so there's a much more information

649
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,360
thank you very much for being with me

650
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,220
over lunch

651
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,039
um it's been great fun

652
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,960
thank you plus okay Michael

653
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,059
[Applause]
