1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,159
all right morning everyone

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,899
thank you for bearing with us

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:05,460
um did you know technology is difficult

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,140
I don't know if you've bumped into this

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,940
in your career before

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,580
but hi we're here to talk to you about

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,920
uh creating change through policy

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,719
process and other security shifts

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,220
without making everyone you deal with

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,460
hate your stinking guts

11
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,720
and to do a little bit of vocabulary

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,340
setting for this so we're talking about

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,320
getting users on your side A lot of

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,300
times that means end users here we're

15
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,519
talking more about people that are

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,859
Partners within our organization folks

17
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,480
who depend on our work to get their work

18
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,399
done and the people that we need to buy

19
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,079
into what we're doing in order to make a

20
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,460
better more secure experience for them

21
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,920
and everyone else because without them

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,700
absolutely none of this will go

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,579
hello I'm Amy Martin I'm a project

24
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,200
manager with San Francisco Digital

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,940
Services we're part of the City and

26
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,280
County of San Francisco before that I

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,680
was a public librarian for 17 years most

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,020
of that in Oakland I ship public

29
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,420
libraries and Civic techs so hard I have

30
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,719
an mlas and everything and I right now

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,820
work mostly on website migrations for

32
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,040
government agencies that's where I

33
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,840
really love to work

34
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,860
my name is Brianne Boland I work in

35
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,920
product security at Gusto

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,000
i words and communication are really

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,439
important to me to the point that I also

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,900
write a lot of fiction uh I find that

39
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,340
creating an experience around security

40
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,140
is not exactly super different from

41
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,960
creating worlds

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,780
and I'm a big believer in using gentle

43
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,880
persistent Relentless persuasion to get

44
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,140
what you need for security things

45
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,259
so we want to start you with a couple of

46
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:38,280
stories

47
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,040
um both of them spoiler are failures but

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,479
I promise everyone learns a lesson in

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,720
the end

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,380
okay I'm going to take you back to

51
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,659
January 2022 when I left my public

52
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,939
library job and joined the delivery team

53
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,280
at San Francisco Digital Services we

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,439
needed to move about 80 websites off our

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,380
Drupal 7 platform and onto sf.gov which

56
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,000
is the city's unified and accessible

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,520
website in advance of the planned end of

58
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,860
life of Drupal 7. that was meant to be

59
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,020
in November 2022. it didn't happen

60
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,119
that's a whole other story when I

61
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,919
started a digital services in January

62
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,780
about a third of the Departments we were

63
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,520
working with didn't know yet that they

64
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,300
were going to have to move their

65
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,860
websites by November

66
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,220
many of those liked their current

67
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,060
government-oriented government speak

68
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,420
oriented websites just fine

69
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,800
sf.gov is built for usability and

70
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,379
accessibility plain language is key not

71
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,780
government speak every site we moved

72
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,700
required content redesign and Department

73
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,520
staff had to be trained to do the work

74
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,739
so how can government digital service

75
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,840
staff convince civil servants and other

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,640
agencies to embrace digital

77
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,160
transformation in the face of big

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,040
unwanted change project

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,800
the short answer is we only did part of

80
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,019
that we did move the websites before our

81
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,000
deadline and we got people started on

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,920
building user-centered websites and

83
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,620
writing in plain language however most

84
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,260
of them did not continue that work some

85
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,000
of them even got rid of the content that

86
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,739
we made for them and pasted their old

87
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,500
content back in so although we met our

88
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,180
goal of moving the websites by the

89
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,920
deadline we found that we had fallen

90
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,959
short of setting government agencies up

91
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,000
for future success with user-centered

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,540
websites

93
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,459
my story takes place in a little bit of

94
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,680
a smaller scale this was a few jobs ago

95
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,420
I was a site reliability engineer but

96
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,640
already pointing towards security and I

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,900
was tasked with a colleague to write

98
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,700
anti-fishing documentation in a

99
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,959
presentation for the whole company after

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,300
we'd gotten hit by text a few times

101
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,400
the audience included Engineers but it

102
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,599
also had a lot of sales and marketing

103
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,800
people which I don't mention because

104
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,300
like oh I had to talk to non-technical

105
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,019
people

106
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,220
um I don't actually find that extremely

107
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,180
important

108
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,159
what was very different was that you

109
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,739
know as an engineer I've gotten I think

110
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,239
one random phone call in the last

111
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,280
several years and it was pagerduty I

112
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,540
just hadn't added them to my contacts

113
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,239
yet so a known Menace you know

114
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,739
in our case you know the sales and

115
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,180
marketing people their jobs depend on

116
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,220
things like picking up phone calls they

117
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,540
don't know responding to texts and

118
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,819
emails from strangers it's necessary so

119
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:03,959
we had to give more nuanced guidance

120
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,459
than just like well just you know don't

121
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,340
answer the scammer try that out

122
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,780
in our case

123
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,900
what went wrong was that writing complex

124
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,420
documentation about a really big subject

125
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,880
for a really wide audience is really

126
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,380
difficult and there's some Nuance you

127
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,839
have to apply that uh we all had to

128
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,619
learn on our feet

129
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,460
so how can a project start doomit

130
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,960
there are a few potential sources of

131
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,000
Doom one is that your planning doesn't

132
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,400
account for reality another is that your

133
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,840
engagement doesn't account for the real

134
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,240
needs limitations and motivations of

135
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,380
your users

136
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,500
another is meteor from space or other

137
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,360
things outside of our control that might

138
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,160
have felt way less possible before and

139
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,400
March 2020. now I write large-scale

140
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,680
crisis into every risk plan I make on

141
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,600
projects

142
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,699
so we can't control everything what can

143
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,199
we do

144
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,300
again remember that your partners are a

145
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,580
user group like with end users it is

146
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,199
worth your while to get to know these

147
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,800
users motivations limitations wants and

148
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,720
hard knows things they absolutely will

149
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,500
not tolerate

150
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,600
for that I find it useful to find the

151
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,940
similarities between groups because they

152
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,220
will tend to have background and

153
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,340
tendencies to pool together for this I

154
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,960
like using a really lightweight version

155
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,780
of personas which unlike the kind in ux

156
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,940
or marketing it's not extremely research

157
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,080
heavy it's just based on your own

158
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,000
collected observations across time

159
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,800
so instead of kind of intrusive stuff

160
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,120
like you know what's your income what's

161
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,699
your educational level it's more like oh

162
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,259
this group is familiar with these tools

163
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,419
but not so familiar with these ones or

164
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,400
oh yeah these people deal with security

165
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,500
all the time but this other group if

166
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,820
security shows up in their inbox their

167
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,900
first thought might be that they're in

168
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,979
trouble

169
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,960
are they open to change or are they kind

170
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,460
of resistant and then if they are

171
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,720
resistant it's really important to find

172
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,740
out why

173
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,300
and what motivates them like what does

174
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,500
professional success look like for them

175
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,699
I would actually specifically advise you

176
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,800
to avoid unhelpful demographic

177
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,660
information you want to focus on the

178
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,280
differences that are meaningful to you

179
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,320
but avoid stereotypes and most

180
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,880
especially avoid guessing because if

181
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,960
you're at the point of needing to make

182
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,419
these personas we know that your guesses

183
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:16,919
are not going to be the thing that gets

184
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,620
you through this situation with uh the

185
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,160
action you need

186
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,419
and if you encounter resistance it's a

187
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,340
great time to slow down and regroup

188
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,440
if you feel resistance forming

189
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,060
especially if you start feeling like

190
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,919
consistent resistance across different

191
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,380
people then it's time to go back rethink

192
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,720
take what you've learned and then find a

193
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,580
new strategy or a hypothesis

194
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,860
but before you roll it out there it's a

195
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,360
good idea to go back to someone in the

196
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,680
group that wasn't feeling served at

197
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,900
first and ask them for their take on it

198
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,120
this has a couple different applications

199
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,400
one is of course like tell me if this is

200
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,740
also wrong but also when we deputize

201
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,120
people a lot of times they want to step

202
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,979
up and they get invested

203
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,780
I like telling them that they hold the

204
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,699
one key to success to doing this that I

205
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,199
cannot under any circumstances make

206
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,780
myself and usually people feel pretty

207
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,699
special when you say that which is good

208
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,240
because they are

209
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,220
it's also a really good idea to make the

210
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,560
behavior you want into the easy path and

211
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,699
this is something I talked about in a

212
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:15,720
b-sides talk last year about

213
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,000
documentation

214
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,699
then as now I'm a big fan of bribes give

215
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,080
people snacks and stickers they respond

216
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,180
really well to it but we can go further

217
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,319
than that

218
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,759
one thing is that whatever you're

219
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,259
putting in front of them something to

220
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,060
read something to watch put the

221
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,160
important stuff first don't bury it

222
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,539
don't think like oh but they need to get

223
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,639
through this context usually they don't

224
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,979
a lot of times they don't just the thing

225
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,479
that you want them to do like have that

226
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,280
front and center with bullets in a

227
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,139
colored call out box make it unavoidable

228
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,580
and undeniable

229
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,020
so for that reason I like executive

230
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,520
summaries too just a page or two at the

231
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
front of a longer report or if people do

232
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,759
really have to Wade through all the

233
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,039
content having like tldr boxes

234
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,380
occasionally is both merciful and really

235
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,759
functional

236
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,259
it's also a great time to revisit

237
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,000
accessibility which is the right thing

238
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,639
to do and usually legally mandated but

239
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,620
it also goes beyond just ability stuff

240
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,360
to reaching people who absorb

241
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,819
information in different ways

242
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,680
um I can watch a video I can hear a

243
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,360
video I really prefer reading so

244
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,440
whenever I see a video with the

245
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
transcription immediately below I feel

246
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,099
seen in like a golden light is coming

247
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,479
down upon me thank God I don't have to

248
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,340
watch the 17 minute thing

249
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,720
and I know I'm not the only one like

250
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,900
that

251
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,979
and when you're thinking about how to

252
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,020
make things easy look to the Past like

253
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,840
what is normal in your organization

254
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,039
um you know no one loves getting

255
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,380
training dictates via email but if

256
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,880
people are used to it

257
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,320
it lets them know immediately what's

258
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,179
expected of them so you don't have to

259
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,500
bring everything from the past forward

260
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,940
but there might be something useful in

261
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,200
there that's worth keeping just because

262
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,620
people don't have to do as much adapting

263
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,060
but wait you might be saying like tech

264
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,560
people are used to horrible content we

265
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,480
issue mandates it's what we do

266
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,860
why do we need to think about this at

267
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,779
all

268
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,160
and that's because people are part of

269
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,200
the system too and both people and

270
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,580
systems work better if you give them

271
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,080
what they need

272
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,760
the other thing is people will not adapt

273
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,080
the change the changes you recommend if

274
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,880
you don't make it easy explain it well

275
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,380
and make the behavior that you want into

276
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,640
the easy path

277
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,160
technical motivations alas always have

278
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,880
human implications

279
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,680
and unfortunately I must tell you

280
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,320
something sad it doesn't matter how

281
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,180
incredibly fabulous your new training

282
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,160
paradigms are or the wonderful tool that

283
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,779
you've purchased and what the person in

284
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,399
sales told you that this will solve all

285
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,779
of your problems

286
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,399
people aren't going to go for it if you

287
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,380
don't get them into it they might agree

288
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,120
begrudgingly at first and then we're

289
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,260
still the first day that they're

290
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,940
stressed they might revert to old habits

291
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,700
and abandon what you're doing and make

292
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,600
you start all over again

293
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,320
okay so we talked about some strategies

294
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,600
let's revisit how do projects fail

295
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,940
missing buy-in it doesn't have to be an

296
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,860
exhaustive propaganda campaign but it's

297
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,940
just good to get people on your side

298
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,620
that can mean just saying you know hey

299
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,420
in two weeks this is coming in one week

300
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,980
this is coming check your email tomorrow

301
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,500
just to let them not be taken by

302
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,200
surprise people do not like surprises

303
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,720
a large disruptive projects for the

304
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,760
benefit of benefit of security it's kind

305
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,080
of a normal thing they get pushed into

306
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,880
being just because we have to you know

307
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,920
comply with the law or something but if

308
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,420
we do it without considering how it

309
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,920
affects the people who are going to be

310
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,080
subject to it

311
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,580
is going to be a much harder cell than

312
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,899
it has to be

313
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,600
and then this is a big one contempt for

314
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,940
users and other affected Parties by

315
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,140
those in power

316
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,940
all of your future efforts will be

317
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,680
diminished will have sand thrown in the

318
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,620
gears if people can tell that you think

319
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,540
that you are better or smarter than the

320
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,860
people you're serving or that you know

321
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,200
their lives in reality better people

322
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,140
hate this and they will remember it and

323
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,579
they will make everything you do in the

324
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:45,959
future harder if they think that you're

325
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,279
acting like that in bad faith

326
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,300
so how can we fix this because I'm like

327
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,160
a meteor a lot of this is stuff that we

328
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,459
can control

329
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
so going back to the anti-fishing

330
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,140
presentation

331
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,360
our goal wasn't to say like here's an

332
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,339
exhaustive history of fishing here is

333
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,660
what all the texts look like did you

334
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,680
hear about this thing that happened to

335
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,620
Netflix in 2017 it does not matter

336
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,480
instead it was important that it

337
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,459
couldn't go too long we wanted a short

338
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,680
memorable set of guidelines

339
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,760
um that people people could remember

340
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,380
really easily who wanted to relate cause

341
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,760
to effect so people could tie it

342
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,899
immediately to the work that they were

343
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:19,860
doing

344
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,420
we also wanted to be informed by

345
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,060
technical needs but not so much that it

346
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,380
buried it because a lot of our audience

347
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,959
frankly didn't care and didn't need to

348
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,700
and indulging that technical curiosity

349
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,140
separately in a leave behind that was

350
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,420
available but was not mandatory and was

351
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,219
made clear that it was strictly optional

352
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,720
in the case of the sf.gov website

353
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,940
migrations fixing it is still very much

354
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,160
a work in progress a lot of our work in

355
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,260
2023 has been around evolving our

356
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,060
practices and platforms to help our

357
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,700
users experience digital transformation

358
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,440
here are some things I'm trying

359
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,120
consider accessibility and cultural

360
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,800
differences I'm working on the

361
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,600
accessibility of the artifacts I create

362
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,279
and becoming more flexible with the

363
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,019
formats and platforms I put them into

364
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,300
city government is very typically a

365
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,100
Microsoft house it's not my team's

366
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,019
preferred set of tools but many of our

367
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,940
users are wary of using anything else

368
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,399
and some of them aren't allowed to

369
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,399
emphasize Common Ground my background is

370
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,040
outside of tech when I talk with users I

371
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
lead with my government background that

372
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,180
allows me to show users our similarities

373
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,700
I make it a point when it's relevant to

374
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,800
visibly not understand things and ask

375
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,079
questions to normalize those behaviors

376
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,940
to teach people it's normal to not

377
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,560
understand things it's normal to ask

378
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,839
questions about how something works

379
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,600
say things the easy way on sf.gov we

380
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,579
write in plain language but it can be

381
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,019
hard to remember to do that when we're

382
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,779
speaking with our users too a tip can be

383
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,579
if you if what you need to say to

384
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,800
someone is written down you can put it

385
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,139
into hemingwayapp.com and try to lower

386
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,519
the reading level based on the

387
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,320
suggestions in that tool I added a link

388
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,019
to the slide deck to that avoid Tech

389
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:57,540
jargon where we know about this one and

390
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,100
a lot of people do try to do this when

391
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,420
we talk to people outside of our

392
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,100
industry I would take it one step

393
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,079
farther and say avoid business jargon

394
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,480
and corporate jargon those terms tend to

395
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,040
not translate as well as we think they

396
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,079
do across user groups and where I work

397
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,880
in a government space a lot of people

398
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,860
don't use business jargon at all and

399
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,600
it's confusing to them

400
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,160
when you do need to introduce a

401
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,019
technical term You Can level set in

402
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,360
advance by saying something like do you

403
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,220
already know the word and then say your

404
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,560
phrase give them a chance to say yes or

405
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,360
no first and then explain it if they

406
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,380
don't

407
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,440
use non-judgmental language rather than

408
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,360
calling something bad or another

409
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,760
derogatory word explain the pros and

410
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,279
cons of it try to be precise about what

411
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,660
you're pointing out so that you're not

412
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,240
just expressing judgment around it that

413
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,339
goes tenfold for anything your user

414
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:48,540
currently uses or wants to use

415
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,579
speak at a comfortable pace for your

416
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,800
audience watch for facial expressions

417
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,360
that look worried like wrinkled

418
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,279
foreheads that can mean someone is

419
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,019
concentrating really hard to try to keep

420
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,519
up with you

421
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,920
as for yourself use a neutral facial

422
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,920
expression this comes from my years as a

423
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,680
children's librarian I do not laugh and

424
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,079
I do not smile when people ask me Tech

425
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,139
questions every question is valid and

426
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,660
every question especially a very basic

427
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,279
or an exceptionally strange question

428
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,860
gives you information about what that

429
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,079
person needs to know from you we

430
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,519
sometimes think that a smile will be

431
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,500
reassuring but consider that even a

432
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,600
reassuring smile can convey I know this

433
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,760
answer and you do not as Brienne

434
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,320
mentioned earlier you don't want to give

435
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,820
even the appearance of thinking of

436
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,139
yourself as smarter than the other

437
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,060
person because that is extremely

438
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,279
sensitive and it will be clocked

439
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,500
listen actively repeat back what you're

440
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,660
hearing paraphrase but again be careful

441
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,639
not to use Tech jargon because that will

442
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,620
sound like you're correcting people

443
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,320
and finally celebrate Mastery the first

444
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,720
time I ever felt confident good and

445
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,120
proud when using a Tech Tool was in an

446
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,120
intermediate Excel class I am not an

447
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,120
Excel Master sadly but confident good

448
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,120
and proud is the feeling of Mastery when

449
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,920
I see a user experiencing a feeling of

450
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,800
Mastery I party with them and no matter

451
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,959
how small a thing it's for I saw a user

452
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:11,279
feeling a Mastery because she learned

453
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,680
the keyboard shortcut for paste and we

454
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,779
celebrated her success as a team and she

455
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,480
and I are still a team

456
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,040
question your assumptions about your

457
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,560
users a little humility truly does go a

458
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,360
long way when you don't understand what

459
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,040
your users are doing or why they want

460
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,660
what they want a technique you can try

461
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,820
is the five wise Brienne actually taught

462
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,339
me this one asking why five times can

463
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,139
lead you to the root of a problem I'll

464
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,220
give an example from my library

465
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,320
background there was a tech product that

466
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,480
we bought we failed to adopt as a system

467
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,980
and within a year we canceled the

468
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,440
product why did we fail to adopt it well

469
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,760
staff never made it part of their

470
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,860
workflow why was that we had trouble

471
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,540
training and onboarding everyone who

472
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,880
needed to use it why was that rolling

473
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,860
out new software to busy Frontline staff

474
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,440
is very hard and we did not set aside

475
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,760
enough of everyone's time to make the

476
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,959
training stick

477
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,180
why was that the software wasn't seen as

478
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,040
enough of a priority to take people away

479
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,199
from public service and why was that

480
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,180
well there was one person in leadership

481
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,860
who signed a contract for the software

482
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,720
despite every other person in the room

483
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,000
saying it wasn't a good fit for the

484
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,959
library the answer was lack of buy-in

485
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,639
we're linking in this deck to a great

486
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,800
article on the five wise you can find a

487
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,019
version of it that works for you you

488
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,180
might try using it to ask why you feel

489
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,060
annoyed with your users

490
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,160
I was a librarian for 17 years as I

491
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,420
mentioned and I want to talk to you

492
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,519
about reference interviews when you go

493
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,199
to a library and say can you help me

494
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,060
find a book that is the beginning of a

495
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,920
reference interview in this interaction

496
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,440
a trained librarian is assessing the

497
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,699
words you choose whether there's

498
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,500
hesitation in your voice your body

499
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,899
language your tone the way you approach

500
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,399
them what you're holding in your hands

501
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,680
if there's anyone else with you more

502
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,940
than that

503
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,740
here are some secrets of reference

504
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,120
interviews that you might find helpful

505
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,579
when you talk to users first is the

506
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,740
cover is not blue and it's okay

507
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,720
I've been surprised in the tech World by

508
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,279
how literally people take requests from

509
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,260
users there's a librarian adage about

510
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,299
the book with the blue cover a person

511
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,280
will say I'm looking for a book and all

512
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,720
I remember about it is that the cover

513
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,119
was blue then you do a long reference

514
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,559
interview and you track down the book

515
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,919
and in the end the cover is never blue

516
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,559
asking for things inaccurately is

517
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,020
expected Behavior not because people are

518
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,240
lying or because they're not smart but

519
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,859
because this is the way human brains

520
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,660
work imprecisely

521
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,820
a good reference interview helps a

522
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,799
person form their question

523
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,020
when we work with users we can help them

524
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,360
articulate what they want we can then

525
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,220
use our expertise to guide them toward

526
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,020
available options that resemble what

527
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,820
they want and also help them understand

528
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,520
the technical terms so you are guiding

529
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,340
people toward a request that is workable

530
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,200
tangential lines of questioning I really

531
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,340
like this one

532
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,780
when you're looking for that book book

533
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,340
with the blue cover it's tempting to

534
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,559
keep asking about the cover is there a

535
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,179
picture was it light blue was it dark

536
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,460
blue don't bother the cover is

537
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,740
irrelevant ask questions about something

538
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,200
else when did you read the book in the

539
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,299
70s last year was it a book you were

540
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,679
assigned in school did you get a

541
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,660
Scholastic Book Fair was the main

542
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,760
character an animal or a person

543
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,799
I use a mix of Broad and specific

544
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,960
questions to try to snag on some detail

545
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,760
that triggers a new meaningful memory

546
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,160
something that makes that reader say oh

547
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,480
actually I remember this really

548
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,160
important thing because that's when you

549
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,480
will actually get to the meat of what

550
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,460
you're looking for the same technique

551
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,200
can work for zeroing in on product

552
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,720
requirements

553
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,240
every question is valid a question might

554
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,100
sound silly to you but it is not silly

555
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,320
to the person asking it if you are a

556
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,780
knowledge authority figure chances are

557
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,340
they had to screw up their courage to

558
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,419
ask you

559
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,820
keep that neutral facial expression I

560
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,320
won't tell you not to smile but remember

561
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,360
that a smile can read as condescending I

562
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,500
think I'm even smiling a little bit

563
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,299
right now it's easy to smile when you're

564
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,559
feeling a little nervous or if you're

565
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,480
talking to somebody new it's very easy

566
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,919
to fall into but I'll share that when

567
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,020
I've worked with children I learned very

568
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,640
quickly that you never smile because you

569
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,840
suggest that you think your their

570
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,780
problems are cute or insignificant and

571
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,000
so that's why I bring that tip forward

572
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,980
get to know your users vocabulary and

573
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,080
use it people often adapt their language

574
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,880
in ways they assume make sense to us

575
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,740
when they ask questions so they use

576
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,179
vocabulary they've heard people in our

577
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,160
position use or they focus on a detail

578
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,020
that's related to what they want because

579
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,940
they associate that detail with techie

580
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,720
people

581
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,880
a common example of this in Tech is a

582
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,100
user who insists on a particular feature

583
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,840
but has an inaccurate understanding of

584
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
what it does so they know what outcome

585
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,200
they want but they ask for a thing that

586
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,539
won't get them that outcome why because

587
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:34,919
they're trying to communicate the

588
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,539
outcome to you in what they assume is

589
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,039
your language

590
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,720
so repeating what users said in

591
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,280
paraphrasing in addition to being good

592
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,260
active listening gives them a chance to

593
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,179
edit and refine their ask

594
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,880
and finally be wary of contempt if you

595
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,840
work with people who Express

596
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,120
contemporary user it will serve you well

597
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,799
to be aware of their motivations and to

598
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,059
apply that lens to the work you're

599
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,020
producing

600
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,660
all users are beautiful some are harder

601
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,440
to reach than others

602
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,360
and also just tie your directives to

603
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,740
outcomes that your users value they

604
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,179
might not be the someone the same ones

605
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,440
that you do

606
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,059
um I like tying it to something really

607
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,380
personal related to their own desires

608
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,480
and fears uh less like we're gonna get

609
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,980
rated by the feds and more like you're

610
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,120
going to get a call about this really

611
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,620
late at night and your day is going to

612
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,480
be wrecked people understand that pretty

613
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,520
innately

614
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,559
so takeaways

615
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,660
understand your users motivations and

616
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,799
use them please

617
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,320
mimic their language find them in the

618
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,059
way that they learn match them where

619
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,820
they are and tie it to priorities that

620
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,679
they actually value rather than an

621
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,059
executive said something and so now we

622
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,539
have to do stuff

623
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,320
finally now you know your secret

624
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,820
librarian reference interview techniques

625
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,080
use them to understand the bigger

626
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,820
picture it's okay the cover's not blue

627
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,580
try tangential lines of questioning and

628
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,160
incentivize snacks stickers and also

629
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,140
help people find that sense of Mastery

630
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,880
and help them Master something important

631
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,360
or lucrative to get them on your side

632
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,260
thanks so much
