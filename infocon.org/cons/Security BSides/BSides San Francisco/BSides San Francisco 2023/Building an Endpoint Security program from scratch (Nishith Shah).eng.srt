1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,639
all right let's get started so today I'm

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,380
here to talk about how to build an

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,120
endpoint security program from scratch

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,700
for an organization I got a lot to cover

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,500
here today so let's just quickly get

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,120
started

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,380
so the things that I will be talking

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,020
about today is why it is important to

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,940
have an endpoint security program that

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,039
I'll talk about what are endpoints and

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,380
why determining your scope important

12
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,240
talk about security threats in this

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,119
space program goals creating a maturity

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,760
model talk about identifying your key

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,460
stakeholders and lastly I'll talk about

16
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,440
how the execution on this program would

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,800
look like

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,340
great

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,680
uh so before I dive deep in a topic I

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,320
want to briefly introduce myself my name

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,480
is nished I currently work at Netflix

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,160
where I lead their endpoint security

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,800
program I got it over a decade of

24
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,300
Enterprise security experience by

25
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,860
working in different companies and

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,980
education institutions like Harvard

27
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,440
Salesforce to name a few

28
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,760
all right

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,579
so you must all be wondering like why it

30
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,739
is important why does my company need to

31
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,600
have an endpoint security program why do

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,979
I need to build something I got enough

33
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,420
things to worry about

34
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,700
so the answer is like as you all

35
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,439
probably know in today's day and age

36
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,960
where anybody can work from anywhere and

37
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,060
pretty much use can any of that devices

38
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,700
to access your company resources that's

39
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,400
a huge security risk gone are the days

40
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,439
when people were able to use their

41
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,240
corporate testers in a control settings

42
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,340
and those were the means that they were

43
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,320
able to access your computer resources

44
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,080
now what is pretty much is accessible

45
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,600
from any device at anywhere

46
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,939
so think of it as like your employees

47
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,340
who are constantly using their endpoints

48
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,500
to access your internal data your

49
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
financial data your customer data what

50
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,659
if those endpoints get impacted I'm not

51
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,220
talking about just your company or

52
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,680
devices but your mobile devices your

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,320
tablets your personal devices I know

54
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,659
certain companies companies have a BYOD

55
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,299
policy so if those endpoints gets

56
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,340
compromised all of those things that

57
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,140
your your employees are able to access

58
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,899
are impacted as well that's why it's

59
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,399
really really important to have a

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,959
comprehensive endpoint security program

61
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,739
for your company

62
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,020
let's talk about endpoints so over the

63
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,239
years I heard many different definitions

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,760
of what is an endpoint it seems like

65
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,580
everybody has their own idea of what an

66
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,440
endpoint is so I just want to kind of

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,819
get the fact straightened out and maybe

68
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,379
get everybody in the same page here

69
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,959
where as I see it and I think most of

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,300
you will agree with me here is an

71
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,220
endpoint is any device that is

72
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,780
connecting and exchanging information

73
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,879
with your network it's as simple as that

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,160
some of the endpoints that you can think

75
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,959
of is your like physical servers your

76
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,480
virtual servers your mobile device your

77
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,060
tablets your laptops even your smart

78
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,099
devices such as your printers your smart

79
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,680
watches everything is an endpoint in my

80
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,980
work I also seen like people

81
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,879
misrepresenting endpoints such as that

82
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,620
you have API endpoints in your company

83
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,959
those are not technically your endpoints

84
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,280
I'm talking about more which is

85
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,140
exchanging information through devices

86
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,160
and stuff like that

87
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,420
so with that in mind there are some

88
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,040
things that are some sort of a prep work

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,239
that we need to do for the

90
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,920
implementation of this program which is

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,720
really critical for the success that

92
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,159
you're trying to build here

93
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,500
the first thing in this prep work is

94
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,659
scope you need to determine your scope

95
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,540
as early as possible as I was mentioning

96
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,580
you earlier in the previous slide there

97
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,260
are many different kinds of endpoints

98
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,360
available in the market you have your

99
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,800
traditional endpoints such as your

100
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,440
desktops laptops tablets you have your

101
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,120
non-traditional endpoints such as your

102
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,120
printers cameras Etc you need to

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,760
identify your scope online program it

104
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,019
will help you with couple of things

105
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,900
first it will help you prioritize on

106
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,599
maybe like kind of Envision you where

107
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,879
your risk lies within the company and

108
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,440
also help you understand which

109
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,299
Technologies and processes you need to

110
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,819
invest in to either reduce or eliminate

111
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,459
this risk let's say that in your company

112
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,920
your company has a policy where they are

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,019
allowing company owned devices such as

114
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,420
Macs and windows to be used for a

115
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,700
company resources along with use of

116
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,040
personal mobile devices so if that's the

117
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,599
case and those are the devices that you

118
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,180
want to secure that becomes your scope

119
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,279
if your company has in top of what I

120
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,500
just mentioned how BYOD policy where

121
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,478
people are allowed to use their personal

122
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,699
laptops desktops to access company

123
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,280
resources if you want to secure those

124
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,680
then that becomes a scope as well so try

125
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,780
to determine what your what devices are

126
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,639
allowed in your company and identify

127
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,199
those as a scope

128
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,880
the other really cool thing about

129
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,040
identifying this earlier on it will help

130
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,960
you make informed decisions throughout

131
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,520
your program which will be really

132
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,320
crucial for the success of the outcome

133
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,400
of what you're trying to do here

134
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
the second thing that you want to do

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
here is identifying and documenting all

136
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,919
your security threads based on the

137
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,780
business that you are that your company

138
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,820
is doing working on based on the scope

139
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,440
or the devices that they are allowing

140
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,780
based on their company's culture you

141
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,940
need to identify and document all the

142
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,680
security threats that are applicable to

143
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,320
you and your company in this piece if

144
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,880
you need help you will need to you can

145
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
reach out to your partners as well you

146
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,540
can work with your legal team your

147
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,820
detection team your compliance team and

148
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,199
they will also be able to help you

149
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,240
identify all the security threats that

150
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,040
you are seeing in the space for the

151
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,880
company

152
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,680
solar security threats that I've seen

153
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,139
that applicable uh data leakage data

154
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,639
compromise you have your credential

155
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,919
compromise you see disruption of service

156
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,259
is happening because of a compromised

157
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:33,900
endpoint so think of it again like this

158
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,300
is not a comprehension list of all the

159
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,220
threads that you see in this place and

160
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,720
your threads may be different from what

161
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,820
I mentioned here so I really really

162
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,500
recommend you work with the internal

163
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,539
teams and try to find out all the

164
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:46,860
security threats that you see in your

165
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,020
company

166
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,419
next you need to identify and document

167
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,820
your program goals at this point you

168
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,380
have identified your scope you have

169
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,660
identified your security threats based

170
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,039
on that you need to identify and

171
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,560
document all your goals to start to

172
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,780
Define your think of video show as your

173
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,060
program goes as a short-term goal that

174
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,680
you want to achieve let's say in an ear

175
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,139
or so then think of your long-term goals

176
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,699
that you want to achieve in less than

177
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,280
three to five years as an example if you

178
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,020
want to implement something like a

179
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,240
device zero trust in your company and

180
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,740
which will roughly take you a couple of

181
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,300
years or three years to implement

182
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,100
everything then that becomes your

183
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,740
long-term goal here and I'll talk more

184
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,419
about this device your trust in a future

185
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,060
slide so bear with me for a minute and

186
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,500
in terms of short term like if you

187
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,180
recognize that hey I don't have a good

188
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,100
asset inventory and that I want to solve

189
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,380
first before I go do my device zero

190
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,539
trust and well that will probably take

191
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,520
me a couple of years then that becomes

192
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,680
your short-term goal so try to identify

193
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,419
where your gaps are what were you trying

194
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,979
to go with your endpoints what your

195
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:48,840
endpoint final state looks like and try

196
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,600
to to determine your goals earlier on

197
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,039
the other thing I recommend while

198
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,199
identifying your goals is also have some

199
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,180
kind of tracking in place which is

200
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,680
tracking you will be able to do couple

201
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,479
of things one is you'll be able to

202
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,580
measure the progress that you are going

203
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,620
to be making which of these goals and

204
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,139
second it also help you envision what

205
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,120
whether you'll be able to achieve this

206
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,740
course in the committed time frame or

207
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,860
not so have apart from identifying goals

208
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,539
also has some kind of tracking in place

209
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,639
as well

210
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,099
next I highly recommend you create a

211
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,479
maturity model for the endpoint

212
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:22,860
something like actually shown inside

213
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,620
here as well so creating a maturity

214
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,240
model will help you really understand

215
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,039
where you currently stand in terms of

216
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,440
maturity for your endpoints as you

217
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,000
probably would know that you may be more

218
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,160
mature in some part of your controls in

219
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,680
endpoints and less showing on us so have

220
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,240
this kind of maturity model created

221
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,039
while you are implementing or designing

222
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,180
this program

223
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,520
apart from her assessing on giving you

224
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,380
the idea of where you currently stand it

225
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,599
can also pinpoint where you have the

226
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,160
biggest caps within a certain control

227
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,080
and that's where you will be able to

228
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,240
kind of prioritize get your resources to

229
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
fetch those caps first

230
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,800
as you see in this slides I've included

231
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,259
an example where on the leftmost side

232
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,240
you have some of the controls that you

233
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,520
may want to implement for this space and

234
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,680
then I've defined various levels for

235
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,940
each of this

236
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,740
when you think about that implementing

237
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,960
something you may not be able to go from

238
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,599
0 to 100 in one go for some of these

239
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,880
controls you may be trying to reach some

240
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,560
milestones and you may be already there

241
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,840
in certain ways of form and that's where

242
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,220
you kind of want to achieve your final

243
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,280
goal so this lever labels are defined in

244
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,900
that way where you have your Milestones

245
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,580
which are represented by level zero

246
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,379
level one level two and then you have

247
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,000
your final goal position level three

248
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,020
here

249
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,179
apart from getting your assessing your

250
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,500
current state through this maturity

251
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,958
model you will also be able to Envision

252
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,120
what your final and point state would

253
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,580
look like here let's say you implemented

254
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,260
all these controls and you are at the

255
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,300
final level of this level three that's

256
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,160
what your final endpoint state would

257
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,600
look like you can communicate to your

258
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,459
leadership team your other teams that

259
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,440
this is what I want to achieve in let's

260
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,060
say three years and four years if I'm

261
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,680
able to do everything what I mentioned

262
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,160
to do here

263
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,980
lastly in this section it's going to be

264
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,260
stakeholder Management try to identify

265
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,420
your key stakeholders as early as

266
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,060
possible you will not be able to go

267
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,560
further in this process without your

268
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,480
help of your key stakeholders so I

269
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,860
highly recommend you spend some time

270
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,380
identify your key stakeholders and get

271
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,000
some commitment in times in terms of

272
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,160
time and resources to help you out with

273
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,839
the implementations program

274
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,820
I'm not saying that it's going to be an

275
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,140
easy ride and everybody's going to agree

276
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,640
with you from day one like hey yeah

277
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,500
let's do this thing let's Implement I'm

278
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,060
gonna give you all the resources you

279
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,040
will have your own challenges if you do

280
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,959
that don't be don't be worried about it

281
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,580
talk to your managers talk to your

282
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,500
executive sponsors talk to their teams

283
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,899
for that matter and try to find a male

284
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,820
ground why they are hesitating and do

285
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,380
not not committing resources on what

286
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,180
you're trying to solve here

287
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,800
so all the teams that I've worked in the

288
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,779
past came from my security team my Co-op

289
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,420
ID team my support teams my legal that's

290
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,100
where I found my gym that's where I

291
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,680
found my All-Star team members so these

292
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,180
members are going to be around and you

293
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,160
need to kind of find out and work with

294
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,860
them as a bonus some of my current and

295
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,860
former Star members are present in this

296
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,019
Cloud here as well so you shut off to

297
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,760
all of them they know who they are so

298
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,220
thank you for everything that they did

299
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,380
uh apart from identifying key

300
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,640
stakeholders

301
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,899
um I highly recommend you build

302
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,459
strategic Partnerships with your

303
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,740
partners as well there may be for

304
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,360
example a different group within a

305
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,980
company who's trying to solve a

306
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,019
different problem than yours but they

307
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,519
want to implement a similar set of

308
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,260
Technologies processes on what you're

309
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,839
trying to do here so try to identify

310
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,060
opportunities like this and work closely

311
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,720
with them as as much as possible it will

312
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,880
help you achieve tools and one it will

313
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,160
help you maximize the use of your

314
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,620
resources efficiency voice and second it

315
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,300
will help you reach your goals in a much

316
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,399
faster way so try to do this kind of

317
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,540
stuff when you're trying to think about

318
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,760
your key stakeholders when trying to

319
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,140
build these strategic Partnerships

320
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,940
all right so in the execution let's say

321
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,680
you did everything you did all your

322
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,540
scope identification you did all your

323
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,160
security threads you found out what

324
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,959
those are you found your key

325
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,180
stakeholders and got commitment let's

326
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,860
talk about how the execution of this

327
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,740
program would look like

328
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,839
the first step in this process is

329
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,480
getting and creating uh accurate asset

330
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,640
inventory for a company it's all the

331
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,959
devices that are connecting your

332
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,880
organization and which are being able to

333
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,860
access your resources you need to have

334
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,380
an asset inventory for your company

335
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,300
it's not saying right like you won't be

336
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,920
able to secure devices that you don't

337
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,899
know of and that's basically precisely

338
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,640
this asset inventory will help you out

339
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,540
with

340
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,339
this asset inventory will help you out

341
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,980
with two key things one it will help you

342
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,140
better understand your uh thread

343
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,120
landscape for a company and we also help

344
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,980
you understand and design security

345
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,779
controls that you need to implement

346
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,540
based on those thread landscape so try

347
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,760
to identify try to have an accurate

348
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,640
asset inventory as quickly as possible

349
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,740
if you don't have one try to work with

350
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,300
your partnership or try to work with

351
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,180
your it team your procurement team your

352
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,100
HR team and they will also be able to

353
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,500
help you set up tools and process in

354
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,480
place to help you get a better asset

355
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,240
inventory there are also many tools that

356
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,980
are available now in the market you have

357
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,899
your agent base which gets deployed on

358
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,579
all the devices through which you are

359
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,560
able to collect device Telemetry and

360
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,360
that becomes your foundation for your

361
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,220
asset inventory then you have your

362
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,720
network based agents which are

363
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,459
constantly scanning your network traffic

364
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,220
and based on their trying to infer your

365
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,959
device level information

366
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,000
and lastly you have your browser

367
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,240
extension based uh softwares available

368
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,040
which are installed on all your browsers

369
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,959
and will also be able to work in a

370
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,519
similar way as your agent built where

371
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,380
we're trying that where they're able to

372
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,899
collect device level information for the

373
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,300
for asset inventory the one benefit that

374
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,279
I see with browser based is those are

375
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,839
really lightweight if you're worried

376
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,880
about your performance and things like

377
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,040
that that comes with agent this is the

378
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,360
solution that you might want to look

379
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,540
into

380
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,459
the second thing I want to mention here

381
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,860
is prioritization you need to have some

382
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,779
kind of prioritization methodology when

383
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:07,860
you're trying to implement something

384
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,240
from this program

385
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,100
it's really important to have this

386
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,680
method so that you are able to have your

387
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,660
resources used in a more efficient way

388
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,579
so that you can bring down your risk for

389
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,160
the company in a more meaningful way one

390
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,720
of the prioritization methods that are

391
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,000
used in the past is through a risk-based

392
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,700
approach where I try to identify my

393
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,220
riskiest users in my company I try to

394
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,260
look at things like what teams that they

395
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,880
are part of what position they are in

396
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,980
what kind of access they have I look

397
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,019
into my security factors like hey is

398
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,600
this user been when I was trying to do a

399
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,459
phishing exercise how many times the

400
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,920
users have failed this exercise what are

401
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,899
the security incidents and threats that

402
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,820
have happened in my company and what

403
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,560
uses that part of that thing and what

404
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,120
caused this incident in the first place

405
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,519
so try to work with your partner try to

406
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,839
work with your detection team through

407
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,639
thread Intel team and they will be able

408
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,920
to help you pull up these numbers

409
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,079
second in the list I try to identify my

410
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:02,760
riskiest device I tried to look for

411
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,800
whether the device is a personal loan or

412
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,180
company or whether it's enrolled in

413
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,100
endpoint management or not what security

414
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,899
tools are present what kind of data

415
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,000
expression does it have any secrets on

416
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,980
it if those answers come yes then that

417
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,620
becomes my risque device I try to

418
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,300
combine these two data like you have

419
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,519
your scaled user with your skills device

420
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,160
and that gives you a prioritization list

421
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,500
the main beauty of this thing is you

422
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,180
don't have to use this prioritization

423
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,120
just for your endpoint related stuff you

424
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,740
may be having your different initiatives

425
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,839
like you may be looking for compliance

426
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,160
training you may be looking for

427
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,139
passwordless in your company you can

428
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,120
pretty much use the same method for

429
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,380
other initiatives as well

430
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,820
third thing in this list is endpoint

431
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,680
management so for folks who doesn't know

432
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,779
it's a process of managing and securing

433
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,060
your endpoints the process is really

434
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,100
important as it will help you secure

435
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,600
your information that's stored on the

436
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,000
device and the device itself as well

437
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,980
there are many commercial of the shell

438
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,420
products available now in the market so

439
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,639
you need to reinvent the whole bill like

440
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,639
JF and intunes and Google MDM but these

441
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,740
products are really specific to the osis

442
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,959
that they support so if your company is

443
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:12,240
only using Mac and windows then you can

444
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,040
pretty much use like jamf and into your

445
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,839
angle MDM will not work because it only

446
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,380
supports on Chromebooks so it's really

447
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,540
critical to identify your scope and the

448
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,820
asset inventory earlier on that can help

449
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,920
you make informed decisions just like

450
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,839
this what products you need to buy what

451
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,579
technologies will be supported on your

452
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:30,779
devices

453
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,120
there's a common notion that mdms are

454
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,860
generally used for increasing

455
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,779
productivity for zero touch Provisions

456
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,940
but can also do much more things than

457
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,560
that it can help you with your Fleet

458
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,540
visibility it can help you build your

459
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,399
secure by default controls it can help

460
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,920
you for incident response activities the

461
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,480
other thing it can help you out with too

462
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,880
is doing a remote lock and wire let's

463
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,920
say in an event or an employee loses

464
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,779
their device or a cell phone in a

465
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,279
conference on a train or something

466
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,620
happens you can issue a remote lock and

467
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,240
why whatever you want to do at that

468
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,339
point an MDM is a solution that can help

469
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,120
you out with that

470
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,459
the next thing is security tools and

471
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,620
configuration let's say you identify

472
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,000
some of the secured biggest security

473
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,980
threats in your company and you are in

474
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,600
the process of either eliminating or

475
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,940
reducing it so you may be looking at hey

476
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,339
I want to implement a new control or a

477
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:21,899
new process or a new configuration

478
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:24,300
before you dive deep into that process

479
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,040
of researching a new vendor or the new

480
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,199
conflicts or something like that try to

481
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,240
gather enough requirements or all the

482
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,320
requirements from all your key

483
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,600
stakeholders I'm not just talking about

484
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,639
security requirements here I know we are

485
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,680
a security person here but there are

486
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,000
also like different kind of requirements

487
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,079
you have your operational level

488
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,579
requirements you have your performance

489
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,680
level requirements so try to work with

490
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,060
your system engineering team your

491
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,680
support teams who are going to be

492
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,779
impacted with this new uh changes that

493
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,339
you're trying to over and gather all

494
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,680
those requirements earlier on

495
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,300
let's say you've done all those stuff

496
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,519
and you are able to identify all your

497
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,440
key requirements the next step in the

498
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,839
process is to identify your key vendors

499
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,880
like which vendors are able to solve

500
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,099
this problem and trying to go after and

501
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,500
which of them are able to satisfy most

502
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,140
of my requirements while doing research

503
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,119
it's very common that you may not find a

504
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,740
single vendor and that's okay you can

505
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,839
work with the engineering team go get

506
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,339
those built in-house and that's the

507
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,619
whole notion behind like buy versus Bill

508
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,240
like if it's something available it's

509
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,459
it's appropriate you may want to go with

510
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,140
that and it's not you may want to build

511
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,179
something custom in-house there's

512
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,919
nothing wrong with each of them there's

513
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,780
only like pros and cons with each of

514
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,720
them so then you so you just need to

515
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,160
confirm with those like what is going to

516
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,960
make more sense for you

517
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,900
after you identify a key a couple of

518
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,820
vendors that gonna help you out with

519
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,400
this problem try to run a quick POC try

520
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,080
to test it out on your testing machine

521
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,059
and see if everything is working as

522
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:50,220
intended or not there may be things that

523
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,320
may not be able to some men are not able

524
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,600
to satisfy versus somebody who's trying

525
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,400
to get you may be able to solve your

526
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
problem but not able to satisfy some of

527
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,179
the requirements so try to run a quick

528
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,120
POC and see which one vendor makes sense

529
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,919
for you

530
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,960
still this is not a time to even go for

531
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,059
diploma and it still has one step to go

532
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:11,160
here which is the testing phase where

533
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,039
try to find your diverse sets of users

534
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,840
and devices through which you want to

535
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,580
implement something try to collect as

536
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,980
much feedback as possible so that you

537
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,480
are able to test thoroughly before

538
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,600
you're trying to implement something

539
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,760
and the last step in this process is

540
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,160
deployment when are we trying to you

541
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,660
gather everything you got the

542
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,520
requirements you identify your tool your

543
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,740
vendor you did testing now is the time

544
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,480
to communicate that's the most crucial

545
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,820
step in trying to implement something

546
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,340
I've seen many projects feel in many

547
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,380
organizations before because they were

548
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,960
not communicated properly so the way to

549
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,240
think about this is whenever trying to

550
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,520
communicate something I at least I plan

551
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,500
to send out like three to five rounds of

552
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,660
different communication to my Workforce

553
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,360
I send out one a month before second one

554
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,100
a couple of books weeks before and the

555
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,720
third one a day before the final

556
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,700
deployment it will help you with couple

557
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,980
of things it will a help your Workforce

558
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,320
to raise any issues and concerns within

559
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,360
the time frame and B it will also give

560
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,100
you enough time to resolve those issues

561
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,620
before any deployments are happening

562
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,179
apart from communication and

563
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,039
documentation is also really important

564
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,320
where you need to make it really easily

565
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,600
available and easy to understand a lot

566
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,220
of people miss that step so I just want

567
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,500
to kind of highlight that here as well

568
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,660
The Next Step here is to do a staggered

569
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,400
deployment never do a deployment to

570
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,679
enter Workforce in a single go as I

571
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,059
generally do it I generally first

572
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:35,700
deployed on my early test results first

573
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,740
then I try to collect feedback and see

574
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,360
how things are operating you may have

575
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,340
missed a few things during your testing

576
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,620
during a POC and this is an excellent

577
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,240
opportunity where you can find some

578
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,220
stuff before you're doing your map like

579
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,440
larger level deployment

580
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,299
after you're done with that I try and

581
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,620
generally try to stagger it through

582
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,539
beans like I first deployed on my 10

583
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,520
percent of my population and see how

584
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,260
things are operating and try to repeat

585
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,480
the same cycle of feedback after I'm

586
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,220
done with that I try to report on my 30

587
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,559
percent it's if it's good I try to move

588
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,000
on to the next 60 percent of my

589
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,160
Workforce so try to stagger it as much

590
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,799
as much as possible your supportings are

591
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,179
going to be really thankful to you if

592
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:15,140
you do this kind of stuff

593
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,980
um lastly I want to talk about the

594
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,620
device zero trust this is a process of

595
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,020
making sure that your device is under

596
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,700
really good healthy State before they

597
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,280
are able to access your application as

598
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,080
an industry in my opinion I need to move

599
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,360
we need to move away from securing all

600
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,280
the devices with the same level of

601
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,740
scrutiny but so we need to be more

602
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,020
pragmatic with our approach if a device

603
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,820
is only accessing your sensory

604
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,160
application then it's okay to have like

605
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,360
higher stringent level security

606
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,760
requirements but if it's only accessing

607
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,860
low key level application with nothing

608
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,200
in it then it's okay to have certain

609
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,940
leeway with certain low level of

610
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,620
security requirements and we need to

611
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,360
think about that you know at a broader

612
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,559
level

613
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,360
for folks who doesn't know your trust

614
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,679
the high level process looks something

615
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,900
like this where you first try to add

616
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,880
document and identify your device level

617
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,500
security requirements that you want to

618
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,660
apply for your devices click second

619
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,340
after you identify those things you

620
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,500
apply it with your identity provider for

621
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,120
all the applications that you want to

622
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,460
secure in the first place and lastly it

623
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,980
is at the assessment level when a device

624
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,200
is trying to access something or a

625
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,179
particular application you're basically

626
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,100
checking the security requirements for

627
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,500
those devices and based on that you

628
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,299
either allowing or denying access to

629
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,799
those applications

630
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,620
this is a really 10 000 feet view it's

631
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,720
really high level obviously it's much

632
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,460
more complex than this but you get the

633
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,320
idea of how it will look for your

634
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,799
organization

635
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,200
um lastly I know I talk about a lot of

636
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,159
these things

637
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,500
um in very detail so if you want to take

638
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,900
just a few bullet points a key few key

639
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,299
takeaways from you from this

640
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,760
presentation is this first thing to

641
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,320
maintain and have an accurate asset

642
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,760
inventory it will help you with your

643
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,679
thread landscape it will help you design

644
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,360
and Implement your security controls

645
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,380
properly

646
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,360
second you will not be able to make a

647
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,159
lot of progressing and handedly so try

648
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,840
to identify your key stakeholders

649
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,520
earlier in the process and get

650
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,020
commitment in terms of time and

651
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,280
resources

652
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,380
thirdly don't let Perfection be your

653
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,240
enemy getting hundred percent in this

654
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,520
space is really really hard so try to

655
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,320
work with your manager your compliance

656
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,780
team and see what is the risk value that

657
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,820
makes sense for you and try to use that

658
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,559
as a number when you're trying to Define

659
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,000
your goals

660
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,400
fourth do not try to boil the ocean here

661
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,020
have some kind of prioritization

662
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,480
methodology maybe that's your risk case

663
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,460
device is your users whatever that may

664
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,500
be try to prioritize that work and don't

665
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,020
try to solve everything at once

666
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,360
fifth test thoroughly it's very

667
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,980
