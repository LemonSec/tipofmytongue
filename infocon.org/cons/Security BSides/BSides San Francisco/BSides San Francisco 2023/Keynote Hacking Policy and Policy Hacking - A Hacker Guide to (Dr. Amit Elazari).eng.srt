sorry

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,259
this is still the Intel machine so I'm

40
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,060
like you're getting all the Intel

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,100
vulnerabilities here here we go we heard

42
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,180
that noise

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,119
yes Dean we got it

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,920
um

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,180
I just need the clicker

46
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,140
here we go good

47
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,739

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,980
present here

57
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,020
um well this is as I said I'm a meta

58
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,760
lazari this is going to be a fast ride

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,220
into the universe of cyber policy law

60
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,560
but I first want to tell you why I'm

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,440
here so a little bit about me I'm

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,879
actually a lawyer but I'm not your

63
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,280
lawyer today is not legal advice but I'm

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,920
also technical at an Intel uh which I'm

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,660
gonna leave by the way mesh first is my

66
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,459
last day at Intel

67
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,500
um I'm also a principal engineer so it's

68
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,360
a bit confusing I guess I'm a little bit

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,640
of all my background is legal and

70
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,160
Technical obviously I'm Israeli I spent

71
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,840
some time in the Israeli intelligence

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,819
forces where I hack things that I cannot

73
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,340
talk about then I I moved to work in

74
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,739
another semiconductor industry a very

75
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,900
important one photovoltaics were a

76
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,319
designed solar power stations then I

77
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,720
decided that I loved the law so much

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,879
that I have four degrees three of them

79
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,280
in the law Y is a very good question I

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
agree with you all you're going to hear

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,700
a little bit about it today but I went

82
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,519
to reichmann University where I still

83
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,800
teach Cyber Law today in the master

84
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,780
program

85
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,180
and then I decided that I also need to

86
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,860
practice law because that's the process

87
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,019
in Israel and I became a big law and M a

88
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,480
lawyer so I went I helped startups and

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,700
this is of all size one of my biggest

90
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,099
Acquisitions was Annapurna he had a

91
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,140
cheap company yes there is a theme in my

92
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,140
life I like I guess I love hardware

93
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,879
and I help them with their acquisition

94
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,640
but then an opportunity arise to become

95
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,739
I guess the first Israeli student that

96
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,299
got accepted to the direct tract

97
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:03,060
doctoral law program in Berkeley now why

98
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,760
Berkeley because it's full of hackers so

99
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,860
I spent most of my time at Berkeley with

100
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,780
hackers it's also the best technology

101
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,959
Law School in the world and 2018 I

102
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,480
graduated at Berkeley with the help of

103
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,940
all of you here and you will learn how

104
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,639
so my passion is this intersection

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,820
between policy engineering innovation

106
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,699
technology hacking and law and I know

107
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,160
these are a lot of words but my goal

108
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,320
today is to show you how all of you

109
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,419
right here some of you in the room are

110
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,680
already policy hackers right and what

111
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,199
does it mean to engage in this universe

112
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,560
of Cyber Law and cyber policies and why

113
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,840
you should embark on this complicated

114
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,900
Journey so this is as I said a journey

115
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,060
into space we're going to land on a few

116
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,800
planets and as I promised in the

117
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,600
abstract we're gonna have some guests

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,639
speakers because when you go into space

119
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,919
you don't know which aliens which

120
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,620
Adventures which laws you're gonna come

121
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,919
into okay so I already told you that I'm

122
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,020
passionate about law and I spent some

123
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,479
time in that beautiful University at

124
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,639
Berkeley but I didn't tell you what I

125
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,220
did there so first of all I decided that

126
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,860
it's very cool to see how hacking

127
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,759
methods and operating systems of Android

128
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,940
can potentially at scale find Copper

129
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,419
violations so Copa is a Privacy Law

130
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,180
who here saw the Silicon Valley episode

131
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,039
on Coppa forty thousand dollars per

132
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,740
violation she has something some knots

133
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,840
um it's a very important law it protects

134
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,360
children privacy online

135
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,280
um it's gone for summer Visions but one

136
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,320
of the biggest complexities that we have

137
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,360
in the policy and law landscape is how

138
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,580
do we enforce it and here's the first

139
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,740
area where we see the aid of technology

140
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,680
and hackers hackers are helping us to

141
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,639
enforce the law in fact technology is a

142
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,699
strong enabler and a positioning of

143
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,039
policy and laws and Technology as

144
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,460
Lawrence lessig tells us and code can be

145
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,280
policy too so I spent some time working

146
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
on that uh that's how I got my first bug

147
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,919
Bounty it's not my own uh this was

148
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,660
co-authored with some brilliant Hackers

149
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,620
from ixy Professor Serge egoman team

150
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,780
resulted in ten thousand dollars from

151
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,060
Facebook and meta and five thousand

152
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,160
dollars from Google but also a

153
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,960
settlement with Google by the Attorney

154
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,979
General of New Mexico in 120 million

155
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,560
dollars so I guess the combination of

156
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,080
technology and enforcement can get a

157
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,880
little bit powerful but the cool stuff

158
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,160
is we took the five fifteen thousand

159
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,199
hundred dollars and we went to Tao and

160
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,880
we skied there and that's what I did

161
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,300
after RSA 2018 and guess what as opposed

162
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,699
to my friends uh experience I did not

163
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:55,860
break any knees and any bone so that was

164
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,539
really cool if you want to check that

165
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,120
out that's absensis but this is where I

166
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,340
first got to kind of know the joy of

167
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,440
working with hackers and what can we

168
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,780
achieve if we do if we take policy and

169
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,060
hackers and computer scientists on the

170
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,520
same paper obviously I was an academic

171
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,100
so this is a paper too it got the usenix

172
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,319
I think paper award as well as the pets

173
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,300
paperwork and that's pretty cool but

174
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,979
what's most important it taught me about

175
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,620
the value of back bounties so this is my

176
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,360
first Bounty is actually a data abuse

177
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,639
back Bounty which made me think already

178
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,360
in 2017 about this interesting concept

179
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,940
Sven where are you raise your hand I

180
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,220
told you guest speakers coming at you

181
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,020
Defcon 2023 hopefully the biggest

182
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,139
hacking event for AI ever yes an

183
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,139
algorithmic bug Bounty guess what we can

184
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,300
bring back bounties to algorithms

185
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,120
because the part of the crowd is not

186
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,460
confined to security and we're going to

187
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,020
talk about it when Harley is going to

188
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,060
talk about anti-hacking laws and you

189
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,520
will see that a lot of the case law and

190
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,620
papers coming from security research

191
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,139
have a lot in common with algorithmic

192
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,360
Auditors with researchers that are

193
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,580
uncovering issues in privacy and in data

194
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,500
so I invite you to think about security

195
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,319
and Cyber Law as a piece in a much

196
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,139
broader domain enabling the crowd the

197
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,080
hackers the thinkers and above all

198
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,479
openness and transparency

199
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,620
but of course I'm a lawyer so not

200
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,080
Thriller but a lawyer so I fell in love

201
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,879
with contracts and I wrote my entire

202
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,820
dissertation at Berkeley on very long

203
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,599
contracts in fact 2018 I studied I stood

204
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,458
here and I said yeah I'm that person

205
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,740
that reads those terms of use

206
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,200
guess what I also have a hacker sister

207
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,620
and my sister tells me all about the

208
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,080
power of hackers as she said as she

209
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,560
standed on the Ted stage in 2014 by the

210
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,839
way friend Mentor inspiration my best

211
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,420
friend in the world many thanks to Karen

212
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,180
who is the reason why I'm in cyber so

213
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,339
it's a very important lesson she tells

214
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,140
me about bug hunters and their

215
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,480
challenges she tells me about hackers

216
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,940
and the power of security researchers

217
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,700
and since I'm already obsessed with very

218
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,040
long contracts

219
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,339
I start to investigate this phenomena of

220
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,339
bug bounties right so how many bug

221
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,959
hunters in the room I know a couple

222
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,200
don't be shy yes you yes how many

223
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,300
security researchers that got a bounty

224
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,019
maybe not full-time couple bug bounties

225
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,980
are this amazing phenomena where we as

226
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,260
corporations organizations all the way

227
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,540
from Intel to Starbucks to Silicon

228
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,940
Valley Giants in the 90s

229
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,279
to the Pentagon and I see you here my

230
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,779
friend jack cable one of the first

231
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,480
Teenage hackers to hack the Pentagon

232
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,220
to U.S government

233
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,279
to the European Union Leverage The Power

234
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,399
of hackers at scale to not only allow

235
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,320
them to report vulnerabilities and get

236
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,920
time and get money for their time but

237
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,100
for me create the first legal

238
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,320
more legal environment where hackers can

239
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,560
truly celebrate their skill set with

240
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,839
maybe just a little bit less of being

241
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,399
legal threatened

242
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,959
so

243
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,380
I get to know and I I'm impressed and

244
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,019
I'm I just get fascinated by these

245
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,180
amazing human beings like this friend of

246
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,339
mine right here chat cable

247
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,940
and the power that that Community can

248
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,740
have and what they find

249
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,019
and how it inspires them

250
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,540
but above all what we can learn from

251
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,839
them and what lawyers and policy makers

252
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,120
can learn from them and guess what what

253
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,220
lawyers and policy makers should be

254
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,800
doing for them and maybe how they can

255
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,140
also become policy makers

256
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,279
so

257
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,200
naturally after you read a lot of

258
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,839
contracts of bug bounties and you read a

259
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,000
lot about cyber crime and computer crime

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
laws you get to know this law the cfaa

261
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,399
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

262
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,399
The prominent federal law in the United

263
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,680
States for anti-hacking with criminal

264
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,420
and civil liability for unauthorized

265
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,560
access there are a couple more like the

266
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,940
DMC you're going to hear all about it

267
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,579
from my friend Harley here is one of the

268
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,140
best lawyers and policy people in the

269
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,519
world for that

270
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,279
and I discovered that back Bounty

271
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,260
contracts create a little bit of

272
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,200
liability at the time this is 2015. for

273
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,959
hackers why because the sandbag Bounty

274
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,760
program contractor tells you please hack

275
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,500
and I will pay for the vulnerability

276
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,260
refers to the end user license agreement

277
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,500
that says what don't hack me not the

278
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
great solution so obviously you know

279
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,079
remember I'm a law student what do I do

280
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,779
I write a very long paper with a lot of

281
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,760
footnotes and it has to be 50 pages

282
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,800
because I'm writing my dissertation in

283
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,480
the law that's what I do

284
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,839
but is it enough to do change no I am

285
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
talking with Karen and as a true

286
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,459
aspiring hacker I create a guitar page

287
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,279
now I have a guitar page and in my Gita

288
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,040
page I have contracts guess what yes

289
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,980
it's a repo with contracts

290
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,320
and then as a true hacker I create a

291
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,260
hall of fame for what for bug Bounty

292
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,420
contracts that have slightly better

293
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,519
protections for hackers we call that the

294
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,260
legal set Harbor

295
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,540
that's enough that's like me I meet you

296
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,279
know I'm doing papers that's not enough

297
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,779
for a difference and Taylor tells me

298
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,680
come to Defcon meet Casey meet Wendy me

299
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,740
Jack me Jason meet all my friends meets

300
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,019
van the hacker community

301
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,720
you have something here you're just a

302
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,060
student but maybe they will help you so

303
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,459
I do a little bit of that and as I enjoy

304
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,820
speaking I start doing the show and I

305
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,980
tell the hackers we need to fix this

306
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,200
this is not enough

307
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,139
and I come to besides my first talk ever

308
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,760
it's embarrassing

309
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,100
you should hear my accent

310
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,880
too fast not the best Peak not the best

311
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,500
speech not the best talk check it out

312
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,959
online 2017

313
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,820
this is Defcon

314
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,000
first question I get but at me this is

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,399
so theoretical who would ever want to

316
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,079
sue someone who is participating in a

317
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,120
bug Bounty right they're in a bug Bounty

318
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,579
who would ever threaten illegal you know

319
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,560
who would ever send the legal letter to

320
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,440
a hacker in a bug Bounty well you can

321
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,720
check out the 2018 I told them in the

322
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,480
room don't wait for it it will happen

323
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,880
guess what it happened that's a preview

324
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
check out the full talk if you want to

325
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,300
hear about it

326
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,420
but I come here to b-sides and this is

327
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,519
why I'm telling you all of you in the

328
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,339
room are already policy hackers because

329
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,680
when I was a student I came for this

330
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,839
room for help and the room has provided

331
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,560
the community came together and when I

332
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,600
sat here and I said

333
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,940
and we need to change this and you have

334
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,279
the power to change this policy reality

335
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,380
and the details don't matter that's not

336
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,820
the message there you can go online and

337
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,459
find all the Nuance somehow the cfaa and

338
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,380
the dmca and the contracts and over that

339
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,240
all that created the situation here's

340
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,300
what matter the community has the power

341
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,880
and if we engage in the conversation

342
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,940
if we open and educate and make

343
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,820
everybody aware and explain to them

344
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,300
where are they at why policy and laws

345
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,200
matter

346
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,079
they would engage and this with the

347
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,720
power of Casey disclose IO and all of

348
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,760
you in the room has garnered some

349
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,779
results

350
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,899
so this is Mr student look at me with my

351
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,000
gear Beckley law through Defcon you know

352
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,800
hacker t-shirt my sister told me never

353
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,660
wear a suit for hacker conference no I'm

354
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,040
joking she told me be yourself and

355
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,899
celebrated and I'm doing this today with

356
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,480
my red jacket but you can check it all

357
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,060
online but here's what's interesting and

358
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,120
I'm actually going to take a moment

359
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,500
to do this because I think it's a very

360
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,240
interesting illustration

361
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,560
let's see if it works

362
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,540
you probably can't hear it you know you

363
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,399
can't hear it okay so you're just gonna

364
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,300
have to trust me on this check out

365
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,760
check out this presentation and what I

366
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,399
said to this room in

367
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,339
2018. I said here's what I Envision I

368
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,920
Envision a future where hackers will not

369
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,720
hack if there is no Safe Harbor

370
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,300
I Envision a future where from four

371
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,760
programs with Safe Harbor one of them

372
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,220
the US government DOD by the way very

373
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,500
cool work work by Charlie by rural by

374
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,180
Katie I'm depending on many others

375
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,160
Leonard Bailey of course there is no

376
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,079
talk about cfaa about that doesn't

377
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,540
mention how much he was a great

378
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,279
inspiration in this field

379
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,180
I told them I imagine the future where

380
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,920
this was the standard

381
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,839
and I told this community I was a

382
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,560
student

383
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,079
I told this community this is up to us

384
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,060
the people in this room

385
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,579
you can make this work the community has

386
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,680
the power to changes today and you don't

387
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,500
need policy reform all you need is to

388
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,360
feel a little bit more inspired and

389
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,760
engaged to think about policy and what

390
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,600
it matters and then people like me like

391
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,120
others like Jack everybody here in the

392
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,079
room

393
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,959
to open up and share from the knowledge

394
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,660
and then we simplify access to this area

395
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,120
so this worked and I got the attention

396
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,579
of a few very great great hackers like

397
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:28,560
Casey like Jensen like Jack and they're

398
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,180
like oh you're not gonna hack until you

399
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,220
fix this and they were here in this room

400
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,500
and then I convinced the platforms fast

401
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,079
forward a couple of companies adopted

402
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,480
Safe Harbor this includes Elon Musk

403
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,860
that's how I met him and Defcon actually

404
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,959
got a challenge coin from him one of 30

405
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,420
or 40 in the world uh yolino yawning

406
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,160
Amon good friend from Tesla made that

407
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,160
happen not for hacking the Tesla but

408
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,800
this is a challenge coin I love it uh

409
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,259
but for fixing the program and guess

410
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,180
what they did something very cool

411
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,519
I think still one of the only maybe 10

412
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,160
in the world right now on this they

413
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,779
figured out the problem with hacking

414
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,540
Teslas is access to Teslas and that

415
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,559
people don't want to test their own

416
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,240
Tesla because there is a problem there

417
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,059
is a accident Academy Missouri's term

418
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:14,040
um

419
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,900
yeah you need to fix it and it's not

420
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,000
free because the hacking would buy a

421
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
valet guess what another contract the

422
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,980
warranty so they fixed that and if you

423
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,319
have a Tesla people you can absolutely

424
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,419
register as a pre-approved security

425
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,000
researcher on the website hacker Tesla

426
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,340
and if something happens they would fix

427
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,620
it for free this is the power of policy

428
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,640
and law

429
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,340
so a lot more uh

430
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,799
researchers now have access to test this

431
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,480
but here's where it gets really

432
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,740
interesting

433
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,360
Casey here

434
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,799
um took the challenge

435
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,500
and invited with all his prior work and

436
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,299
my work and others to co-found this

437
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:54,120
close IO and open source initiative

438
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,480
aimed to increase awareness to this

439
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,620
problem of contracts stifling research

440
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,299
because of interactions with

441
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,280
anti-hacking laws

442
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,559
and this was

443
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,320
I want to say 2017 just to give you this

444
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,900
is discloseio and I just want to inspire

445
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,480
you to think about the trajectory here

446
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,160
2018 16 sorry I start my research only

447
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,039
17 companies in the world with the bug

448
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,980
Bounty that says if you hack me I will

449
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,900
not pursue legal action in the bug

450
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,700
Bounty contract

451
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,700
2017 we start legal Safe Harbor as I

452
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,039
told you I had like four com four I had

453
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,840
to check it out on the talk I had four

454
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,120
companies when I came here to speak

455
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,940
we formed this close IO we start talk

456
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,679
about it we get the support of the

457
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,039
hackers

458
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,720
2018. how can one and background change

459
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,539
their default terms

460
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:53,280
thousands of companies using their

461
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,660
services including in the private bank

462
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,039
Bounty Market that we don't have access

463
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,020
to start to adopt your language

464
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,660
tens of thousands of hackers are more

465
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,480
protected because of that language this

466
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,419
is contract this is not cfaia reform yet

467
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,340
this is just a contract that is

468
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,740
applicable at scale think open source

469
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,020
license think creative comments for

470
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,179
thousands of thousands of hackers

471
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,340
2020

472
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,400
friends in sisa and DHS Cameron Jack

473
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
others decide it's a good practice it's

474
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,820
a public policy imperative to help the

475
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,679
hackers when they help us and provide

476
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,960
vulnerability reporting

477
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,600
they issue a binding operating directive

478
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,480
saying all federal agencies not only

479
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,039
will you have a vulnerability disclosure

480
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,740
program you will address or try to

481
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,200
address or mitigate the legal risks of

482
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,620
the hacker and provide a safe harbor

483
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,980
this is still 2020 we get Van Buren you

484
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,600
will hear about it from Hawley first

485
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,240
Supreme Court case on cfaa in 20 years

486
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,340
dealing with the issue of authorization

487
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,419
the entire security research Community

488
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:02,760
Auditors generalists everybody scraping

489
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,440
everything is at stake in the Supreme

490
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,700
Court

491
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,760
the Supreme Court gets free

492
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,340
opinions we call it the Mikus briefs

493
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,400
from third parties referring to this

494
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,660
problem

495
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,539
including one from disclosed IO with the

496
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,320
support

497
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,960
of hundreds of hackers

498
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,799
and tens and hundreds of companies

499
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,299
guess what

500
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,460
2021

501
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,460
the research this is by the way for me I

502
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,080
did some stuff in my life this is my

503
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,419
proudest moment the Supreme Court cites

504
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,960
this work in contracts when it makes the

505
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,299
decision we still have problems with Van

506
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,120
Buren but to narrow a little bit more

507
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,100
the interpretation of cfaa and

508
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,140
anti-hacking laws impacting all of us

509
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,960
here in the room remember 2016 this is

510
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,539
an academic paper this is four

511
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,100
provisions of contracts with four

512
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,580
companies this is the power of policy

513
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,740
2023

514
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,500
disclosure thank you Jack

515
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,340
is referred to in gen easterly director

speech and cardigan

520
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,240
2023 disclose they all

521
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,120
check that out secure by Design best

522
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,080
practices

523
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,760
all of your critical infrastructure

524
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,679
operators all of you manufacturers

525
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,360
current vulnerability disclosure

526
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,419
programs but with what with safe harbors

527
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,820
four researchers

528
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,940
what else we're going to see in 2023 I'm

529
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,039
going to make a prediction the EU cyber

530
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,020
resilience act if I have time and we'll

531
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,140
talk about it in my hopes in my dreams

532
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,840
all manufacturers selling products to

533
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,179
Europe not only having vulnerability

534
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,220
disclosure programs so hackers can know

535
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,640
where to report to issues but with legal

536
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,159
protections European Parliament coming

537
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,220
at you 2027 we'll see if I with your

538
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,860
support and hardly support make that

539
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,799
happen I hope so so this is a story on

540
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,720
how you are already a policy hacker

541
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,960
because guess what when I came here to

542
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,580
2018 2017 to Defcon to besides Las Vegas

543
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,799
to business San Francisco

544
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,620
when I spoke on this issue this

545
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,960
community has provided this room has

546
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,799
provided and I tell you no way this is

547
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,440
this would ever happen with us without

548
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,539
the support of anyone in this room

549
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,820
and the support of the community this is

550
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,640
the power of the crowd you too can

551
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,419
engage and should engage in this space

552
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,960
and world so let's hop in I already said

553
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,460
it's not legal advice

554
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,340
I'm gonna say a few words about

555
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,440
you know how this landscape is complex

556
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,539
and what is changing in it and then I'm

557
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,980
going to invite Harley

558
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,720
to tell you a little bit more about

559
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,760
anti-hacking laws white matters and how

560
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,900
you can engage

561
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,500
a little bit about security policy

562
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,320
again strap on fast fast ride here what

563
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,360
do we see in the environment

564
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,340
policy makers react to vulnerabilities

565
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,039
like Society every key vulnerability and

566
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,740
attack brings a way of neurologists

567
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,960
Cyber Law is perhaps the most complex

568
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,480
Dynamic impactful piece of domain

569
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,039
legislation in my opinion that we have

570
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,740
today the Mirai botnet how many of you

571
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,240
aware we are

572
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,280
we have a couple events

573
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,380
huge botnet

574
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,440
partially happened because of default

575
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,440
passwords right the bot taking the

576
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,120
devices not because the hacker wants to

577
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,880
Spire someone toasting or coffee making

578
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,659
right abilities but rather take all

579
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,820
these Bots into a major Network that

580
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,140
will cause a denial service attack

581
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,440
default passwords iot devices

582
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,799
that's a problem policy makers agree a

583
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,320
wave of iot security regulation

584
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,820
California

585
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:06,960
Singapore nist FTC Europe UK all of that

586
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,700
a lot of it inspired by Mirai

587
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,020
log 4J

588
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,320
open source security what do we get even

589
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,600
more traction to the concept of the

590
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,220
software bill of materials from the

591
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,500
executive order even more focused on the

592
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,539
important problems for open source

593
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:25,380
security

594
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,620
solo wins what do we get Colonial

595
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,100
pipeline ransomware payment we have now

596
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,620
a federal law on incident reporting and

597
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,659
ransomware payment reporting

598
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,880
they are all connected when we see

599
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,460
something in the Cyber attack versus

600
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,080
surface it impacts the way regulatory

601
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,700
thinks where they pay their attention

602
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,659
and how they hacked

603
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,020
okay

604
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,600
what are what am I talking about when I

605
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,460
talk about security policy security

606
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,799
policy is not your own company policy

607
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:59,460
but also this landscape of Regulation

608
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,640
standards contracts and code and design

609
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,179
it's a complex area but it's also an

610
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,159
inspiring area because remember this

611
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,500
closed IO disclosed IO is an initiative

612
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,880
that use contracts so policy is not just

613
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,159
laws and change can happen through code

614
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,100
and through contract

615
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,679
what are some of the key principles in

616
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:23,820
this space

617
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,740
there is one thing I know about hackers

618
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,240
and attack

619
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,640
right it varies it's not just lawyers

620
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,260
saying it depends hackers say that too

621
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,600
right because it depends on the stack it

622
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,220
depends on the environment sometimes the

623
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,460
OT physical sometimes it's a small iot

624
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,320
device or maybe it's the grid maybe it's

625
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,260
the cloud environments matter so we have

626
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,820
all these different segments and

627
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,740
business models and the software and the

628
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,720
SAS but we also have all this

629
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,380
jurisdiction it's a complex planet right

630
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,360
exactly like in our space kind of thing

631
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,980
where you have all these aliens but they

632
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,600
all come together to the Star Wars cafe

633
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,940
and somehow they all kind of understand

634
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,679
each other although all these aliens

635
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,179
right are coming from different nations

636
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:05,100
and different policy spaces and some are

637
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,720
doing standards instead of doing policy

638
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,820
and several hackers that's what's cool

639
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,760
about this planet which I hope you come

640
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,340
and join us too we have all these Global

641
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,140
interaction and we have this convergence

642
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,900
of security and Ai and privacy it just

643
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,700
means that when it comes to policy in

644
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,799
cyber we have a lot of principles we

645
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,600
think about leveraging standards and

646
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,279
Technical documentation

647
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,100
we think about flexibility and this idea

648
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,679
of design neutrality why if you put in

649
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,559
the law the concept of passwords guess

650
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,900
what I hope passwords become a thing of

651
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,179
the past maybe you should think about

652
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,059
using the term authentication cool

653
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,700
that's a little bit more future proof

654
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,980
all these different considerations is

655
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,140
what come in mind when me and my fellow

656
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,820
peers are speaking with regulators and

657
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,200
policy makers

658
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,120
I invite you to learn more about it and

659
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,279
check this out but without further Ado I

660
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,020
want to invite Harley Geiger good friend

661
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,840
inspiration mentor to take the stage and

662
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,700
invite you to participate in the hacking

663
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,640
policy console

664
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,720
[Applause]

665
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,140
hi thank you very much so hello besides

666
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,640
and thank you very much for inviting me

667
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,260
on here I really appreciate it so I'm

668
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,360
going to talk a little bit about hacking

669
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,279
law and policy sort of how it has

670
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,440
changed and how that is the result of

671
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,500
community action and before that though

672
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,260
like like me I'm a lawyer but this is

673
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,539
not legal advice please do not get me in

674
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,740
trouble with my Law Firm if you need

675
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,059
legal advice then you should get a

676
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:35,580
lawyer because they are really great

677
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,860
um so I'm going to talk a little bit

678
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,620
about the cfaa section 1201 and state

679
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,840
laws and how they've changed just in the

680
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,100
past few years some of the progress that

681
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,480
has been made and then some of the

682
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,159
challenges that are still left

683
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,000
uh so by now I'm sure that all of you

684
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,279
know the vast majority of our computer

685
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,679
crime laws were created in like 20 or 30

686
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,000
years ago and this has led to a chilling

687
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,039
effect because it gave a lot of

688
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,020
organizations companies government

689
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,299
agencies leverage over security

690
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:07,919
researchers to say that what they're

691
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,419
doing their security research or their

692
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:10,919
vulnerability disclosure is somehow

693
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,960
illegal and it gives them the power to

694
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,320
stop it the cfaa it was a big one right

695
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,880
so that is our nation's Premier

696
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,159
anti-hacking law and it restricts

697
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,720
accessing a computer without

698
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,240
authorization but obviously in the past

699
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,460
30 years what qualifies as authorization

700
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,740
has changed quite a bit it's become a

701
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,620
much bigger gray area and for a while a

702
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,900
lot of courts were were issuing opinions

703
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,400
that stated that if you were violating

704
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,799
terms of service that you were exceeding

705
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,419
your authorized access You've Lost Your

706
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:40,860
authorization and this is a federal

707
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,600
hacking crime but for security

708
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,100
researchers that's what they do all the

709
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,779
time right like they use computers in

710
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:47,940
unexpected ways to get unexpected

711
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,000
results and so cfaa in terms of service

712
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,880
violations being an anti-hacking crime

713
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,200
suddenly became a big problem for them

714
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,799
section 1201 that law says that you

715
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,080
cannot circumvent security safeguards to

716
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,120
software even for software that you

717
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,100
license yourself right so if you own a

718
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,659
device yourself and you have it there

719
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,400
you own the device perhaps but you're

720
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,200
only licensing the software and if

721
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,640
you're circumventing software security

722
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,679
safeguards without the authorization of

723
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,779
the software manufacturer and who gets

724
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:17,159
who gets the authorization from the

725
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:18,600
software manufacturer first if you're

726
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,000
doing it independent right then you have

727
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,820
violated section 1201 and although the

728
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,559
cfaa gets a great deal of attention

729
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,779
probably most of you are from some State

730
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,760
here in the United States every state

731
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,399
has its own version of the cfaa the CFA

732
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,899
is not a preemptive law it's a federal

733
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,580
law but each state has its own computer

734
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,279
crime law and most of those laws are

735
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,779
actually more broad than the Computer

736
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,880
Fraud and Abuse Act believe it or not if

737
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,320
you'll look it up you'll see it's the

738
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,700
same sort of verbiage but they also

739
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,500
include other Provisions or they take

740
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,240
away other require environments that

741
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,059
make them in fact more Broad

742
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:52,080
but

743
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,000
in the past seven years and I'd say

744
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,960
especially in the past three years

745
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,159
there's been a tremendous amount of

746
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,720
progress you've heard a great deal of it

747
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,520
from a meet here already right but so

748
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,460
section 1201 now has a pretty robust

749
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,159
security researcher exception for it it

750
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,380
covers a lot of security research the

751
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,539
cfaa there was the Van Buren decision

752
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,279
that is the Supreme Court decision and

753
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,899
the Supreme Court rather definitively

754
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,240
answered a lot of the the terms of

755
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,220
service question stating that if you

756
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,899
have authorization to access a computer

757
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,059
for one purpose like personal or

758
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,279
employment use then if you are using it

759
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,080
for another purpose that is perhaps not

760
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,779
authorized this is not a CFA violation

761
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:31,440
so that personal or employer computer if

762
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,460
you're authorized for it for that

763
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,799
independent security research is not by

764
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,980
itself going to be a CFA violation in

765
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,480
addition right after that Van Buren

766
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,100
decision the Department of Justice

767
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,260
issued a charging policy change saying

768
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,940
that their prosecutors would decline to

769
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,200
prosecute good faith security

770
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,240
researchers and it was based on the

771
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,580
section 1201 exemption the state of

772
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,399
Washington actually had as an exception

773
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:55,500
for white hat hacking is a carve out

774
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,960
from their computer crime law and then

775
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,840
some nations are following suit Belgium

776
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,360
recently issued a Safe Harbor from its

777
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,799
Nationwide computer crime law for

778
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,899
security researchers and then globally

779
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,880
we're seeing a lot more adoption of

780
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,500
coordinated vulnerability disclosure and

781
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,419
vulnerability disclosure policies which

782
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,600
will help a great deal by avoiding

783
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,500
misunderstandings and conflicts between

784
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,299
researchers and the organizations that

785
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:19,919
they are disclosing their

786
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,960
vulnerabilities to how did we get here

787
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,640
how did all this happen it's like like

788
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,559
Amit said communicate the the community

789
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,779
has been absolutely key this has not

790
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:29,760
been by a single driving force there's

791
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,740
no single single lobbyist or single

792
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,179
organization or single security

793
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:35,100
researcher that has made all of this

794
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,720
happen it has been Community engagement

795
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,460
from the ground up it has been

796
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,620
organizations in the nonprofit sector

797
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,659
government officials who are friendly

798
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:44,279
and motivated and passionate about this

799
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,500
a lot of Industry figures a lot of

800
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,220
academics and I think most importantly

801
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,740
countless decentralized in individual

802
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,419
interactions between the community and

803
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,640
policy makers that's how it happens this

804
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,820
is very much a ground up sort of effort

805
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,960
but there's still a lot to do

806
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,059
I expect you to read all of this

807
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,500
uh

808
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,600
so this this is just a the charging

809
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,399
policy so the charging policy that the

810
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,200
doj had issued what it says essentially

811
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,700
is that an attorney for the government

812
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,340
so a prosecutor should decline to

813
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,640
prosecute a uh somebody who is acting a

814
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,679
performing good face security research

815
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,059
and they Define good face security

816
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:26,399
research so you are doing it for good

817
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,020
faith testing investigation or

818
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,000
correction of a security flaw in order

819
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,940
to strengthen the security for uh for

820
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,740
users or for the class of machines that

821
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,419
you're working on and you're not doing

822
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:38,159
it in a way that can cause harm to the

823
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,679
public but there's limitations it's not

824
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:41,760
going to protect you if you're doing

825
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,620
something like extortion right so it's

826
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,940
just for good faith security research

827
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,039
there's a glimpse of the researcher

828
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,080
exception under dmca it's virtually the

829
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,940
same thing this has become the sort of

830
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,200
the definition of good faith security

831
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,779
research that we're seeing kind of uh

832
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,539
percolate throughout the law right now

833
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,179
um same thing if you're accessing the

834
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:01,919
computer for purposes of investigating

835
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,720
and correcting a security flaw and doing

836
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,120
it for just that purpose you know and

837
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,980
you're you're doing it uh in a way

838
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,159
that's going to avoid harm to the public

839
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,620
there's Washington you can see there in

840
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,960
the in the highlighted portion

841
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,760
um that is your white hat security

842
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,340
research exemption uh in the state of

843
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,899
Washington for their computer crime law

844
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:24,539
so a lot of progress and these things

845
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,640
are are meaningful it's not often that a

846
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,039
class of professionals like this gets

847
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,440
carve outs from the law specifically for

848
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,000
them and it shows the power of that

849
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,620
Community engagement some of the things

850
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,419
that still need to happen though greater

851
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:37,679
adoption of coordinated vulnerability

852
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,360
disclosure I mean it's still a minority

853
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,919
of organizations that have vulnerability

854
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,919
disclosure policies the Cyber resilience

855
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,440
act so this is this is a proposed law in

856
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,820
Europe it's going to be huge you're

857
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,720
going to we're going to be talking about

858
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,580
it the way that we talk about gdpr right

859
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,440
now but it'll take a while to get

860
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,760
through but one of the provisions of

861
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,460
that law states that you must if you

862
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,500
have a x a vulnerability that is

863
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,419
exploited without authorization which

864
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,159
again is that funny concept which

865
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,539
includes good face security research

866
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:04,380
right if you're doing it without

867
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,600
authorization that exploit or that

868
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,219
vulnerability must be disclosed to

869
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:09,960
European government agencies within 24

870
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,839
hours to 24 hours it is not likely to be

871
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,179
mitigated so you're imagine this is and

872
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,500
this applies to all software in Europe

873
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,199
so imagine a rolling list of software

874
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,399
packages with unmitigated

875
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,260
vulnerabilities that will make

876
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,119
vulnerability disclosure a lot less

877
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,339
welcome right if you're disclosing it to

878
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:27,780
it to an organization and they have to

879
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,339
go through all that

880
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:32,040
uh state anti-hacking laws I mentioned

881
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,199
so the state of Washington wonderful

882
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,418
that they have a an exemption however

883
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:37,859
that's the only state that I know of

884
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,659
that does right so there are tons of

885
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,040
other states out there with very brought

886
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,899
into hacking laws they have not evolved

887
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,119
the way that the CFA has there's no Van

888
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,800
Buren for the states there's no charging

889
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,780
policy like the doj did that was just

890
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,780
for the CFA does not apply to the states

891
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,239
uh State uh dmca so there's that

892
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,980
researcher exception it protects the act

893
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,820
of research but it does not protect

894
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,460
making your your tools public so this

895
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,900
actually applies to all penetration

896
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,359
testing services believe it or not as

897
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,099
well as making your exploits public the

898
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,660
dmca actually prohibits this and we're

899
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,980
all just kind of whistling past this

900
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,780
regulation but it's there and there is

901
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,040
no security exception there's no

902
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,020
possibility of a secure a security

903
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,520
exception for it without an act of

904
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,040
Congress and then ofax sanctions we

905
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,599
don't believe that vulner receiving a

906
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,460
vulnerability disclosure from an ofax

907
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,320
sanctioned entity ought to be an OPAC

908
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,640
violation

909
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,920
and to address some of these issues

910
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,740
we made the hacking policy Council uh

911
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,900
thanks

912
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,820
um so the hacking policy council is a

913
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,800
group of companies uh that have gotten

914
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,960
together to make a more favorable legal

915
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,000
policy and business environment for

916
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,220
vulnerability disclosure good faith

917
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,780
security research penetration testing

918
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,720
vulnerability management right now those

919
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,820
the group of companies is Google Intel

920
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,460
bug crowd hacker one integrity and

921
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,440
lewdest security and together we're

922
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,820
working on the issues that I just

923
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,220
discussed so the Cyber resilience act

924
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,380
there's that article again don't expect

925
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,520
you to read it but feel free to take a

926
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,380
picture it says article 11. if you have

927
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,940
contacts with European government I

928
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,560
suggest that you reach out to them this

929
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,599
is a terrible policy we think that this

930
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,640
raises intelligence concerns it's going

931
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,160
to require vulnerability sort of

932
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,200
disclose to perhaps dozens upwards of 50

933
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,000
government agencies each time

934
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,380
ofac right so as we increase security

935
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,520
cvd throughout the world it's going to

936
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,079
result in more vulnerability disclosures

937
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,420
to more organizations and we don't think

938
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,339
that that should be disrupted that is a

939
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:33,660
good thing for the community we want

940
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,280
organizations to get their vulnerability

941
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,740
disclosures we don't want sanctions to

942
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,000
be one of those things that gets in the

943
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,920
way we have an export regulator or an

944
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,480
export exception for it we need one for

945
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,859
ofac now

946
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,599
and then

947
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,000
just an example of a state law that is

948
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,280
in dire need of some reform this is

949
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,660
Maryland uh home of the NSA and if you

950
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,599
even attempt to identify a valid access

951
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,720
code if you if you even attempt to

952
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,280
identify a hard-coded password in an iot

953
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,859
device or a default password in in

954
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,900
Products that come out like a friend of

955
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,579
mine he built the defaultinator right

956
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,740
then apparently in Maryland this is this

957
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,579
is not this is not legal very outdated

958
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,800
and then despite all that even even if

959
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,119
we get through those things and despite

960
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,500
the progress that we have still made

961
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,880
right there are still going to be

962
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,920
instances where security researchers are

963
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,780
facing legal threats for good faith

964
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,359
security research so the hacking policy

965
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,820
council is taking on policy advocacy the

966
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,320
security research legal defense fund is

967
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,640
supposed to help take on the Judiciary

968
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,339
in a way right so this is a this is a

969
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,740
defense fund that will be able to

970
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,660
provide financial assistance to security

971
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,060
researchers that face legal threats for

972
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,099
good faith security research like that

973
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,960
like the doj charging policy it's not

974
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,400
interested in protecting you if you are

975
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,800
engaging in something like extortion but

976
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,020
for a lot of hackers that receive sort

977
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,760
of bogus threats and cease and desist

978
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,440
letters the security research legal

979
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,359
defense fund can help you pay for your

980
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,119
lawyer to combat that

981
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,339
so this is my last slide then I'll turn

982
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:03,839
it back over to you and me going forward

983
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,480
right there's still a lot to do I don't

984
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,800
want people to think that because we

985
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,240
have made tremendous progress as a

986
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,680
community that we can that that's the

987
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,599
high water mark and now we will just

988
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,700
kind of take it easy I don't think that

989
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,520
we can right so as as cyber security

990
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,800
laws ramp up in many different sectors

991
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,660
and throughout the world these same

992
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,000
issues are still going to be there

993
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,359
um I would encourage you to focus not

994
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,579
just on federal but also State local

995
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,320
International right a lot of the federal

996
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,240
law gets most of most of the uh most of

997
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,400
the attention but your your States it

998
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,200
would be a great place to make your

999
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,240
voice heard and that will be the key to

1000
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,740
continued progress is community

1001
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,359
engagement and making your voice heard

1002
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,040
hopefully one of the things that these

1003
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,140
presentations have taught you is that it

1004
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,480
works policy advocacy does work but it

1005
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,700
works best when the entire Community is

1006
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,380
engaged and the entire Community shows

1007
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,060
that it's a priority all right thank you

1008
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,720

1009
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,920
thank you I have my up can we make this

1010
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,420

00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,119
yes okay cool

1012
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,300

the good news

1014
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,300
and the bad news I'm still talking uh

1015
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,680
the bad news we won't have time for

1016
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,140
questions uh but I'm gonna stay around

1017
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,180
um so thank you Harley and the Venable

1018
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,740
disclaimers

1019
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:23,099
um I'm gonna fast forward uh this this

1020
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,680
issue on product security all I'll tell

1021
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,880
you is this

1022
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,640
remember what gdpr lead to privacy and

1023
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,560
compliance remember how we all talked

1024
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,820
about it

1025
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,180
the EU cyber resilience Act

1026
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,940
in progress is the most comprehensive

1027
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,859
holistic

1028
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:43,680
complex regulation and it's going to

1029
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,440
apply to all products coming into Europe

1030
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,820
this is very important so try to engage

1031
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,640
but in the beginning of this talk

1032
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,599
I told you that I'm living Intel and

1033
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,579
you're probably asking yourself

1034
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:01,440
why or maybe you're not asking maybe

1035
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,720
it's pretty clear but Intel has been

1036
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,400
amazing to me and taught me a lot and in

1037
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,780
the last four years I've been handling

1038
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,940
the cyber security policy and today I

1039
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,380
had the cyber security policy at Intel

1040
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,420
and I also chair a couple of committees

1041
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,060
like the ITI committee and the open

1042
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,920
source security Foundation committee all

1043
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,380
these trade associations and with these

1044
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,540
trade associations the coalitions we

1045
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,940
have done a lot but you just heard from

1046
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,060
Harley that we are asking you to engage

1047
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,420
but how and where not just in

1048
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,520
conferences not just here in the room

1049
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,800
how are you going to be really truly

1050
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,680
empowered to engage how are we going

1051
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,339
from a number of companies and trusted

1052
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:44,220
members of the communities and advocates

1053
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,500
and all these people here that want to

1054
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,599
make that change into reality

1055
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,780
well that's my next big thing open

1056
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,940
policy we are still a little bit in

1057
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,619
stealth but you are getting a preview

1058
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,540
right here hopefully the video is not

1059
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,220
going up soon

1060
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,180
my goal is to democratize policy and

1061
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,060
truly engage with all entities from all

1062
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,839
sizes seed startups hackers individuals

1063
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,000
unicource

1064
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,060
with policy makers to get educated

1065
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,619
to understand

1066
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:21,180
to make this important relaying of cyber

1067
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,180
policy and Beyond open to more and more

1068
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,900
and more parties that want to engage and

1069
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,780
impact that change but we all know for

1070
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,660
True openness we need technology

1071
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,700
so hopefully

1072
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,760
but I've used I'm going to attempt to

1073
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,160
disrupt lobbying and I'm not doing it

1074
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,339
alone but I'm pretty excited open policy

1075
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,079
is going to be access to policy powered

1076
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,260
by Tech keep it a secret

1077
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,720
yet uh we are a little bit in stealth

1078
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,839
but that's my next big thing so stay

1079
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,720
tuned May 1st

1080
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,980
[Applause]
