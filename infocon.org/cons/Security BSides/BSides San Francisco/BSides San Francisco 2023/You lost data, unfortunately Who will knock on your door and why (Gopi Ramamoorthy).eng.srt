with you what you need to know before we

32
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,280
get into the topic and then I'll take

33
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,780
you through the Journey there's a

34
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,579
five-day course but I'm trying to give

35
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,839
you in 50 minutes

36
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,880
a little bit about me I've been in the

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,659
industry for 15 years uh handle Security

38
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,640
in fintech for 10 years close to 10

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,100
years and in healthcare for five years

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,340
and after all the practice I'm building

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,799
up data security product at symmetry

42
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,860
systems

43
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,899
disclaimer I am a cyber Security

44
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:03,299
Professionals with more certifications I

45
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,700
am not a lawyer the second important

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,380
thing is I'm going to refer multiple

47
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,520
laws here regulations here the moment I

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,360
prepared this slide and then uh down the

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,819
line when you refer this the laws or

50
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,340
regulations might have changed so please

51
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,500
check what is current

52
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,360
and the third important thing is I

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,940
looked at uh I rev I read a lot of books

54
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,060
I looked at websites and my sincere

55
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,900
thanks to all of them foreign

56
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,660
first of all we need to know why this is

57
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,220
important right you're going to spend 50

58
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,400
minutes and you need to have some data

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,980
points to convince yourself why this

60
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,119
topic is important

61
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,640
so I'm listing a list of a set of

62
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,400
organizations here you might have used

63
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
them you might be a customer for them

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,940
and they all have a decent size security

65
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,840
teams and they also go through multiple

66
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,120
complaints certifications each year

67
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,760
starting with sock 2 PCI ISO and more

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,180
industry specific certifications so

69
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,400
somebody come from third party come and

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,819
verify them they have Basics compliance

71
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,519
hygiene they have security requirements

72
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,700
to meet to get the certifications

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,760
but unfortunately they also had gone

74
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,700
through data breaches so this is one

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,140
data point

76
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,720
the second data point is this particular

77
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,720
company surf shark has been collecting

78
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,260
data breeds data

79
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,540
data since 2004.

80
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,220
and the number you see is 16 billion

81
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,519
data records have been breached so this

82
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,000
is only pii this not even counting PCI

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,799
PMI

84
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,500
uh Phi RCM mccui not other data so what

85
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,879
it means is

86
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,480
we always have a risk

87
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,220
it doesn't matter how the company how

88
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,159
big company is there is always inherent

89
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,579
risk of losing data and it could be a

90
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,620
organization mistake it may not be

91
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,079
organization mistake sometime new

92
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,720
technology comes in it comes with a set

93
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,880
of vulnerabilities before it gets

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,820
stabilized

95
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,800
so irrespective of multiple security

96
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,220
layers we build irrespective we spend

97
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,340
money on having security teams

98
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,780
irrespective we go through compliance

99
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,960
still there is a risk for data so what

100
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,100
it means is to all offices we need to be

101
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,100
prepared

102
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,560
okay this slide has a star so please pay

103
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,720
attention

104
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,880
before you understand the section three

105
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,040
four five six whatever I'm going to

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,820
bring it up I'll start with you you need

107
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,160
to know what data you have do you have

108
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
obviously most of the organizations have

109
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,740
pii then do you have Health Data do you

110
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,240
have phpci data do you have any DOD cmmc

111
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,060
data do you have any stop secret data so

112
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,460
you need to know all different data

113
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,620
types you need to have then your brain

114
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,520
will help you to see how you prepare for

115
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,220
data breach there may not be data fridge

116
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,039
fortunately but you need to be prepared

117
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,020
so on the on the

118
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,320
the left uh one you already know the

119
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,500
middle uh section Data Systems

120
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,960
previously we used to have data only in

121
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,039
databases rdbms but with last 12 years

122
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,340
data Data Systems how data have been in

123
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,060
flat files data have been in different

124
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,300
types of cloud cloud storage and data in

125
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,900
in different vendors the cloud vendors

126
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,080
and also uh when we try to understand

127
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,539
how to be prepared for data breeds we

128
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,740
need to know

129
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,680
data residency you need to know where

130
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,680
your data is you need to know which

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,419
reason you are storing

132
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,400
and there is a there is a good paper

133
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,220
from

134
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,180
u.sitcommerce.com gov it talks about

135
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,180
the data centers and NATO governed NATO

136
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,240
countries and data centers in oecd

137
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,060
countries so these two put together have

138
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,080
some level of protection for your data

139
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,020
so the NATO countries and oecd countries

140
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,220
put together

141
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,500
how only

142
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,560
three fourth of the data centers fall in

143
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,960
those countries and one-fourth of the

144
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,840
data centers in the globe fall outside

145
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,300
of these countries so you don't even

146
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,840
have a legal way to something happens

147
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,380
you don't even have a legal way to

148
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,380
follow up on those data centers so see

149
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,800
not only the AWS region not only the

150
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,280
provider make sure those regions are in

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,860
the countries you want to have some

152
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,800
political power like NATO or oecd

153
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,919
know your data systems so again I'm just

154
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:31,500
preparing you so once you find data what

155
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,460
data you have please understand who has

156
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,500
access to your systems what kind of

157
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,080
monitoring your company your security

158
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,080
team your technology team have put in

159
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,199
the data systems uh there have been

160
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,539
multiple different new technologies

161
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,560
coming in including one data Centric uh

162
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,440
the technology dspm data security

163
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,319
posture management this is a new one but

164
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,240
please understand where your data is

165
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,000
what data who has access and what

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,419
monitoring your company tech tech Force

167
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,800
have put it in

168
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,699
okay now you know the data next we need

169
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,520
to know if there is some incident who

170
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,860
are the stakeholders

171
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,940
in the in the game so so unfortunately

172
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,120
there is a say data Bridge right who

173
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,720
could sue the organization again I'm I

174
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,300
try to make easy for you to I put it in

175
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,940
the three categories right first the

176
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,940
leftmost customers and individuals there

177
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,880
are direct customers who are

178
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,539
paying you and you're serving them

179
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,940
second there are indirect customers like

180
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,480
a data subject like UK facts collect

181
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,720
data about you and me but we are not

182
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,480
directly paying in like unless we use

183
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,240
their service but they collect data

184
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,860
about you and me there are indirect

185
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,120
subjects

186
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,600
third is employees and fourth categories

187
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,720
the private law firms filing class

188
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,260
action lawsuits on behalf of victims it

189
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,360
could be data subject it could be a

190
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,399
customer but anyone so these four

191
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,760
categories fall in the leftmost second

192
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,720
one is private institutions so anyone in

193
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,060
the supply chain

194
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,820
serving part of the service right so

195
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,459
before 10 12 years there were less

196
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:32,580
number of players in the supply chain

197
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,240
but with all the digital transformation

198
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,000
to make one one transaction to go

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,440
through whether it's a money moving

200
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,060
transaction or a credit card transaction

201
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,940
or even you're buying the retail

202
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,480
um things from Macy's or Target

203
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,399
transaction there are multiple players

204
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,980
involved you will see some interesting

205
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,120
data I'll provide so those players could

206
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,220
be

207
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,200
if they are impacted they could sue the

208
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,779
organization where data breeds occurred

209
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,000
and the third important category is a

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,620
big elephant in the room the government

211
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,820
who could be sued so I'll start with the

212
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,080
first one

213
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,040
so anyone providing I.T security or

214
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,740
cyber security service providers for

215
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,580
example at the bottom line if you see in

216
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,640
2013 when dark Target had a data breach

217
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,580
their PCI service

218
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,240
PCA auditor got included in the lawsuit

219
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,040
as well by Banks

220
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,760
second in 2020 when Marriott had data

221
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,160
breeds their I.T service provider

222
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,860
Accenture was included in the lawsuit

223
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,500
so it's be aware of the players in the

224
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,640
game

225
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,279
the second category is supply chain we

226
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,680
already talked about I already talked

227
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,480
about little here

228
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,140
the acquiring Banks Payment Processing

229
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,140
vendors all those starting from the

230
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,959
network to end to make the payment all

231
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,399
the supply chain

232
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,880
can get sued as well by the players

233
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,720
within the supply chain for example when

234
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,240
something happened at Home Depot the

235
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,640
banks suing

236
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,300
some of the players in the supply chain

237
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,760
same thing uh the insurance companies

238
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,720
some of the insurance companies in the

239
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,480
data breeds they showed

240
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,800
um and the organization and and

241
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,519
organization suit the or insurance

242
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,940
companies back to get the payments so

243
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,279
the lawsuit could not only one way it

244
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,660
could go back and forth based on the

245
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,440
the classes within the insurance uh the

246
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,660
policy so for example if you look at BEC

247
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,540
business email compromise so some of the

248
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,899
insurance policies Have Not Included the

249
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,000
coverage for Bec

250
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,079
many of them now include fishing many of

251
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,700
the insurance policies include

252
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,579
ransomware protection but not all of

253
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,519
them include business email compromise

254
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,820
attack and coverage so when your company

255
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,140
buys

256
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,360
insurance policy please pay attention

257
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,880
otherwise you end up spending time here

258
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,399
going back and forth between you already

259
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,640
have a bad day and then you already you

260
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,959
have to deal with this as well

261
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,740
where could so so this is also important

262
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,820
uh the reason it's important is

263
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,380
first understand the court system right

264
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,779
at the federal level we have Supreme

265
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,139
Court and then you have 12 appeals or

266
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,420
circuit court so if you look at the map

267
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,300
there are 1 through 11 and then they

268
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,980
fall in 94 districts then 11 plus DC so

269
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,000
12

270
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,120
circuit courts and please be unders

271
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,820
aware that not every Circuit Court

272
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,860
interprets the law

273
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,579
correctly not correctly

274
00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:22,740
consistently that's a correct word so

275
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,220
some are lenient some are not lenient

276
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,800
and also you need to see the history

277
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,740
behind that circuit court before that

278
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,200
you you decide to file or somebody

279
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,720
decide to file a lawsuit within the

280
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,240
Circuit Court also it depends on

281
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,579
jurisdiction you may have an option to

282
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,860
select Circuit Court you may not have an

283
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,620
option to select circuit code based on

284
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,240
the jurisdiction

285
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,839
so

286
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,740
okay now we saw the players next let's

287
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,779
see what are the regulations

288
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:01,139
so there are 10 different laws that

289
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,899
directly or indirectly connected to data

290
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,360
breeds start with a data breach

291
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,920
notification law

292
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,980
as of last year or so there were 48

293
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,560
states but this year I mean as of 21

294
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,980
there were 48 states but as of 22 all

295
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,300
for all 50 states plus DC have data

296
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,880
breach notification law

297
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,820
and the second set category is cyber

298
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,220
security protection laws so cyber

299
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,320
security there are 10 plus states have

300
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,519
specific cyber security laws

301
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,000
the ucl's few states have false claim

302
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,459
acts also few states have I have some

303
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,100
samples but we can you can go and

304
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,240
complete later

305
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,779
there are privacy laws there are at

306
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,300
state level there are six privacy laws

307
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,720
so

308
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,220
Colorado California

309
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,779
Iowa Virginia and Utah so there are six

310
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,480
privacy state level laws active as of

311
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,420
today and Indiana is almost approved and

312
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,060
it will go live in either this year or

313
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,480
next year

314
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,820
then there are federal sectoral privacy

315
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,360
laws around 40 of them I have the slide

316
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,560
in coming uh in the appendix but what I

317
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,440
mean is sectoral losses you have health

318
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,920
care specific loss like HIPAA and Gina

319
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,740
calgina uh

320
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,920
21 cure act then

321
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,160
um there are educational laws then

322
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,620
there's a financial

323
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,720
specific loss there are total 40

324
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,959
different regulations in the FED level

325
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,839
then there are consumer protection laws

326
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,459
then

327
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,560
udap udab is a very important one I'll

328
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,060
go through that one

329
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,760
and on the right side what you see is

330
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,180
they are consumer protection and

331
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,699
Anti-Trust loss but they are not

332
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,620
directly data breeds but they have been

333
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,980
heavily heavily used in case of data

334
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,920
Bridge lawsuits

335
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,800
what are the repeated costs of

336
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,519
uh causal cited in lawsuit so in the

337
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,320
previous slide we understood there are

338
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,040
10 different laws regulations could be

339
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,940
used to file lawsuit in case of data

340
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,980
breach in this slide what you are trying

341
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,980
to understand is out of all the lawsuits

342
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,019
out of all the regulations what we talk

343
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,019
about what are the repeated causes used

344
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,420
again and again and again

345
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,899
to go after the companies by the

346
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,600
government by the by the private parties

347
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,279
by the customers by the supply chain

348
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,600
so

349
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,660
first and foremost violation of its own

350
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,720
policy and promise so you have a running

351
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,480
a company and your security policy your

352
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,679
like my company.com slash security

353
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,760
policy says we protect customer data we

354
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,980
take your customer we take customer data

355
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,260
seriously we protect we have a lengthy

356
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,260
lengthy statement please read it and

357
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,480
then make sure you follow it for your

358
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,000
cyber security professional please take

359
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,280
it seriously and follow it if you are a

360
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,319
legal professional please review your

361
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,839
own publicly posted policy and review it

362
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,940
because that was the repeated

363
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,760
mentioned in the lawsuit again and again

364
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,179
the second one is lack of fundamental

365
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:42,419
cyber security the third one is lack of

366
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,720
reasonable security for example

367
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,880
Equifax collecting all the sensitive

368
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,480
data they need to have a little higher

369
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,900
level of cyber security hygiene compared

370
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,299
to some other company

371
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,760
collecting a public data like LinkedIn

372
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,120
profile we all post our own public data

373
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,500
but uq facts TransUnion have higher

374
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,600
sensitive data so those companies should

375
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,879
have higher level of protection

376
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,660
Okay so

377
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,760
on the right side what you see is the

378
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,440
financial institutions have brought

379
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,080
multiple lawsuits against the retail

380
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,960
companies or other companies that have

381
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,260
went through data breach and and not

382
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,380
have a

383
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,299
reasonable protection and these are the

384
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:41,299
causes I found in multiple lawsuits

385
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,820
Last by category uh regulation by

386
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,419
category so I try to put little bit more

387
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,000
details connecting to the previous uh

388
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,900
two slides back so this one is data

389
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,700
breach notification law

390
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,640
uh we I talked about States how all

391
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,220
states have database notification law

392
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,299
federal government has four direct data

393
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,580
breach notification law

394
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,640
other other regulations are not directly

395
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,320
related to data bridge but we will go

396
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,020
through that wet Federal has four direct

397
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,400
related to data breeds loss and the

398
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,460
middle section you see is cyber security

399
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,700
and data protection regulations these

400
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,039
are some examples I have listed this is

401
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,100
not comprehensive for example at the

402
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,220
bottom of the uh slide I've listed

403
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,460
Florida one New York one

404
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,120
a New Hampshire one and Ohio one but

405
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,860
this is not comprehensive I have given

406
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,679
this for examples

407
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,260
biometric data Protection Law there are

408
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,240
four States including New York has

409
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,740
biometric data protection loss so

410
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,980
I I can add it in the uh the appendix

411
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,039
but understand that there's another

412
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,559
category we need to worry about if

413
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,440
somebody collecting a biometric data

414
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,419
from the customers

415
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,559
the right column here you see is

416
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,020
FTC act FTC Act is very important one

417
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,539
and we'll go through I have one slide

418
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:21,140
for that one

419
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,340
okay so Federal

420
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,000
Trade Commission act this is one of the

421
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,640
highly highly repeatedly used

422
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,140
uh article the section five uh in

423
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,140
multiple cases in most of the big data

424
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,700
breach uh cases Section 5 was used to go

425
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,799
after the companies where data breach

426
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,000
occurred so Section 5 talks about it

427
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,120
prohibits unfair or deceptive Acts or

428
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,440
practices in that affecting the Commerce

429
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,160
so this is multiple time highly used

430
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,620
against the uh in data Bridge lawsuits

431
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,600
the remaining section Section 8 13 and

432
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,780
19. so these come up when

433
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,380
the the company uh they do not agree on

434
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,700
Section Five

435
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,780
FTC has ways to go after those companies

436
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,559
using Section 8 13 and 19. and

437
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,320
understand FTC rule was created in 19

438
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,240
1914

439
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,820
and it's continuously updated number one

440
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,299
number two from FTC there have been

441
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,539
multiple child organizations connected

442
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:47,280
to FTC like cff BBB and few more even

443
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,740
though there are multiple Federal

444
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,280
entities have been created still FTC has

445
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,380
a higher authority to go after these

446
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,400
data breach companies

447
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,059
standing to sue so whenever there's a

448
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,820
lawsuit in this we need to understand

449
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,380
whether the victim has a standing to sue

450
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,780
the organization

451
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,020
and it's coded in article 3 section 2 of

452
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,880
U.S Constitution

453
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,520
so what is standing right so whether

454
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,520
victim has a legal

455
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,020
case to go after the organization

456
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,240
they always look at the code always look

457
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,140
at three things standing causation and

458
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,039
harm

459
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,419
so

460
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,380
harm some of the courts understood or

461
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,480
interpret us what has been caused so far

462
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,940
what how much money the victim spent

463
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,419
how much time the victim spent

464
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:53,820
but some of the appeals court also

465
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,700
looked at the harm that would be cause

466
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,940
in future if you look at this

467
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,140
um

468
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,580
uh I think uphill got three looked at

469
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,700
the future harm and approved some of the

470
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,620
legal

471
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,500
cases against the organizations

472
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,780
so you need to understand how different

473
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,179
appeal courts worked based on the

474
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,419
history they may

475
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:25,340
interpret the regulations differently

476
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:30,600
okay this does the data another data

477
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,240
point how much uh so some data is lost

478
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,860
and how much is being sold in the uh

479
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,460
dark web this data is from Experian and

480
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,720
the range would you see some ranges vary

481
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,159
from confirmed user identity to not so

482
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,280
confirmed user identity

483
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,100
okay this is one of the recent important

484
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,000
role from Caesar to govern and and

485
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,440
making sure the 19 sectors 19 critical

486
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,740
sectors in the U.S report any cyber

487
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,500
security incident to see sir that

488
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,620
includes data breach as well

489
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,960
yeah

490
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,700
how to report where to report what's the

491
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,940
timeline this is the uh slide so 72

492
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,980
hours you need to report

493
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,700
the rule and the rule making is still in

494
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,559
progress the rule making could take

495
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,799
anywhere from 18 months to 42 months but

496
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:35,280
Cesar already has given a template to

497
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,740
report and she's a and also the

498
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,100
organization could share

499
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,039
um what what could be said with other

500
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,780
companies so they have an option to

501
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,500
indicate that

502
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,140
I talked about a direct

503
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,960
data breach rules from the FED these are

504
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,840
the four the others are all indirect

505
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,480
these are the four direct data breeds

506
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,220
related

507
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,100
um regulations

508
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,919
1996 and 2009 they both are related to

509
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,260
healthcare one and 1999 the glba came in

510
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:20,580
and 2022 it just us talk about circia

511
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:24,360
on the international side uh everybody

512
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,880
knows gdpr that's uh that's a big one

513
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,480
and article 33 and 34 talk about data

514
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,279
bridge and what to do

515
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:35,159
um I have one slide for that one

516
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,760
so as part of any uh data breach

517
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,480
um some organizations and need to know

518
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,659
how to how prepared data breach

519
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,360
um notification plan

520
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,380
so the basic template should include all

521
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,279
these uh definitions and we need to

522
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,380
understand what these definitions are

523
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,140
because these are the definitions

524
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,039
repeatedly mentioned from 50 different

525
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,720
states

526
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,760
data breach notification laws and some

527
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,220
of the international one so I'm going to

528
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,140
go through some of these sample

529
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,980
definitions in coming slides

530
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,500
they the middle

531
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,600
portion of this slide talks about what

532
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,419
is the notification timeline

533
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:27,059
notification requirements and some of

534
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,360
the interesting thing I found is some

535
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,340
state government requires multiple

536
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,559
notifications not only

537
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,840
when the data breeds occurred and you

538
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,960
found it's also when the customers

539
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,840
notified and then they have few other

540
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,059
Milestones it's not one time

541
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,340
notifications so please be aware that

542
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,100
there are multiple milestone in

543
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,139
notification to some of the states

544
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:57,000
another thing uh interesting that I

545
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,960
found is if there is a thousand records

546
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,240
or more or thousand individuals are more

547
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,260
impacted the states have the Mandate for

548
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,240
the organizations to notify credit

549
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,260
reporting agencies so that the victims

550
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,500
don't have to if there's a huge level of

551
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,380
data breeds because the organization

552
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,559
should reach should report credit

553
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,700
reporting agencies

554
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,140
stands for breeds notification rules uh

555
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm listening we'll go through a few

556
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,659
sample definitions to understand uh the

557
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,500
the listing I made here and they have

558
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,320
some differences but that's why I put

559
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,580
some samples

560
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,520
first one every state have defined

561
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,460
almost most of the states and the

562
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,039
international organizations have defined

563
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,400
or what do they mean by personal data

564
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,279
and some states just talk about the

565
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,559
first name last name address some State

566
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,200
some states or International bodies talk

567
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,159
about

568
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,740
financial and health care and some

569
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,840
International countries they talk about

570
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,080
the religion and the labor union and

571
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,900
political parties you are connected with

572
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,179
so it depends

573
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,900
um but the high level just understand uh

574
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,360
based on your jurisdiction what you are

575
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,940
collecting what you need to know and

576
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,299
what the law applicable to

577
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:36,260
second one is a preemption of compliance

578
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,500
this I read from few States so what it

579
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,400
means is the company already following

580
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,220
certain federal level regulations

581
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,100
related to data breach then it means

582
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,919
they are already they are meeting some

583
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,740
of the state level requirements so for

584
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,480
example uh the DC looking a company if

585
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,260
they're already following a high-tech

586
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,980
glba requirements then the state assumes

587
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,100
that the organization have met some of

588
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,600
the data breach requirements

589
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,200
preemption of complaints from California

590
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,940
if California are just looking at high

591
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,799
tech and HIPAA while the DC looked at

592
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,760
the glba as well

593
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,600
security breach definition so I I read

594
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,940
some of the states uh they were very

595
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,080
simple like data from the stored systems

596
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,960
last it's a security breach but some of

597
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,059
the states have gone through a long

598
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,840
definition uh this one from Connecticut

599
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,039
if you read this

600
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:54,080
electronic files media database

601
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,299
computerized data so they go through

602
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:59,220
multiple medium because with the

603
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,360
technology

604
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,179
the data could be in multiple places so

605
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:06,000
some of the states have defined data

606
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,760
Bridge definition in length

607
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,419
risk harm analysis so if some of the

608
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,899
states have defined if there's no risk

609
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,140
caused by

610
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,559
this point kind of data breach then

611
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:30,539
the uh they they have some lenient in

612
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,220
the notification and other process

613
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,020
okay this is the security breach

614
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,480
definition from

615
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,299
cfr4144 I mean CFR 45

616
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:42,860
um

617
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,820
anhipa

618
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,120
and the important thing here is HIPAA

619
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,340
gives you

620
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,220
a class that if risk assessment has been

621
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,760
done and risk assessment concludes there

622
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,799
is no harm

623
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,179
then

624
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:01,620
there is

625
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,679
um the BNR

626
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,659
requirement is not

627
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,720
um it's it's not fall under disclosure

628
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,120
or breach

629
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,200
okay

630
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,320
so now let's look at one sample uh

631
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,059
International one gdpr article 33 and 34

632
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,279
right 33

633
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,520
um is defining what the requirement of

634
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,799
data breach notification is and it it

635
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,779
tells the the

636
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:33,600
within 72 hours this needs to be

637
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,120
reported

638
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,360
and for the data processor it needs to

639
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,299
be immediately they need to notify to

640
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,580
the data controller

641
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,520
okay so in next five slides I am going

642
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,679
to give you the tables you can build on

643
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,799
I have created the template and it takes

644
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,279
uh I have books in the in the credits

645
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:00,240
and it takes 30 minutes or 20 minutes to

646
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,220
build each table I'm giving you a

647
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,500
template you can go and build on and

648
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,559
Please be aware this table may change

649
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,200
the next year and next year and so on

650
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,480
so first one I am looking at a bridge

651
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,100
notification timeline so this table

652
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,000
um

653
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,820
I put together from immediately to 60

654
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,179
days and you can fill I fill some of

655
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,480
them you can fill uh remaining based on

656
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,640
your jurisdiction and what data you have

657
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,260
all those things

658
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,020
this is the substitute notice

659
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,980
so this table is very interesting one

660
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,460
so some say a data breach occurred and

661
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,059
the the organization have said 200 000

662
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:46,919
customers

663
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,440
trying to connect them may be possible

664
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,380
may not be possible or may be very

665
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,260
expensive so what government have

666
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,020
defined governments have defined as if

667
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,059
it's going to cost more than certain

668
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:01,860
amount of dollars

669
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,740
you can have substitute notice what it

670
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,679
means is you can go and display the

671
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,039
notice on your website number one or you

672
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,919
can contact your local state media

673
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,360
and you can put a notice that this

674
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,779
happened so you don't have to reach all

675
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,940
the customers number one you may not

676
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,760
even have the address of the customers

677
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,340
customers made a mood so this is where

678
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,419
substitute substitute notice comes

679
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:36,120
so there are alternate ways for the

680
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,919
organizations to reach out to customers

681
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,539
number of individuals uh interestingly

682
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:48,000
HIPAA Hippa is 500 records right between

683
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,620
this and this slide

684
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,019
but many states I have read they have

685
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:57,059
the 250 records or person limit if there

686
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:59,399
is a violation or data Breeze occurred

687
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:02,820
for 250 records or more

688
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,820
then the the state data breach

689
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,639
notification rule kicks in so please be

690
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,918
aware it's not always 500 it's not

691
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:14,699
always 1000 it's many states have 250 so

692
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,540
please be aware

693
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:21,060
okay I talked about this one reporting

694
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,239
to Consumer reporting agencies so some

695
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,820
states require the organization to

696
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,839
report to the UK facts TransUnion

697
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,119
Experian and any consumer reporting

698
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,760
agencies if there is a certain threshold

699
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,040
crossed

700
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,159
ransomware reporting

701
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,639
I included this slide because many of

702
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,399
the time when ransomware happens and

703
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:48,960
eventually

704
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,619
uh I mean uh the data Breeze also occur

705
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:56,040
right the Bad actors trying to get your

706
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,960
data uh

707
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,020
many of the time throw ransomware so I

708
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,200
included this information in the slide

709
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,920
and if any ransomware occurs the

710
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,280
organization have a legal man legal uh

711
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,680
requirement to report to a FBI

712
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,619
our top secret service number one number

713
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,320
two the government does not encourage

714
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,900
the organization to make payment for

715
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,839
ransomware but for some reason the

716
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,540
organization make the payment they need

717
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,540
to report to devotee sisa

718
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,839
so please be aware of that

719
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:40,020
okay now we learned about the systems

720
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,500
the players the regulations and some of

721
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,099
the cases now we need to have a template

722
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:51,480
to have a plan right so I looked at the

723
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,940
web and went through this

724
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,560
FTC has a very good template and also at

725
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,720
International level the Australian

726
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,260
information security comes in our office

727
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:08,339
has a good template uh make look at them

728
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:11,099
and see how he can make use of it how

729
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:14,520
you can customize to your own company

730
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,540
okay

731
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,400
this is uh

732
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,160
Let's uh learn I mean let's look at some

733
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,740
samples what happened and we can learn

734
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,220
from them

735
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,740
okay so this slide lasting more than 20

736
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,020
companies I mean there's a long list but

737
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,760
uh I put picked up uh the major ones and

738
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,280
the the middle portion of the slide

739
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,660
tells which government bodies went after

740
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,300
these companies on the right side what

741
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,820
you see is what regulations are laws

742
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,760
used in the lawsuits against these

743
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,420
companies first let's start with uh

744
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,880
okay before we go to your sample I'm

745
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,099
just reminding what are the repeated

746
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:02,700
causes we learned in section three so

747
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,160
these were the repeated causes used

748
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,460
again and again in multiple lawsuits now

749
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,700
let's jump onto a sample

750
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,540
we'll start with Equifax right so

751
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:19,380
Equifax uh they didn't patch the Apache

752
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,079
stretched on time and because of that

753
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,579
they went through

754
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,619
air data breach

755
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,220
and there were 390 plus civil lawsuits

756
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,339
and companies spent more than 700

757
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:35,280
million dollars and two plus years of

758
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,040
distraction company faced

759
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,839
now

760
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,000
the outcomes

761
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,900
um

762
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,540
I mean before out comes there were

763
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:50,940
multiple lawsuits by the government as

764
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,060
well as the uh the individual data

765
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,240
subject like the class action lawsuits

766
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,780
the outcomes if you look at this one uh

767
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,579
the last one I would start with this is

768
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:05,880
where it the company failed

769
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,140
uh patch management was weak and so the

770
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,380
the lawsuit uh asked

771
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,960
the the outcome of the lawsuit is to

772
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,839
reorganize the patch management team the

773
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:22,500
second one is conduct risk based pen

774
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,800
test so if the organization having

775
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
multiple

776
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,740
exposed publicly exposed end points and

777
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,800
the data is connected to them do the

778
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,040
risk based pen test so that's an

779
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,339
important one and

780
00:38:40,339 --> 00:38:44,240
interestingly with California settlement

781
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,640
with Equifax sorry Equifax settling with

782
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,820
California California mandated apply

783
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,460
zero trust principles wherever possible

784
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,000
that's an interesting one from the zero

785
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,740
trust perspective

786
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,619
and the one you see in the red minimize

787
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:03,240
data collection

788
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,640
I'm not sure how Equifax or credit

789
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,940
reporting agencies trying to implement

790
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,700
that they are they're all collecting as

791
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,980
much data as possible but that was

792
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,099
written in the outcome of the lawsuit

793
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,440
settlement

794
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,079
next one I'll go through Uber so Uber

795
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,960
went through a data breach

796
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,300
the bad actor was paid

797
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,960
and it was not disclosed and after

798
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,599
certain change in the leadership and

799
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,900
management after one year Uber disclosed

800
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,400
the data breach

801
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,339
and immediately all the 50 states jumped

802
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:45,119
on to file the lawsuit and the outcome

803
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,380
is

804
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,960
the the problem was there was a weak

805
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,220
password

806
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,160
from the third party can get to the data

807
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,160
so outcome is what you see on the on the

808
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,160
on the right side they asked to have

809
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,859
strong password and encrypt personal

810
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:03,200
information

811
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,540
wherever it's required and the important

812
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:10,560
technically if we are technical

813
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,520
um the lawsuit outcome included

814
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,740
incorporate privacy by Design that's a

815
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,560
good thing about this so

816
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:25,500
next one target data Bridge so this

817
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,579
happened in 2013 so HVAC

818
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:34,320
um HVAC third party uh user had admin

819
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,440
access control from there it got misused

820
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,500
and the bad actor had a multiple lateral

821
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,740
navigation to get to the POs to plant a

822
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,660
script to collect the data from the

823
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,119
memory so this high level technical

824
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,440
right now coming to the data breach

825
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,579
incident there were 92 claims

826
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:58,500
multiple 92

827
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,940
class action lawsuits and

828
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,099
and the company went through like four

829
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,560
years of distraction it even caused the

830
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,020
job for CEO

831
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,619
and the outcomes uh is

832
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:15,980
how monitor

833
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,020
risk-based auditing of vendor so that's

834
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,359
the important one so you have multiple

835
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,260
vendors but based on the vendors and

836
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,599
what access they have we need to have

837
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,960
risk based auditing and monitoring

838
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,599
so in terms of Zoom

839
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,980
they were climbing they were

840
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,220
encrypting all the meetings data

841
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,440
from what you and me talked over the

842
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,020
last three years but actually they were

843
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,859
not so FTC found out and they went after

844
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:56,359
Zoom to file a lawsuit

845
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,880
okay so far we saw we learned some

846
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,060
samples we learned the regulations now

847
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,099
the takeaways

848
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:08,220
so at the end of the day we need to have

849
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,200
we need to know the systems we need to

850
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,520
have appropriate

851
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,820
Security based on the data we collect

852
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:21,599
based on the risk the data we collect

853
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,599
and please understand who is the data

854
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,000
controller who is the data processor the

855
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,160
whole ecosystem

856
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,020
the second one is understand the

857
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,680
regulations and jurisdictions so

858
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,619
where your data is what type of data you

859
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,000
have and how and what regulations they

860
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,079
fall under understand them and create a

861
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,220
data breach incident response and

862
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,780
notification plan

863
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,740
and I would recommend everything is now

864
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,900
automation right everything is highly

865
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,660
becoming Technical and their data is

866
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,079
exploding so please try to see how it

867
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,839
can be automated how the Technologies

868
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,380
you already paying can be put to use to

869
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,140
bring more visibility into the data

870
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,760
management

871
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,619
the

872
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:19,079
the the the

873
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:21,180
um the technology keeps changing

874
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,520
application security host security

875
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,579
network security everything can be done

876
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:27,960
but

877
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,740
but data needs to be focused important

878
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,260
because data security start with data

879
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,240
security because all the thing

880
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,060
application broken or data host broken

881
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,339
or network broken they all going to go

882
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:44,339
after your data so start with data

883
00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:47,040
security first and then go towards other

884
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,279
one

885
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,319
these are the websites uh I I looked at

886
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,180
a long list of websites on books but

887
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,259
this is at high level

888
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,160
I like to show

889
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,280
um this one

890
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,400
so this is very very uh interesting one

891
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,500
so many of you work through code of

892
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,319
federal regulations so this U.S

893
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:15,660
government have put together 50 titles

894
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,440
and each title has its own important and

895
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,440
understand these I highlighted some of

896
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,560
them you may come across when you try to

897
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,260
do a cyber security or data protection

898
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,040
or complaints and understand take a look

899
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,920
at these regulations and see how it's

900
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,160
relevant to your job it's a very useful

901
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,359
one

902
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,960
for example title 45 years HIPAA and

903
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,560
title 21 is about FDA any clinical

904
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,980
trials any Tylenol or cancer or covet

905
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,260
medicine testing have to follow the

906
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,220
regulations under title 21

907
00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:00,420
the banking cost 12 and the devotee all

908
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,140
those are 48 and um

909
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,920
48 that's one more 32. so try to

910
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,260
understand I mean look at this map help

911
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,140
your brain to capture this and then your

912
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,240
brain will help to correlate things for

913
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,980
you

914
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,500
the appeal courts I talked about these

915
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,359
are the 12 and there are 94 uh

916
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,119
districts within the 12

917
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,760
these are the 40 plus sectoral loss I

918
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,319
talked and this not directly related to

919
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,560
data breach notification but having

920
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,460
having a little bit understanding of

921
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,220
this would help to uh

922
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,460
fill the fill the puzzles in your in

923
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,380
your

924
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:51,359
plan so for example say you are

925
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,300
collecting Finance data or you're a

926
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,920
public company you have a socks

927
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,119
complaints each year you need to do so

928
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:02,880
you need to you need to have some level

929
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,460
of knowledge into what Financial

930
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,500
regulations are

931
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,560
and online privacy so if your company

932
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,880
having

933
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,560
online gaming or online services company

934
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,460
you need to understand few of the um

935
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,800
uh the online privacy regulations

936
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,420
thank you everyone

937
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,599
