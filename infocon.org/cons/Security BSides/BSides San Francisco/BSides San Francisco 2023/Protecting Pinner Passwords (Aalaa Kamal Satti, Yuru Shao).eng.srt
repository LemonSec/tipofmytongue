1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
hello everyone thank you for being here

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,480
today just to let you know that there

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,460
will be no slido today but we will be

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,300
hosting a live q a after and thank you

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,860
guys take it away

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,660
all right hi everyone Thanks for

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,160
attending

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,740
um so the topic for today is protecting

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,840
printer passwords or more directly

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,260
protecting Pinterest user passwords

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,800
um a little bit about us my name is

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,660
I'm a software engineer on Pinterest

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,880
product security team

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,098
my name is Joe Rochelle I'm also on the

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,960
production security team working on a

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,300
product Security in my spare time I

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,940
enjoy pinning cats on Pinterest so a

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,739
little bit about product security team

19
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,420
and Pinterest so we are part of the

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,300
circuit in fact our colleagues from our

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,520
civilian team cup security they have

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,440
another presentation this afternoon so

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,820
if you're interested go check that out

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,280
as well

25
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,840
and the production team we do the

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,239
typical application security themes and

27
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,039
we also do account security which is

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,680
what we are talking about today

29
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,260
and we also do secure hdlc body

30
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,020
detection prevention security Frameworks

31
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,540
security libraries fantastic and we also

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,740
run our backbending program

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,720
so on the agenda for today we'll go into

34
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,460
the background we'll talk about all

35
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,380
things passwords and why they can be

36
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,840
problematic then we'll jump in to

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,119
discuss how we at Pinterest identify

38
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,400
users with problematic passwords

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,960
specifically those with compromised

40
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,060
credentials and then which of those

41
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,700
users qualifies high-risk users we'll

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,680
then go into the user protections and

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,340
then finally our learns and insights

44
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,479
so to start off with the background

45
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,759
we're just going to go over some of the

46
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,759
a few of the big problems with passwords

47
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,640
in general and then delve into some of

48
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,979
the bigger problems with passwords at

49
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,600
Pinterest

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,299
um and so to start off the problems with

51
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,280
passwords one of them is that they tend

52
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,619
to be predictable people tend to choose

53
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,479
passwords that are easy to remember and

54
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,060
that are familiar to them last year's

55
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,860
most commonly used password according to

56
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,619
nordpass was the word password followed

57
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,899
by one two three four five six which

58
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,819
probably corresponds to the minimum

59
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,620
password length requirement for most

60
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,060
sites

61
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,620
um so as you can see looking at this top

62
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,300
10 list when it comes to password

63
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,200
creation creativity is not a priority

64
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,860
um

65
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,020
moving forward another problem with

66
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,180
passwords is they're attempting to reuse

67
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,360
so if you consider that the average U.S

68
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,480
adult has somewhere between 90 to 120

69
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,120
different online accounts uh it's safe

70
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
to assume no one's creating unique

71
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,500
passwords for all of those accounts

72
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,319
um and in factsecurity.org did a a

73
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,000
survey and they found that anywhere

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,760
between 70 to 75 percent of users will

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,260
reuse passwords across multiple accounts

76
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,599
moving forward another problem with

77
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,300
passwords is that they are shared and

78
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,819
can be easily socially engineered this

79
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,680
is especially true when it comes to

80
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,540
streaming sites or sites where you can

81
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,319
have multiple user profiles per account

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,720
and also those that employ weak security

83
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,060
questions as a means for account

84
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,659
recovery

85
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,760
and then finally one of the other bigger

86
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,500
problems I wanted to touch on is that

87
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,239
passwords can be exposed via data

88
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:22,920
breaches which have been steadily on the

89
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,319
rise over the years

90
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,040
um for uh the the real issue I mean it

91
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,599
doesn't really matter how secure your

92
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,760
password is this is always a possibility

93
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,580
but the issue comes from reusing

94
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,680
passwords across multiple accounts if

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,900
one of if that password is exposed via

96
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,459
data breeds and all of the accounts

97
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,560
using that same password are vulnerable

98
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,640
and so uh this is the problem that we

99
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,640
are trying to solve at Pinterest it's

100
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,319
the main problem that we're focusing on

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,720
and that is users that are reusing

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,720
compromise credentials

103
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,659
and so in that regard the problem with

104
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,360
passwords at Pinterest is that one we're

105
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,140
subject to frequent ATO attempts and

106
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,220
um and having as many users as we do the

107
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,659
number of users that are reusing

108
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,540
compromise credentials are is it's not

109
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,399
insignificant and so you might think

110
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,560
okay well why don't you just invalidate

111
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,120
their passwords and force a password

112
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,220
reset well we have a few things to

113
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,919
consider one is that the user experience

114
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,259
at Pinterest we really value the a

115
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,960
positive user experience doing something

116
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
like that would be a poor experience for

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,639
the user it'll also impact engagement we

118
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,440
want users to be able to engage on

119
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,540
Pinterest and if we raise the the

120
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,940
frictions to returning it that would

121
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,240
limit that and then another big issue is

122
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,520
we don't require email confirmation on

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,740
sign up and so that means that there are

124
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,139
users that are signing up on Pinterest

125
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,780
with uh email addresses that they don't

126
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,820
actually own so if we force the password

127
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,220
reset they will never get that email and

128
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,900
they won't be able to get back into

129
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,419
their account and so what that means for

130
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,060
us is that we need to not only be clever

131
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,220
but incredibly patient when it comes to

132
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,220
improving our security posture

133
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,380
um and so how do we do that that's the

134
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,020
question that we want to answer here

135
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,139
and so uh the first part of that answer

136
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:22,380
we have to determine well how many users

137
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,780
and which of our users are actually

138
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,699
logging in with compromise credentials

139
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,500
and so we have two main detection

140
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,780
methods um one of them is called

141
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,539
penripper so pin Ripper is an internal

142
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,419
tool that we use to identify pinners

143
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,220
with the credentials based on

144
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,979
third-party data breach records and the

145
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,780
way that it works is that it ingests two

146
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,300
types of Records one is a Pinterest user

147
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,699
DB dump and that's going to include all

148
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,919
of our users user IDs emails and

149
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,320
Associated password decrypts and then

150
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,000
the other type of record is the third

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,560
party data breach record and that's

152
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,360
going to include email addresses and

153
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
Associated plain text passwords that

154
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,820
were exposed and so the trick is because

155
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,800
the data breach record may or may not

156
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,259
include Pinterest users we need to

157
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,380
identify which ones are and so the first

158
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,539
part is identify or checking for email

159
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,419
matches between both records once that

160
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,940
is made then the Big Crypt is computed

161
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,740
from the plain text password from the

162
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,900
database record and compared to our

163
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,740
users decrypt on file and if there's a

164
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,020
match then we've identified a Pinterest

165
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,600
user reusing compromise credentials and

166
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,580
at that point we flag them for

167
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,659
Downstream processing

168
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
the other method that we have is the

169
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,860
recaptcha password check and this is

170
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,840
based on Google's database of 4 billion

171
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,759
leak credentials and the way that it

172
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,100
works it's much simpler we just make an

173
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,440
API request with the canonicalized form

174
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,860
of the user email or username and then

175
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,380
assaulted hashed of the user password

176
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,240
and

177
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,860
um so once you make that request you get

178
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,720
an API response that looks like a little

179
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,020
bit like what you see on screen

180
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,580
and the key that we're interested in is

181
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,919
the credentials leaked and simple true

182
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,840
false and if it is true we do the same

183
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,539
thing with pin Ripper and we flag that

184
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,419
user for Downstream processing the thing

185
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,160
that I really want to impress upon you

186
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,560
is that the uh

187
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,259
pin Ripper and Ray capsu's password

188
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,240
check are meant to complement one

189
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,580
another with pin Ripper we're able to

190
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,280
cover all of our users whether they're

191
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,500
active or inactive with the password

192
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,419
check we're only able to cover users

193
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,759
that are active and necessarily on one

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,060
of four password flows but the benefit

195
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,979
with the password check is that we can

196
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,840
Leverage The user's engagement to

197
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,520
protect their account which is not

198
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,500
something that we can do with penripper

199
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,060
which works asynchronously

200
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,220
so now we have a look at the pin report

201
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,919
internal tool and the password track and

202
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,539
next I'm gonna talk about how we

203
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,240
integrate them to our systems and how we

204
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,000
actually use them as signal provider and

205
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,400
how we provide a single Tower Downstream

206
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,039
service services so our product security

207
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,160
team in this work we are like the

208
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,319
service provider we ingest the signals

209
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,500
we ingest data from

210
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,300
data sources and we do some processing

211
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,360
and then we must find a way to provide

212
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,520
that signal internally to our customers

213
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,258
to our partner teams

214
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,560
um sorry so here comes the hru or high

215
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
research user

216
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,299
um we create a definition of hybrid user

217
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,240
and we put it as an account level flag

218
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,399
so user accounts are considered high

219
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,620
risk if they meet the following

220
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,500
conditions uh we try to four conditions

221
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,660
first of course the count should have

222
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,399
the credential detected using the

223
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,519
signals a second condition is that the

224
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,820
password uh has not changed after the

225
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,700
detection of the credentials because we

226
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,580
have offline processing and our math and

227
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,580
average users is 400 million but our

228
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,260
total number of users in convenient

229
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,839
those inactive ones is a huge number of

230
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,760
users and the procession takes some time

231
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,700
so we must check the timestamp and make

232
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,120
sure before we were able to forget the

233
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,279
user they have not checked they have not

234
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,100
changed their password yet and and we

235
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,160
also believe that mifa especially we use

236
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,200
SMS

237
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,040
is sufficient enough to prevent ATO and

238
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,380
users if they have MFA enabled we don't

239
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,260
have to call them high risk

240
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,980
um and we also provide the secondary

241
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,580
logging methods in addition to uh you

242
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,380
email and password unlocking we support

243
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,200
like social media logins and if you if

244
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
users do not actually use password

245
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,580
logging frequently or actively then we

246
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,200
believe they're not at high risk

247
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,540
um then with this definition and with

248
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,600
the signal sources we build uh two

249
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,839
approaches from labeling users uh so we

250
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,540
have the offline process with the pin

251
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,880
Reaper internal tool which fetches and

252
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,339
process of my data set then we use a

253
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,560
synchronized job to update our user DB

254
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,560
uh this again this this allows us to

255
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,080
scan our our users inconvenient those

256
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,120
interactive ones or inconvenient those

257
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,580
are not uh actually frequently with

258
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,940
Pinterest with a real-time approach we

259
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,100
are able to intercept some user flows

260
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,140
and integrate the password track so

261
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,660
again the benefits of real-time track

262
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,880
that we can integrate this with user

263
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,620
engagement with users interfaces

264
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,560
um here is a high-level architecture of

265
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,620
the offline and online approach

266
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,200
um again we have data sets from of

267
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,000
compromise credentials and I will have

268
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,300
our user DB dump we run some matches and

269
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,079
we produce the data to uh I3 bucket then

270
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,899
we use the pink which we use penetr

271
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,180
which is our internal

272
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,040
um asynchronized job scrambling service

273
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,860
so this those synchronized jobs will

274
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,019
pick up the data and write the data to

275
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,519
our user DB

276
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,579
and in real time we have integrated we

277
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,019
have integrated with capture track to

278
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,899
recover password track to the major user

279
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,779
from those regarding authentication and

280
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,540
we will update the user DB from the

281
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,199
real-time track

282
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,120
um so with Jacksonville kind of the hru

283
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,600
original definition so we learned some

284
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,899
lessons from recent ATL campaigns and we

285
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,180
realized that uh some high-res users

286
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,459
they didn't figure any protections and

287
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,860
they are not they have liquid

288
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,959
credentials but we somehow didn't detect

289
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,019
them as high risk then we look at our

290
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,720
definition and we realize okay the four

291
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,660
conditions are pretty strict and we need

292
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,060
somehow expand the definition to cover

293
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,660
more users I think one reason is that we

294
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,760
use isms based imfa and that's not uh as

295
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,519
good as like Fido or key security

296
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,240
business and user can can be still be

297
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,420
user can can still be taken over by like

298
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,420
a Sim swab attacks

299
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,680
and also for

300
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,019
um user with social media unlocking some

301
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,700
of them they still have password on

302
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,279
their profile uh we just believe like

303
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,519
when they send up uh with Google email

304
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,160
they do not actually set a password but

305
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,100
we that's a true first assumption some

306
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,959
of them will come back and then set a

307
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,279
password on their account and those

308
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:47,519
passwords can be uh operated in a

309
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,180
different website

310
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
so moving on to user protection so we

311
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
talked about which users are considered

312
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,720
high risk so now we have specific

313
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,420
protections for those users

314
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,180
um and so before delving into what those

315
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,279
protections look like I want to start

316
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,720
off by talking about the two different

317
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,579
classes of protection so we have

318
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,380
engagement protections which happen

319
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,019
after the point we identify users with

320
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,240
compromise credentials but before

321
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,940
suspected ATO attempt and the

322
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,100
programmatic protections happen at the

323
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,220
point of when we suspect an ATO attack

324
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,800
and so the main difference is one and

325
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,320
engagement protections we believe that

326
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,899
the the user that is online is the

327
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,720
authentic owner and then in the

328
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,579
programmatic protections we don't

329
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,620
and so I'm going to start there um so

330
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,240
account takeover protections take place

331
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,339
when we detect suspicious activity on

332
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,500
the account so we have an internal rule

333
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,779
that's specific to users with compromise

334
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,899
credentials so a few of the um the main

335
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,120
points of it is that they must be a high

336
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,980
risk user and they must be logging in

337
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,019
from an unknown browser and a new IP

338
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,839
address and at that point

339
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,660
um we invalidate their password we log

340
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,639
them out of all of their uh we log them

341
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,260
out of their active sessions and we

342
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,540
invalidate those sessions as well

343
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,399
and so they'll get an email that looks

344
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,920
like this and essentially if they want

345
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,899
to get back and recover their account

346
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,220
they would have to go through the

347
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,079
password reset flow or click on this

348
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,040
link on the email

349
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,579
and so that contrasts with the

350
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,019
engagement protections like I mentioned

351
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,820
before these are going to be for our

352
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,760
users that we believe all actually truly

353
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,220
on the account and also mentioned before

354
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,320
with the recaptive password check we can

355
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,060
Leverage The user's engagement to be

356
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,100
able to protect their account and so one

357
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,100
of the ways that we do this is on

358
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,320
password change and reset every time the

359
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,560
user attempts to change or reset their

360
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,079
password we check against the API to

361
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,639
determine if that password had been

362
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,760
leaked and if so we we block it

363
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,120
yeah

364
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,699
other forms of Engagement protections uh

365
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,380
so we have the this concept of

366
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,899
experiences at Pinterest and essentially

367
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,500
a user a high-risk user whenever they

368
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,260
land on the home feed depending on what

369
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,779
platform they are on they'll see one of

370
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,680
one of these modals or Nags on the left

371
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,440
is what they'll see on web where we

372
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440
encourage the password change and also a

373
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,660
connection to either Facebook or Google

374
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,320
on the right hand side are our mobile

375
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,560
experiences for Android and iOS

376
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,060
um and the difference between the two

377
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,940
the reason why we're able to promote the

378
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,980
social connections on web is mostly

379
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,779
because of the availability of surface

380
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,220
area

381
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,000
um

382
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,360
and if they were to connect to Google or

383
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,839
Facebook uh we they'll see these nags

384
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,139
and basically they'll will erase their

385
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,600
password and we let them know that their

386
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
password will no longer be valid and so

387
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,620
if they want to start using a password

388
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,540
again to access their account they would

389
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,100
have to go through the password reset

390
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,459
flow

391
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,440
and so this is kind of what the

392
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,260
engagement protections look like

393
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,779
um or the trends and yellow are the

394
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,940
password protections and blue are the

395
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,420
Google protections and green or Facebook

396
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,380
um

397
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,880
so you see there are a couple of main

398
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,220
spikes that I want to touch on here the

399
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,040
first one is the integration of new

400
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,899
signals

401
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:27,300
um so the more signals that we we

402
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,920
receive the more users that were

403
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,380
flagging is high risk and the more that

404
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,320
they're going to see those modals on web

405
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,040
or iOS or Android and uh update their

406
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,660
passwords or connect to Google or

407
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,779
Facebook and the second Spike here

408
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,300
you're gonna see that this is when we

409
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,480
started to revamp all of our modals on

410
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,600
the different possible on the different

411
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,180
flows and so

412
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,579
um the engagement is going up

413
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,100
and then in this last one this is uh in

414
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,839
reference to what you was discussing

415
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,880
previously about the expanded definition

416
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,280
we expanded the definitions so more

417
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,679
users are classified as high risk and

418
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,540
that means more users are seeing those

419
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,339
engagement protections and updating

420
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,619
passwords or connecting to other social

421
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:14,939
accounts

422
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,160
um I do want I do want to touch on here

423
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,079
that the overall trend is that it's

424
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,419
going down with more users that are

425
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:23,579
being classified as high risk then the

426
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,319
more they're protecting the accounts the

427
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,599
fewer users that are seeing this over

428
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,760
time and that's the trend that we want

429
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,980
to see

430
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,500
yeah I want to add something here just a

431
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,240
one small piece about engagement

432
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,460
protection we built so actually in

433
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,559
modern browsers like Chrome and Safari

434
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,539
is supposed a thing called a wellness

435
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,220
well-known slash change password

436
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,220
redirect so the way it works that they

437
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,020
have some builty

438
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,380
um password managers and like Google

439
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,140
like Chrome and Safari they store they

440
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,140
can store your password and the manager

441
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,020
the password for you they also have some

442
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,059
capabilities for detecting Bridge

443
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,460
password or password resources across

444
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,919
different websites and they oftentimes

445
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,799
give you some alerts seeing okay we have

446
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,440
detected Bridge the password or you are

447
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,059
reducing your password on different side

448
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:18,660
uh do you want to proceed and and change

449
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,480
your password or to update the password

450
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,520
they would just grab the well-known

451
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,980
selection password of the set and read

452
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,100
their user to there so again as we have

453
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,380
talked about engagement protections we

454
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,960
want to navigate user engagement and we

455
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,840
want to make it I we want to make it as

456
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,539
actionable as users so when users

457
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,580
connect the button we should give them

458
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,220
the red page and allow them to take the

459
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,240
right actions immediately

460
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,960
so next I'm gonna talk about the

461
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,880
Learners and insights so so far we have

462
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,400
talked about the internal tools and the

463
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,059
password track uh which we we use as to

464
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,980
ingest the signals we talk about how we

465
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,700
enable hru AKA hybrid users in our

466
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,980
system so that that they can be EOS by

467
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,980
our Downstream and partner teams and we

468
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,600
also look at the engagement protection

469
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,240
and the program protections which

470
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,840
actually provide a proactive way for us

471
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,059
to prevent atos from happening

472
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,179
um so in terms of the overall kind of

473
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,039
security there are some low high and

474
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,840
fruits you should consider first apply

475
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,460
different kind of security requirements

476
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,320
for different users

477
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,260
um this is uh especially true for

478
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,960
Pinterest because we have two main

479
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,720
categories of users one category is the

480
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,000
personal users and second category is

481
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,940
business users and basically those

482
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,000
advertisers who have a different portal

483
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,520
who are ping

484
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,860
add content on Pinterest

485
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,980
um you'll probably hit that but those

486
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,520
are our valuable business users uh so we

487
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,679
actually have different requirements for

488
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,140
the kind of security for example for

489
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,559
personal users MFA is optional you can

490
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,200
have my imfa enabled but you are not

491
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,080
required for business users we actually

492
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,900
provide some products so business owners

493
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,480
they can require they can really

494
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,760
mandatory for the employees to to turn

495
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,520
on MFA otherwise the business user will

496
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,880
lose the asset to the account

497
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,419
so I think for our peer companies you

498
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:34,860
probably should consider doing the same

499
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,500
thing and it's not that difficult and

500
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,679
written limiting is a small thing you

501
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,780
can quickly build but it's actually very

502
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,400
helpful for preventing Blue Frost

503
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,280
attacks you can set a user-based return

504
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,940
limiting and IP basic limiting and you

505
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,620
can have more advanced reading limit

506
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,360
team but actually at least you should

507
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,539
have some part there and supporting

508
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,820
well-known expression password redirect

509
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,740
is a such a small change you can do

510
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,919
within 20-50 minutes but from other

511
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:07,100
experiences we saw immediate

512
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,179
increasing our traffic to the password

513
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,500
change page again we talk about the

514
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,080
protections and those protections will

515
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,179
prevent atos from happening because you

516
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,160
actually ask users or you actually

517
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,520
protect the users prefer the successful

518
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,740
logging attempts

519
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,660
so you should also consider some

520
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,120
proactive measures for detecting

521
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,200
Precision support higher users

522
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,559
I do want to come out some limitation of

523
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:40,200
about the engagement protections again

524
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,960
this is great for user experiences and

525
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,460
for preventing eto's add-on early stage

526
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,440
but the coverage really depends on two

527
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,200
things it really depends on user

528
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,200
engagement and this limited for two

529
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,559
reasons uh one reason is that uh users

530
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,039
that do not come back to Pinterest

531
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,720
they may never be protected by

532
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,460
engagement protection because they will

533
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,820
just now see uh the experiences we ship

534
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,000
and also we have some users a certain

535
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,700
number of users on unsupported clients

536
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,980
is this is especially an issue for

537
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,039
mobile because a web we will get the

538
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,080
most recent build immediately but on

539
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,240
mobile they have to upgrade their apps

540
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,159
on their phone so there are certain

541
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,980
users we can not receive the experiences

542
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,840
because they're just on the answer

543
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,980
political convergence

544
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,520
um so we also marry the effectiveness

545
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,539
and from the 2020 to ATU campaigns we

546
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:46,380
found that 90 percent have impacted ATO

547
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,600
impacted accounts they actually usually

548
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,580
credentials and we actually have detect

549
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,960
them uh but they're still

550
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,320
28 percent Gap it's not 100 so which you

551
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,700
need other detection defense

552
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,240
capabilities uh so also we recommend

553
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,059
integrating multiple sources uh to get

554
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,760
most up-to-date data sets of bridge

555
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,320
credentials

556
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,480
um as you can see earlier after we

557
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,580
integrated new sources there are some

558
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,080
specs basically we have a better

559
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,199
coverage with new data sources

560
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,880
um so before we conclude here are some

561
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,940
takeaways again our detection methods

562
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,640
presented they are proactive and they

563
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,200
actually significantly helped our

564
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,539
sensitivity team deal with ATO side

565
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:36,720
skill we cannot prevent all eight heals

566
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,820
from happening at the beginning

567
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,860
um because the coverage will never be

568
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,340
100 so reactive approaches are still

569
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,860
very much needed

570
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,600
um so here are the Pinterest we do not

571
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,240
encourage we do not require email

572
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,740
confirmation or MFA but we do encourage

573
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,799
users to have email confirmed and have

574
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,460
mifa enabled so I think having a value

575
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,860
email is super important because if you

576
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,200
take some actions or do that for example

577
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,480
the actual user account you need them to

578
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,360
to to be able to come back and with 10

579
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,700
to use we normally use Gmail addresses

580
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,480
as social truth

581
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,340
so I want to thank some early

582
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,980
contributors to the project I mean who

583
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,460
did an Eric I also want to thank our

584
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,200
president Civic team for being our

585
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,240
awesome partner it's very especially

586
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
Carmen and the president I actually

587
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,039
trust and CeCe they have a blog post

588
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,159
about guarding which is a ruining and

589
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,600
actually we use gardening to create some

590
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,200
rules for the ATL protections

591
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,240
yeah that's it for our presentation

592
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,120
today uh thank you for joining us thank

593
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,239
