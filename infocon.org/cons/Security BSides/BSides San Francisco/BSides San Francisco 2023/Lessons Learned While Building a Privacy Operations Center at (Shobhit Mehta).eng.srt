1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,580
my name is shobhit and today I am going

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,220
to talk about Lessons Learned while

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,839
building a privacy Operation Center at

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,120
headspace health

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,519
before I jump into the talk a bit about

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,480
me

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,920
I am currently the security and

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,900
compliance director at space health

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,840
before that I had security and GRC roles

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,779
at HSBC Deutsche Bank people fitted

11
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:23,160
Investments

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,779
I did my masters in information

13
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,220
assurance and cyber security at

14
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,500
Northeastern Boston and I'm highly

15
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,560
interested in healthcare compliance

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,260
privacy running and writing so if you

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,300
have civil interest as mine please feel

18
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,980
free to connect after the talk and we

19
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,120
can have a very good conversation

20
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,260
so what are the goals for the talk today

21
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,180
and why we are here to speak about the

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,980
Privacy Operation Center at the first

23
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,420
place

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,719
the goal is to speak about why build a

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,600
dedicated POC at the first place

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,879
secondly I also want to talk about some

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,860
of the considerations for building a

28
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,260
privacy Operation Center

29
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,359
and lastly I want to leave you with some

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,099
guidance or initiating successful

31
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,740
privacy programs across multiple org

32
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,920
beat engineering privacy product or

33
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,280
legal

34
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,439
with the goals I also have few

35
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,240
assumptions that you have some

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,340
familiarity with privacy laws such as

37
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,840
gdpr CCPA cpra and you are kind of aware

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,000
for the requirements of HIPAA

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,159
Your Role is at the intersection of

40
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,640
privacy GRC product and engineering

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,340
and lastly you have at least one

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,040
security or privacy exec to Garner the

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,299
support from other management teams

44
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,460
now why why do we need to build a

45
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,840
privacy Operation Center in the first

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,100
place

47
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,799
first and foremost there are legal and

48
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,899
regulatory requirements coming up all

49
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:52,920
the time

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,720
if you're working in the industry you

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,159
are well aware of the different state

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,340
laws from New York Virginia of course

53
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,799
California gdpr and then some

54
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,020
requirements from HIPAA as well which

55
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,259
mandates that you work across uh

56
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,780
across the organization with different

57
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,379
teams to fulfill these requirements

58
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,599
secondly there are mandatory

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,700
requirements from the App Stores so on

60
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,620
the screen I have two screenshots one

61
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,200
from Apple the other one from Google

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,319
Apple mandates you to have a deletion

63
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,720
button in the app if you're allowing

64
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,180
your users to have a defect

65
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,220
functionality to create the the account

66
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,260
from the app itself

67
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,620
and secondly Google requires you to

68
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,540
declare all the data that you're

69
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,640
collecting from your third parties and

70
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,500
how you are sharing the data with your

71
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,099
third parties

72
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,340
third in the last quarter itself there

73
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,500
were three uh

74
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,580
FTC slabs from uh flaps on the FTC on

75
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,080
companies which are in the similar

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
spaces us and this the the second

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,620
screenshot is on the

78
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,260
HHS website where so far as of April

79
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,180
10th of 2023

80
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,180
there are 145 breaches reported on the

81
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,360
HSS website and this is that's not the

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,879
the right way for organizations to to

83
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,260
prevent their financial reputation

84
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,019
losses and once you have this POC it

85
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,480
becomes a lot easier to manage this

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,980
different uh requirements for for

87
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,440
compliance

88
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,140
and lastly there are there is always

89
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,959
this ongoing Midas scrutiny the

90
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,940
screenshot on the screen is from Mozilla

91
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,540
they publish this report called privacy

92
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,159
not included every year

93
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,220
and each year they give their score on

94
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,959
how the application is performing with

95
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,220
respect to their privacy and security

96
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,599
practices

97
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,060
this screenshot for headspace is from

98
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,340
last year where the results were not

99
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,340
very favorable for us and this is not

100
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,260
the the correct way to to work or

101
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,760
functional application where you have

102
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,260
like millions of users

103
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,060
using your application every single day

104
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,060
so it either helps you earn the trust of

105
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,099
your users or lose the trust of your

106
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,459
users

107
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,620
but with all that being said and while

108
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,900
we want to bring all of this together

109
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,418
we truly believe

110
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,600
that privacy is an existential risk for

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,580
headspace health

112
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,040
if we don't have privacy at the

113
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,320
Forefront of every single thing that we

114
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,160
do

115
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,139
it's going to be extremely hard for us

116
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,240
to compete and to survive in this space

117
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,240
and for that regard every single thing

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,060
that we do from releasing to a new

119
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,880
feature to building a new product we

120
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,919
have to have privacy at the Forefront of

121
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,159
everything

122
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,600
now before I jump into the price

123
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,940
Operation Center I always speak about

124
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,759
what privacy is and how I look at the

125
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,900
Privacy at the first place

126
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,100
first privacy is a fundamental human

127
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,060
right

128
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,340
if you are having privacy in your

129
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,680
product and application it's not an

130
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,780
add-on it's a fundamental human right

131
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,340
and you have to take care of that

132
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,320
secondly it's a competitive Advantage

133
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,600
for organizations I work with

134
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,940
prospective customers all the time and

135
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,680
once we have this this conversations

136
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,500
regarding our competitors and ours it

137
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,120
just becomes

138
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,280
evident that privacy is a competitive

139
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,620
Advantage for us and if we are showing

140
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,360
our leadership and thought leadership in

141
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,400
building this privacy practices it's

142
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,100
good for the organization

143
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,160
and lastly it's a foundation of trust we

144
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,840
have millions and millions of users

145
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,240
across the world and if you don't have

146
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,979
this Foundation of trust with our users

147
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,400
it's extremely hard for us to to survive

148
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,780
and grow

149
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,120
now how do we build this Foundation of

150
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,539
trust is an extremely simple process

151
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,740
first we make promises we make promises

152
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,800
via our privacy policies by our terms of

153
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,900
service by our notice of privacy

154
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,039
practices

155
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,500
and then secondly

156
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,440
we keep promises we don't want to do

157
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,020
anything which is not aligned with the

158
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,419
with the benefit of our customers or

159
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,699
which doesn't enrich the user experience

160
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,220
of our members so this is how we build

161
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,500
the foundation of trust just by making

162
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,460
promises and then keeping promises

163
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,020
secondly

164
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,000
we should also talk about what privacy

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,520
is not

166
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,300
so privacy is not only security and I

167
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,919
can give an example of that

168
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,979
let's say you are having your data

169
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,840
encrypted with the best encryption

170
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,160
methods in the world

171
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,380
and you have this encryption key

172
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,199
distributed to all the engineers

173
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,720
is that data really secure

174
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,139
yes but is the data really private when

175
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,360
all the engineers can access the data

176
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,900
no

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,819
secondly privacy is not a zero-sum game

178
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,759
privacy can and need to coexist with

179
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,460
Innovation efficiency transparency

180
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,520
usability and accountability

181
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,740
many times we have this contention with

182
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,120
the product teams and the engineering

183
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,400
teams that hey we want to build this

184
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,620
feature but we have to keep this into

185
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,419
account for our privacy

186
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:29,460
and we always come to this conclusion

187
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,259
that we have to coexist both of these

188
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,199
together it's not in either or for

189
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,660
privacy or usability

190
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,639
can anybody give you an example of a

191
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,440
company which does this really really

192
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,740
well

193
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Apple yep Apple does this really well

194
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,599
and they are like the Hallmark for us to

195
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,180
be uh to make sure that we don't take

196
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,539
privacy as a zero-sum game

197
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,900
and lastly privacy is not solely an

198
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,460
individual or organization's

199
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,840
responsibility

200
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,180
we need the legal and regulative

201
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,560
Frameworks to make sure that we have

202
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,360
boundaries defined

203
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,759
secondly we need the industry best

204
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,099
practices there are a lot of best

205
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,500
practices around security but there are

206
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,120
not best the best practices around

207
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
privacy that for example if I want to

208
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,379
share a piece of data with one of the

209
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,360
research Partners how should I go about

210
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,580
it that's still uh we don't have an

211
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,340
industry practice best practice for

212
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,120
and lastly we have to foster a culture

213
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,860
of privacy awareness

214
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,799
we speak a lot about security awareness

215
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
in the organizations that we want to

216
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,940
prevent malicious insiders we want to

217
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,620
make sure that all folks are aware of

218
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,140
the security practices at the company

219
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,600
but we don't give enough uh importance

220
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,220
to privacy awnings which is equally

221
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,180
important

222
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,279
this essentially means that do your

223
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,980
members know when they need to share

224
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,660
data with some other third parties what

225
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,820
communication tools they can use or are

226
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,339
your employees aware of the research

227
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,080
projects going on and how they can

228
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,580
anonymize the data for their research

229
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,060
purpose

230
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,820
and lastly I want to speak a bit about

231
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,040
the guiding principles of privacy before

232
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,980
jumping jumping into the POC

233
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,440
so for every single thing that we do at

234
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,720
headspace Health we Define principles

235
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,660
and then we do the actual work

236
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,580
we have principles for our technology

237
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,740
Arc we have principles for our Security

238
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,200
Org and while we were thinking about

239
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,880
having this privacy Operation Center

240
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,519
built we realized that we need to have

241
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,220
guiding principles so if there's ever an

242
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,440
Ever contention that which decision

243
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,480
should be the right decision for us we

244
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,100
can come back to these principles and

245
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,220
take our our guidance from these

246
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,500
first one is consent we want to be

247
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,540
extremely specific in the consent that

248
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,899
we ask but at the same time we want to

249
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:54,420
give this right to users to withdraw the

250
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,980
consent

251
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,040
second is accuracy we want the member

252
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,720
information to be accurate all the time

253
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,120
and they should have the right to

254
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,279
correct the information if there is an

255
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,899
incorrect information about our systems

256
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,459
or databases

257
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,680
third we want to secure all the

258
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,660
databases and we want to make sure that

259
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,740
there is no unauthorized access

260
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,740
disclosure or use via physical technical

261
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,980
administrative set cards

262
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,040
fourth we are accountable for complying

263
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,040
with all the legal and privacy

264
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,420
requirements

265
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,360
there is no other way around it we have

266
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,339
six or seven requirements that is

267
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,640
required by gdpr CCPA to comply and we

268
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,740
want to provide all those rights to our

269
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,600
members

270
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,180
next we want to be extremely transparent

271
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,279
about our data classification collection

272
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,920
used in Sharing practices what data

273
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,600
would we collect from our members what

274
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,160
data would we share with with other

275
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,440
members and so forth

276
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,360
next we want to make sure that the

277
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,380
information is confidential

278
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,440
and next we want to embed privacy by

279
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,899
Design from the Forefront of all the

280
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,820
systems that we develop

281
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,700
we truly believe that privacy should not

282
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,420
be an afterthought once we create the

283
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,959
applications also systems it has to be

284
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,899
integrated with the sdlc and I will

285
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,760
speak about it a bit more that how we

286
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,800
can integrate stlc and privacy together

287
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,980
if and when things go wrong we want to

288
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,899
make sure that we have the resources and

289
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,079
we are prepared to inform members uh in

290
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,339
a timely and transparent manner

291
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,140
we want to minimize the collection of

292
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,320
data that we use we don't want any data

293
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,240
that will not use for the benefit our

294
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,100
members which essentially means to

295
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,000
provide them either better

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,220
recommendations in the headspace app or

297
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,899
to just improve their experience when

298
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,240
they're using the application

299
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,660
and lastly while we are collecting all

300
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,779
this data if at some time we determine

301
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:03,200
that this data is not required anymore

302
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,360
we need to delete the data or at least

303
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,000
anonymize so it just doesn't hang around

304
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,279
as a as a risk that you are collecting a

305
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,660
lot of data which is not required

306
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,700
now what constitutes a POC at the first

307
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,600
place

308
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,399
so while we were thinking about building

309
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,620
this POC and there were like so many

310
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,779
things that we could do we realized

311
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,180
there were four things that we really

312
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,160
need to do and we could just bucket all

313
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,360
these things in this four pillars

314
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,620
the first one is governance in

315
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,360
management

316
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,839
the second one is Partnerships

317
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,399
the third one is tools

318
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,040
and lastly security and awareness so

319
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,420
every single thing that we were doing at

320
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,639
headspace Health we wanted to have all

321
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,800
of those bucketed in either of these

322
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,339
four buckets

323
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,779
over the next few slides what I want to

324
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,600
do is maybe take some guidance from what

325
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,160
we developed in our policies and

326
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,380
procedures and then go through each of

327
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,760
these different buckets and how we can

328
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,800
use that guidance for your data

329
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,420
classification and your your price

330
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,700
Operation Center

331
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,800
the first one is data management versus

332
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
data governance

333
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,300
this is the base of everything that we

334
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,100
do at headspace health

335
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,380
by data management I mean that you have

336
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,300
to have organized organization of your

337
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,639
data you should have the storage of your

338
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,160
data adequately protected you have to

339
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,019
protect the data and then you have to

340
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,839
maintain the data for adequate reasons

341
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,240
and if I talk about data governance it

342
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,920
essentially deals with Frameworks

343
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,300
policies procedures and distribution

344
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,120
now you can if I can sum up all the data

345
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,220
governance points in one word

346
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,160
that would be strategic all these things

347
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,320
are driven by strategy

348
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,779
and if I can sum up all the things on

349
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,360
the data management side that would be

350
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,760
classification which is the base of

351
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,860
every single thing that we do

352
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,240
so what I'm going to do what the next

353
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
few slides is to start from

354
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,899
classification and then slowly

355
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:13,940
transition into Data governance piece

356
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,360
so for data classification this is the

357
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,399
traditional data classification I'm sure

358
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,959
you all must have seen this in some form

359
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,720
or the other where you have public

360
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,920
confidential restricted or highly

361
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,060
restricted

362
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,880
but this data classification

363
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,100
did not fit our requirements because

364
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,019
headspace health is extremely unique we

365
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,180
are a Telehealth organization with two

366
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,040
products headspace which is on the

367
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,440
consumer side ginger on the care side

368
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,139
and this data classification just did

369
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,540
not fit our requirements

370
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,300
so in this case what we did was We

371
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,000
Invented our own

372
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,980
so this is the headspace Health Data

373
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,600
classification

374
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,519
on the First Column we have the parent

375
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,500
classification which is sensitive

376
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,680
private customer confidential company

377
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,860
confidential research and public

378
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,500
the second classification speaks to the

379
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,120
child classification which is Phi SBI

380
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,820
pii customer confidential and so forth

381
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,220
and there are a few examples for each of

382
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,240
these

383
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,639
so right now here is on the screen you

384
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,320
are seeing only two or three of these

385
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,279
examples

386
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,600
but when you are working with our

387
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,579
engineering teams we gave them at least

388
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,760
15 examples of each so when they are

389
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,320
doing their data tagging for disa

390
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,519
requests or when they are doing their

391
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,579
data tagging for a deletion request it

392
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,560
doesn't come as a surprise and they know

393
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,720
exactly how to categorize and tag the

394
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,019
data

395
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,079
but data classification is incomplete

396
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,820
without inventory

397
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,339
we all know that you can have the best

398
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,199
classification in the world but if you

399
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,060
are not inventoring your data and you're

400
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,220
not tagging your data it just doesn't

401
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,660
make any sense it will just line a

402
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,839
spreadsheet and nobody will use it

403
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,540
but at the same time complete data

404
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,880
inventory is extremely hard when we

405
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,380
started doing this for the first time

406
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,019
across the company we realized that this

407
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,060
is such a critical problem for

408
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,920
organizations which are unique which are

409
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,199
in healthcare or which are complying

410
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:19,019
with different requirements uh at the

411
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,360
same time such as gdpr and HIPAA which

412
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,800
information you should delete which

413
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,019
information you should hold it's just an

414
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,000
extremely hard problem

415
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,040
so what we did

416
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,620
we had this initial milestone for the

417
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,980
data inventory we wanted to have this

418
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,380
nine columns just the name purpose

419
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,440
internal external storage and the other

420
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,699
columns

421
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,800
fill this columns to the best of our

422
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,100
abilities for all the data that we had

423
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,620
and we thought that once we'll do this

424
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,259
exercise to the best of our abilities it

425
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,720
will make the other processes a lot

426
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,339
smoother

427
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,180
we did that and then we realized that

428
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,000
this only covered the information we

429
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,099
have it did not cover the information

430
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,859
that we were planning to uh

431
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,699
collect by uh provide new features or

432
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,859
via our new practices that we're

433
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,000
releasing

434
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,919
so we'll come back to this slide to

435
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,140
tackle this problem that they we did the

436
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,059
initial data classification but how

437
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:24,980
should we keep this data inventory alive

438
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,439
now relatedly I just have this one slide

439
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,780
for these are requests for those of you

440
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,419
who are not aware these SARS are data

441
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,419
subject access rise request where users

442
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,059
can come to you and then asked you to

443
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,580
delete your information or delete their

444
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,400
information ask further information and

445
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,900
there are six additional rights that

446
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,460
they can ask for

447
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,559
and while we were looking for a decent

448
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,020
tour in the market we realized that

449
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,600
there is no one-size-fits all

450
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,419
if you are in a Telehealth company you

451
00:17:57,419 --> 00:17:58,679
have to comply with the requirements of

452
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,700
gdpr CCPA but at the same time you also

453
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,080
have to comply with the requirements of

454
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,960
HIPAA which are very very unique HIPAA

455
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,820
requires you to retain all the data for

456
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,500
a period of time and you just can't

457
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,160
delete the data no matter what

458
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,620
so we realized that after uh the entire

459
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,740
year we spent on our demo and POC it's

460
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,480
just that not the right solution for us

461
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,419
so we build our solution for processing

462
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,660
the DSA request so this is one slide

463
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,980
that I wanted to highlight that if you

464
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,780
are thinking about onboarding a tool

465
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,419
such as one trust or security please be

466
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,280
extremely mindful that your use case

467
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,140
could be very very different from what

468
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,179
they are already serving and it just

469
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:40,919
might make more sense for you to to

470
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,960
build your own tool and not onboard one

471
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,240
of those tools

472
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,580
and lastly whatever you choose to do

473
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,320
just keep it alive if you are

474
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,600
inventoring your database make sure that

475
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,240
that's that's uh alive if you are having

476
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,760
your DSR till built yourself make sure

477
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,559
that the scripts that you have are up to

478
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,059
date and they are collecting or deleting

479
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,760
data when you are storing the data in a

480
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,220
new third party

481
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,080
so coming back to the earlier slide

482
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,260
where we only covered the data that we

483
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,539
already had and we only invented that

484
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:13,679
data

485
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,980
how it go about collecting the data or

486
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,260
inventing the data which will cover or

487
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,840
which will collect in the future

488
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,880
so for this phase we realized that

489
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,940
privacy impact assessments are extremely

490
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,500
helpful when you're collecting New

491
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,020
pieces of information from your members

492
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,720
but if I'm part of the security team and

493
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,559
I go to the product team and say hey I

494
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,539
need to do a privacy impact assessments

495
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,580
can you help me out with that

496
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,700
they'll be like no we have some road

497
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,039
maps for on our quarter and we have to

498
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,140
do this as soon as possible

499
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,260
and from my experience I realized that

500
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,620
anytime there is legal team in your

501
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,960
email chain it just makes the entire

502
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,940
conversation a lot easier

503
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,340
so I would implore you to make legal

504
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,620
team use best friend for every single

505
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,280
thing that you're doing

506
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,900
now this is one of the procedures that

507
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,299
we developed across headspace health and

508
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:13,740
while we want to do a privacy impact

509
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,360
assessment for each of the new features

510
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,880
we realize that unless and until we have

511
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,980
a dedicated workflow for how we want to

512
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,260
do that with the product teams and the

513
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,059
engineering teams it's not going to

514
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:25,740
serve our purpose

515
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,320
so on the screen right now we have three

516
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,720
different buckets product engineering

517
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,120
legal privacy and security

518
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,679
and this is something that we recently

519
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,919
rolled out that every time we want to

520
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,020
build a new feature at headspace health

521
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,960
it goes via this reviews

522
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,960
so the product team they built their PRD

523
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,660
they give the PRD to the incident team

524
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,120
the incident team creates a text back in

525
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,400
later relation to the PRD

526
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,860
both of those are submitted to the

527
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,500
security privacy and legal team for

528
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,299
their reviews

529
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,520
the legal team performs their own review

530
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,280
which essentially means checking all the

531
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,600
regulatory requirements that we need to

532
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,440
fulfill

533
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,539
for example if you want to roll out a

534
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:12,059
new feature in France the French

535
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,100
authorities want all the Privacy

536
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,140
policies in terms of service in French

537
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,299
so those are some things that we want to

538
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,400
highlight as much as as early in the

539
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,559
process as possible rather than going to

540
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,480
the product event saying hey we did all

541
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,100
the development but we still don't

542
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,340
comply with all the legal requirements

543
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,919
the second thing is the Privacy review

544
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,220
now here privacy team they go in and

545
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,280
make sure that every single piece of pii

546
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,559
Slash Phi we are collecting

547
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,620
it's cataloged it's remarked that why we

548
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,600
are collecting that pii and then if we

549
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,760
need to minimize that data collection we

550
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,100
propose that to the product team

551
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,500
and lastly the security team performs

552
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,679
the threat modeling on that PRD so if I

553
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,320
receive a new feature request uh me or

554
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,820
either my team they perform the threat

555
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,620
modeling

556
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,260
and also once we develop the feature we

557
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,419
conduct an internal pen test so if you

558
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,039
are releasing a feature which is going

559
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,080
to affect millions of users we don't

560
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,820
want to roll that feature out unless we

561
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,460
do an internal pen test so we created

562
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,980
this entire workflow to make sure that

563
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,480
all of these different pieces are

564
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,799
covered

565
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:22,679
once we do all of these we propose our

566
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,840
recommendations to the product team some

567
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,640
of these are blockers some of these are

568
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,919
good to have but this has served us

569
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:31,020
really really well so far

570
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,299
we rolled out this process in April of

571
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:36,000
this year and so far we pen tested three

572
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,760
features we've been tested we reviewed

573
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,280
four prds and tech specs and this just

574
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,460
uh streamlines the process a lot more

575
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,620
when you have the entire chain in your

576
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,100
jira ticket

577
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,380
now while we want to have all these

578
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,720
processes done we don't want our

579
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,539
Engineers to keep hanging in and just

580
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,460
thinking hey what we are doing to embed

581
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,460
privacy by Design in the sdlc

582
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,679
so right now we use these three tools

583
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:07,620
for shifting our privacy Focus from left

584
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,020
to right

585
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,820
the first one is Privado

586
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,240
and what Privado does is every time a

587
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,299
developer asks for a new piece of pii or

588
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,980
Phi in the code

589
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,400
it asks for a reason that hey I see you

590
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,039
are collecting this piece of pii can you

591
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,900
give a rational that why do we need to

592
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,039
put this piece of information in the

593
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,020
first place

594
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,760
secondly

595
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,280
uh now we are at a better space where we

596
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,900
are much more mature in our data

597
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,880
classification and labeling and now we

598
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,860
move to Amazon glue for automating all

599
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,100
of these and then lastly data governance

600
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,840
which is equally important

601
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,419
so while we are planning to shift all

602
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,820
our privacy by Design Focus towards the

603
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,100
left we realize that it's extremely

604
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,780
important to have this towards the right

605
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,980
as well

606
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,799
and I didn't give an example so let's

607
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,559
say if there are headspace engineers and

608
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,179
they want to

609
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,419
access a database which is for ginger

610
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:09,000
it just makes no sense why somebody who

611
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,559
is working on a different product they

612
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,500
need to have access to another database

613
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,240
and what we did was with the help of

614
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,039
this tool we

615
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,980
created some guide guide uh guard rails

616
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,720
and policy so that every time this

617
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,360
happens we receive a notification or

618
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,620
either their manager receives a

619
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,600
certification saying hey this is

620
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,159
happening do you approve of that or

621
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,900
what's going on

622
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,760
so this is our effort of Shifting

623
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,500
privacy from left to right which is

624
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,539
still in the operationalizing phase but

625
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:37,799
we are really really hopeful for this

626
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,980
month

627
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,820
this is something that you're still

628
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,200
trying to operationalize at headspace

629
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,240
Health which is the Privacy threat

630
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,940
modeling so while we have a very very

631
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,220
good team of our doing the security

632
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,320
threat modeling we realize that it's

633
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
it's a budding requirement that we have

634
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,860
to have a privacy threat modeling as

635
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,880
well

636
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,760
so while I was researching all the

637
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,559
Privacy thread modeling papers uh this

638
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,880
is one of the papers that Professor

639
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,360
hoppin wrote and he divided the entire

640
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,880
privacy threat modeling in just two

641
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,500
buckets

642
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,559
the first one is data oriented where he

643
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,659
says just minimize the data you are

644
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:18,360
collecting extract the collection of the

645
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,799
data or to make sure that you are

646
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,840
limiting the processing of the data

647
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,720
separate the processing of the data and

648
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,580
then lastly when you don't need it any

649
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,100
further just delete the data or make it

650
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,620
unlinkable

651
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,840
the process oriented is extremely simple

652
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,799
as well

653
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,159
inform your users about the processing

654
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,559
provide control to your members so that

655
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,419
they can refrain from processing their

656
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:43,799
data

657
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,200
enforce this processing in a privacy

658
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,520
friendly manner

659
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,860
and then lastly demonstrate that you are

660
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,080
doing all of these in a privacy friendly

661
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,520
manner

662
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,960
so this is something that is still

663
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,200
operationalizing at headspace health and

664
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,700
hopefully we'll take our own split

665
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,679
quarter to to learn about this model and

666
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,360
operationalize this a lot more in the in

667
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,199
the upcoming quarters

668
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,000
the fourth bucket is security and

669
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,919
awareness so while we talked about

670
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,080
governance and management while we

671
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,419
talked about the tools while we talked

672
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:16,919
about the Partnerships with the legal

673
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,659
teams and the product teams and privacy

674
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:19,559
teams

675
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,380
it's equally important to focus on

676
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,720
privacy awareness because this is one of

677
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,640
the most important reasons for for

678
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,140
developing this entire privacy Operation

679
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,000
Center

680
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,700
so what we did at headspace Health we

681
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,620
developed our own HIPAA security

682
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,760
trainings

683
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,679
which essentially means that this is

684
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,799
extremely catered to headspace health I

685
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,960
have seen a lot of organizations using

686
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,880
hippo trainings from organizations or

687
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,520
just LMS platforms which is extremely

688
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,500
generic and it did not have a server

689
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,460
purpose for example we don't allow Phi

690
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,580
to be shared via slack but it's just so

691
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,919
hard to to let the all the users know or

692
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,179
the employees know that this is not

693
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,940
allowed so we created our own headspace

694
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,179
health uh specific hip-hop training

695
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,419
we have monthly office hours with our

696
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,140
CSO and the DPO and what we do is we

697
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,820
open this office hours for the entire

698
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,159
company so they can come in and ask any

699
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,140
questions that they have to the CSO and

700
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,659
the DPO and all the questions that they

701
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:24,299
ask are then cataloged in our Master

702
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,340
privacy FAQ

703
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,380
so every single thing that we do we have

704
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,500
like a 50 page master privacy FAQ which

705
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,360
speaks to the Privacy practices for

706
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,820
headspace security practices for

707
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,520
headspace and then similarly for ginger

708
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,919
and then we have dedicated channels for

709
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:42,360
our research team and engineering team

710
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,740
so if they have any questions they don't

711
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,720
have to go back and forth they can ask

712
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,039
those questions right there and then

713
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,100
which just keeps uh the knowledge

714
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,740
cohesive across multiple teams

715
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,380
and lastly we have a privacy intranet

716
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,380
for all the all the open for all the

717
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,340
company

718
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,740
and in that privacy form when new hires

719
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,159
join we implore them to just go through

720
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,539
the internet read through the master

721
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,419
privacy FAQ and ask as many questions

722
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:12,120
that they have in the form of a wire

723
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,320
form

724
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,419
so once we have this form we answer

725
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:18,000
respond to that question and then all

726
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,500
that knowledge goes into our privacy

727
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,779
Master FAQ which is open for the entire

728
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,020
company

729
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,340
all right so I just want to summarize

730
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,140
this this entire presentation is in

731
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,779
three bullets first recognize that

732
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,539
privacy is hard and Industry guidance is

733
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:39,240
weak we have a lot of Industry guidance

734
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,799
on security via Nest via sock via ISO

735
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,559
but the industry guidance on let's say

736
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,480
data sharing practices or how to comply

737
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,900
with gdpr it's extremely innocent right

738
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,000
now and there's a need to have this

739
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,659
industry guidance uh more robust

740
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,880
secondly there is always an opportunity

741
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,100
to improve and this is something that we

742
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,539
learned while we were doing our data

743
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,299
inventory when we had this initial Excel

744
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,100
sheet filled out we were like we have

745
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,740
all the data invented now we are doing a

746
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:13,260
wonderful job but then we realized that

747
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,480
we did not account for any of the

748
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,679
information that we collect in the

749
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,559
future and then we need to uh update our

750
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,720
scripts that we use for our DSA requests

751
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,760
and then we realized that this always

752
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,700
always an opportunity to improve

753
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,279
and lastly when in doubt just ask

754
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,860
yourself how this will look like on the

755
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,020
front page of wwsj

756
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,299
which essentially means that if you are

757
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,279
not sure that hey should I make this

758
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,799
decision for the users or should I make

759
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,960
this decision for the product just ask

760
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,299
yourself and let this question guide you

761
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,640
on your decisions and influence your

762
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,899
decisions with the other teams as well

763
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,659
these are the three takeaways that I

764
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,500
have

765
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,399
first one is security enables privacy

766
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:02,520
there is no other way around it security

767
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,779
has to be married to privacy and as much

768
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:08,460
as we want to segregate both of these

769
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,200
it's just that they have to be married

770
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,360
and they have to they have to work

771
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,500
cohesively to enable privacy practices

772
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,620
second put Members First this is one of

773
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,720
the headspace health values that for

774
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,480
every single thing that we do we want to

775
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,360
put our Members First and give them the

776
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,220
reason of Doubt or Reason of benefit

777
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,159
that if we are in a contention that we

778
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,679
should we do this or not we should

779
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,159
should just take this uh value Ginger

780
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,600
value that we want to put our Members

781
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,659
First and keep this into into account at

782
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,580
all times

783
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,940
and then lastly we want to build the

784
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,799
world's most trusted Mental Health

785
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,880
Organization

786
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,520
and we recognize that it's not possible

787
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,080
without the support of the industry and

788
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,940
without the support of external external

789
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:57,899
members

790
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,539
so if I presented something on the slide

791
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:01,980
that you don't agree with or you have

792
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,080
any additional thoughts please let me

793
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,399
know when we can work together on

794
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:06,960
building practices which can be shared

795
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,600
across the industry uh Telehealth is an

796
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,460
extremely new industry for the entire

797
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,799
world and we are all finding good

798
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:16,380
practices for security and compliance so

799
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,000
if you have such practices or if you

800
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,620
agree disagree with any of the things

801
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,360
that I spoke about please let me know

802
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,679
when we can we can have a very very

803
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,740
thoughtful discussion on that

804
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,320
lastly few resources

805
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,700
I talked a lot about the marrying

806
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,740
security and privacy and and making sure

807
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,480
that we have this guiding principles of

808
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,500
privacy

809
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,140
so I'm I wrote this book they see a

810
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,580
serious handbook and there's this

811
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,820
chapter 17 where I kind of jotted all

812
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,980
these thoughts in extremely detailed

813
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,559
manner that when we think about having

814
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,899
privacy and security go hand in hand how

815
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:53,580
it should look like what each of these

816
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,559
principles mean how companies should

817
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,000
look at privacy threat modeling and so

818
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,980
forth so that's one resource that I

819
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,419
would highly recommend

820
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,820
the second one is conferences there are

821
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,460
two conferences the use next paper and

822
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,260
then the rise of privacy Tech which are

823
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,000
extremely informative

824
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,020
the third resource is the is what was my

825
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,840
starting point for for my work in

826
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,039
privacy

827
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,659
I am from the security and compliance

828
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:21,120
world and I had no idea about how to

829
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,299
start in the Privacy world and when I

830
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:25,860
read this paper for the first time a

831
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,980
taxonomy of privacy it just opened the

832
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,559
entire world for me there are so many

833
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,080
wonderful nuggets in this in this paper

834
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,600
that if you are remotely involved in

835
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,679
privacy and security you should

836
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,299
absolutely read that one

837
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:42,480
and lastly IPP which has their own set

838
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,580
of resources they have a lot of

839
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,440
different

840
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,720
resources and trainings that you can you

841
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,360
can use but I would highly recommend at

842
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,039
least number three which is a taxonomy

843
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,600
of privacy that's just super super

844
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,640
helpful

845
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,039
this is my contact information my email

846
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,260
showhead jrcmusics.com where I haven't

847
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,120
wrote in a long time and then my

848
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,159
LinkedIn and the slides will be

849
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,399
available at the last URL so if you

850
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,080
missed any of the slides and you wanted

851
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,760
to to have the picture you can download

852
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,399
the entire sites from there

853
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,100
all right that's all I have I'll open

854
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,240
the forum for any questions now

855
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,720
encryption or

856
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,820
other data masking techniques in use

857
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,299
yeah we so the tool or the question is

858
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,340
with our encryption or inventory that we

859
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,159
are doing are we also doing the

860
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,899
encryption methods or we are tagging the

861
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,940
encryption methods as well so all of

862
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,740
that is taken care by the data

863
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,419
governance tool that we're using it

864
00:33:57,419 --> 00:33:59,340
shows this data is encrypted or for

865
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,559
example if there's a bucket on S3 which

866
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:04,019
is not encrypted which has Phi it just

867
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:05,640
shows that you have this bucket you have

868
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,080
all this Pi in here which is not

869
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,359
encrypted so that data governance tool

870
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,520
becomes extremely handy when we want to

871
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,320
do a risk assessment on our inventory or

872
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,159
all the data sources

873
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,139
okay

874
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,000
how do you

875
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,119
handle that as far as default options go

876
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,239
and ensuring you don't overwhelm users

877
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,480
with all the Privacy choices

878
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,820
yeah the question is how do we remain

879
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,918
transparent with all the Privacy

880
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,619
practices without overwhelming the users

881
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,020
and for this one we always take this

882
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,060
approach which is best for the users I

883
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,260
would like to answer that with the help

884
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,780
of one of an example

885
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,260
in gdpr you are required to have a

886
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,140
cookie consent disabled by default but

887
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,560
in GD CCPA or the US it's not required

888
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,740
it's an opt out not opt-in

889
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,480
so when we have to make this decision of

890
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,540
opt out versus opt-in we always keep

891
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,240
users privacy at the Forefront so right

892
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,160
now if you go to the headspace.com

893
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,280
website or ginger.com website all of

894
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,640
those are opt in you have to opt into

895
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,180
all of those choices we don't have that

896
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,700
as opt-in for the US even if the law

897
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,040
permits that because we think we should

898
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,020
always be extremely mindful of data that

899
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,520
we're collecting and that may not be

900
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,880
required

901
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,140
sorry which resources you spoke of

902
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,400
uh could you repeat your question

903
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,579
uh yeah it just just struck me that a

904
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,380
lot of the problems you're solving here

905
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,079
with data labeling and and uh and

906
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,400
handling

907
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,200
um is reminiscent of uh National

908
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,839
Security data in in some ways I'm just

909
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:28,920
wondering if you've looked at that and

910
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,420
looked for parallels or ways you can

911
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,480
utilize existing approaches yeah next

912
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,579
recently released their framework around

913
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:37,500
privacy as well while they have a bunch

914
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,599
of things on security they came up with

915
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,359
this framework on privacy and when we

916
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:43,920
were looking at this framework we

917
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,660
realized that that's not really

918
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,000
applicable for Telehealth so we had to

919
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,280
build our own practices that's good for

920
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,440
a general sense and general privacy

921
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,859
practices but while we want to take this

922
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,619
industry standards for Telehealth it

923
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:00,359
just becomes extremely hard because we

924
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:03,540
have to have compliance with HIPAA and

925
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,440
then there are bunch of different

926
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,900
regulations as well so we were not able

927
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,700
to implement any of those industry

928
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,579
standards for our own company

929
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,480
thanks yeah

930
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,020
all right any additional questions

931
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,280
comments thoughts

932
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,060
okay I'll take that as a no and maybe

933
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,520
give you a 12 minutes back oh you have a

934
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,640
question

935
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,500
I guess out of curiosity out of

936
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,440
curiosity uh did your company ever look

937
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,540
at things like zero knowledge proofs and

938
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,280
some of those you know up and coming

939
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Technologies for your implementation and

940
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,900
I guess do you have any thoughts on

941
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,579
those those Technologies

942
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,740
yeah I had one slide here which I

943
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,020
intentionally did not present which was

944
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,940
around the world architecture that we

945
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,400
developed so what we did we we have this

946
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,079
patent in our Cesar with many of the

947
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,760
engineers we developed this architecture

948
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,839
on our own

949
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,660
where the encryption key for our crown

950
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,820
jewels is stored on the browser itself

951
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,880
so while we have all that information on

952
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,520
databases that's all encrypted but we

953
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,200
also have another layer of encryption

954
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,660
which is stored it stays on the browser

955
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,359
so the public key that stays in the

956
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,280
browser in one of the password managers

957
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,339
that public key always goes to the

958
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:40,140
private key of that particular system

959
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,960
and then that data is decrypted slash

960
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,599
encrypted on the browser itself on the

961
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,260
endpoints and not at the at the database

962
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,599
level so we have two sets of encryption

963
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,660
one at the database level and then also

964
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,700
at the endpoint level which is at the

965
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,200
browser

966
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,720
so that kind of serves as our purpose

967
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,020
for zero trust knowledge or whatever you

968
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,560
called that out uh we are not looking at

969
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,000
if you are asking about homomorphic

970
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,859
encryption or something like that we

971
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:13,380
haven't looked into that at this moment

972
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,460
all right can't you know that's

973
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,480
interesting thank you yeah

974
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,120
thank you all right thank you

975
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,000
[Applause]
