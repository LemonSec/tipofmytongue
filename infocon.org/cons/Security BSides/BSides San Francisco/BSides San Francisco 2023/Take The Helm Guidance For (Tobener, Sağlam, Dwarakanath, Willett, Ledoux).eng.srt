miserably and also I was by myself so

51
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,100
even if I did break it no one would have

52
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,339

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,140

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,040
um and uh kind of on the same theme uh I

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,599
I grew up in Turkey

60
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,580
um outside of this country and then I

61
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,560
ended up here uh mostly on the East

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,660
Coast uh Washington DC worked uh there

63
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,300
for World Bank for about eight years

64
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,700
um did like a lot of cyber security and

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,040
network security there and then uh then

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,900
I ended up here in the Bay Area and then

67
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,720
uh worked at Apple Salesforce Lending

68
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,879
Club and back to Salesforce

69
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,920
um all some of them are mostly like

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,660
engineering roles and then some of them

71
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,060
are leadership roles and now I'm a head

72
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,620
of security and compliance at a small

73
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,840
company called dremion we do data lake

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,580
houses

75
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,220
um fun fact about me um so many of them

76
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,580
but let's choose one um I got escorted

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,019
out of a pretty important uh Las Vegas

78
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,900
um Hotel because I kind of hacked into

79
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,120
there I didn't I didn't want to I just

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,819
touched the Four Corners one of those uh

81
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,640
kind of like interactive panels and uh

82
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,379
just if you do that thing at the lobby

83
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,300
the definition of the shortest amount of

84
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,519
time is you touching those four corners

85
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,200
and you're being escorted out so that's

86
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,599
pretty pretty quick like this we're just

87
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,220
gorgeous

88
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,700
um I'm Katie Ledoux I am from Boston I

89
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,640
still live in Boston I'll just die there

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,040
in the snow clutching a Dunkin Donuts

91
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,799
iced coffee I just can't escape

92
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,500
um I uh spent most of my career at

93
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,940
rapid7

94
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,580
cyber security vendor but I was on their

95
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,860
internal security team

96
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,940
um I built the security team at another

97
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,940
uh data company like drumeo um called

98
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,340
visitor a competitor

99
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,060
um called uh Starburst it was very

100
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,379
annoying to work there because a lot of

101
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,599
people ask me about the candy

102
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,280
um and it was so frustrating that I left

103
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,060
to start these security team at

104
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,620
attentive where I am now and

105
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,600
um I have I have two cats that are named

106
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,180
after the de Chanel sisters that's my

107
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,979
fun fact we were gonna name them after

108
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,960
A-list celebrities but then our friend

109
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,520
pointed out that they really aren't like

110
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,800
they're very generic shelter cats and so

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,120
we should name them after Sela

112
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,880
celebrities so we named them after uh

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,280
Zoe Deschanel and Emily Deschanel but we

114
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,780
call that one bones because she's the

115
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,060
main character in Bones

116
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,699
let's see

117
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:50,639
hi everyone I'm Kyle tobiner I grew up

118
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,960

125
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,720

126
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,919
pre-pandemic I used to run the largest

127
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,560
board game night in San Francisco and

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,699
this is actually relevant because I'll

129
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,300
mention this later

130
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,620
and lastly I am Divya dwarkanath I'm a

131
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,360
senior manager at snap and I'm really

132
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,259
enjoying being responsible for

133
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,400
appsecorbsec red team and supply chain

134
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,220
security and a fun fact about me is that

135
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,419
I'm a big Lakers fan

136
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,860
um but so

137
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,720
let's get started

138
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,100
um why did you want to be a CSO and when

139
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,680
did you think was the right time to step

140
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,400
into the role

141
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,460
I'll start

142
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,740
I haven't decided yet if I would like to

143
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,360
be a CSO

144
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,919
um for folks uh who I've chatted

145
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,199
about this with of whom there are

146
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,240
several in this room uh I have been

147
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,100
incredibly adamant about not wanting to

148
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,560
be the head of security uh for a very

149
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,820
very long time

150
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,160
and yet here I am talking to all of you

151
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,560
about being ahead of security uh I

152
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,720
recently sat down and

153
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,240
thought through like what it was that

154
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,100
made me not want to be ahead of security

155
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,900
and came up with uh two reasons one was

156
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,819
the politics

157
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,860
are terrible

158
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,940
um

159
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,520
and the second was a huge case of

160
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,100
imposter syndrome uh and when I moved to

161
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,860
ngrok the company was around 30 folks

162
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,080
and so the politics were just like

163
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,520
there's not really that many politics at

164
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,620
a 30 person company and we've grown

165
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,000
since then but

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,660
um

167
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,639
having a supportive boss in a sport of

168
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,000
CEO and cro about security meant that I

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,319
wasn't having a lot of the struggles

170
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,680
that I'd seen prior csos have that I had

171
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,560
worked for and um so really then all

172
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,960
that was left was uh my imposter

173
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,880
syndrome of which that was kicked out of

174
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,979
me by several friends of mine some of

175
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,539
whom are sitting at this table with me

176
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,100
and

177
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,099
um so I had a conversation with the CTO

178
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,620
who I report to and right now I'm kind

179
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,800
of just trying it out uh to kind of see

180
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,000
how I feel about it and if it's

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,319
something that I really don't want to do

182
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,699
or if it was just something that I

183
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,780
didn't want to do because I wasn't in

184
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,000
the right place

185
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,900
um and so that's how I ended up here so

186
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,539
to answer the question I'm not sure and

187
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,240
also I feel like it's uh whatever is

188
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,979
right for you whenever it feels right in

189
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,440
like your career and also your personal

190
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,940
life because I feel like it's it's a

191
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,440
it's a big job and it's a big commitment

192
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,240
did you have certain skill sets that you

193
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,800
thought that okay I can use this

194
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,220
um yes and yes and no uh I think part of

195
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,599
the thing that kind of helped me realize

196
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,280
that that was a thing that I was ready

197
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,440
for was uh when I first joined I was the

198
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,060
only security person again 30 person

199
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,520
company when I started and so I was kind

200
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,560
of already doing all of security and

201
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,360
already thinking about security strategy

202
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,740
and where we should go next and where

203
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,539
who we should hire

204
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:25,620
um and

205
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,960
uh I think that doing that helped me

206
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,120
realize like oh I can do this with just

207
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,700
a team as well and as the company grows

208
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,140
and so that was kind of the thing that

209
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,940
made me sit up and realize that this was

210
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,640
something that I felt ready to to step

211
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,819
into

212
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,600
so I just I it is I know politics is

213
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,540
kind of an icky word and it is a big

214
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,459
part of a leadership job

215
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:53,839
um but I actually love the politics of

216
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,760
my job uh yeah I so I knew that I wanted

217
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,760
to be in this type of role if I

218
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,620
when I first moved into a management

219
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,320
role and I would think back about okay

220
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,440
what was the best what was the highlight

221
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,720
from my week it was always something

222
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,320
that had to do with the people on the

223
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,300
team so it was like oh we got someone's

224
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,060
H-1B visa thing figured out like that's

225
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,040
so sick or

226
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,500
um you know I think also we've all been

227
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,040
on teams that have a really thoughtful

228
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,380
strategy where people are getting

229
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,600
consistent feedback on what they can be

230
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,720
doing differently where people are you

231
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,660
know you feel like you're set up to

232
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,459
bring your best self to work and we've

233
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:44,640
also been on teams where the leadership

234
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,720
doesn't deliver on that consistently

235
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,100
um so you know it sounds really like

236
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,080
kind of corny like management book

237
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,800
whatever but like the the multiplying

238
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,519
effect that you can have on a team and

239
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,459
I'm not saying I'm perfect at my job and

240
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,500
I I always kill it in this department

241
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,779
but it's really exciting for me to have

242
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,580
the opportunity to have a multiplying

243
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,779
effect on the amazing members of our

244
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,760
team by making sure we have a clear

245
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,100
strategy by making sure I'm removing

246
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,600
anything that gets in the way of them

247
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,779
doing their job like that is so fun for

248
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,899
me

249
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,560
awesome

250
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,940
um Emery how about you why Cecil

251
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,000
um I never wanted to be one

252
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,260
um a lot of people told me I would be

253
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,839
good at it and I kind of followed their

254
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,339
advice I follow a lot of advice

255
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:41,339
sometimes terrible advices but

256
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,920
um I and then the the only thing that I

257
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,860
knew that actually real that

258
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,019
not much advice driven but kind of like

259
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,540
internal driven was that I've been all

260
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,180
over the security all over like from uh

261
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,660
server security to network security for

262
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,760
all the guys there who know what that is

263
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,579
so they used to be cyber security

264
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,740
um and then um like from there to like

265
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,120
forensics to

266
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,700
um I don't know like um firefighting to

267
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,920
operations to product security to

268
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,300
Enterprise security literally I've Been

269
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,579
Everywhere on on that spectrum and that

270
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,980
kind of prepared me for the guidance

271
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,600
that I give right now that I feel

272
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,279
extremely uh

273
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,440
lucky I guess to to be able to do that

274
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,720
and I think that that kind of

275
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,760
made my decision right hey I've been

276
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,500
here I've been there I know about this

277
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,940
stuff I know a lot this stuff I've seen

278
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,440
the terrible version of this stuff I've

279
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,420
seen the great version of that stuff so

280
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,399
how can we make it

281
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,380
how can I make it my own company's stuff

282
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,880
right so that's kind of helped me a lot

283
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,440
and then um

284
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,940
there has been a lot of people who

285
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,519
really like pushed me uh from my Corners

286
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,740
like it's first in the IC corner I was

287
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,060
I'm like I'm gonna I'm gonna break

288
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,820
things that's it and then uh no no you

289
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,260
should build good stuff okay all right

290
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,820
I'm gonna build good stuff and then uh

291
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,640
and in fact maybe you should lead a team

292
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,899
nah

293
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,079
technology is easy human heart so and

294
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,620
then I ended up doing one and then um

295
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,200
it's kind of I I it kind of sounds like

296
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,760
I didn't want to do any of these I

297
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,160
actually did want it but uh I needed a

298
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,740
little bit like push just do it dude so

299
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,040
yeah it's kind of how it happened for me

300
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,200
was it similar for Yuka like did you

301
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,060
have various different domain

302
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,920
experiences that made you feel that

303
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,040
you're ready or you know you know what

304
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,440
was it you know I had in my mind this

305
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,940
picture that I had to get to a certain

306
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,339
title in order to kind of be worthy of

307
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,820
doing the doing the move uh and I had a

308
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,620
really good conversation with with Mike

309
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,420
Johnson who's been at CSO for a while

310
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,800
about two years ago and he was like

311
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
don't be stupid you're ready now just go

312
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
same here and I was like okay then let's

313
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,600
try and he was totally right I you know

314
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,160
I interviewed at a lot of places and I

315
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,720
was found some really good options and

316
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,040
settled on one that I was really excited

317
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,219
about

318
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,779
um you'll mentioned like politics

319
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,820
briefly and you know certain skill sets

320
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,200
like that you picked up through

321
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
different domains

322
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,019
um

323
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,500
what what skill set do you think that

324
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,540
someone should start developing if they

325
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,480
don't have already before they go and uh

326
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,000
accept the Cesar role

327
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,700
so when you when you think about the the

328
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,440
like the

329
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,200
first time see so kind of job the most

330
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,440
common one is like a a small SAS company

331
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,079
that's you know maybe series B series C

332
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,139
and starting to scale and in that

333
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,360
environment

334
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,500
understanding all the different pieces

335
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,240
of the business and how they function

336
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,980
and why they need to do what they do I

337
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,600
think is really really important so for

338
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,120
me owning vendor security at Salesforce

339
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,920
was one of the best things I ever did

340
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,019
for my career because it taught me

341
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,300
through what everyone was buying to you

342
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,279
know automate and scale what their

343
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,540
business needs were and what their

344
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,060
challenges were and then dropping into a

345
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,279
much much smaller company the challenges

346
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,500
and problems were identical and so that

347
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,779
really helped me you know get a foothold

348
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,860
with all the different business

349
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,279
departments I needed to influence

350
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,040
I've been really surprised

351
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,380
um I suppose I thought that this job

352
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,019
would be trying to convince people that

353
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,120
security matters

354
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,860
um I've found a surprising amount of

355
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,779
this job is actually uh contextualizing

356
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:24,180
individual risks humans are really bad

357
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,700
at the the risk management calculation

358
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,459
like the the likelihood times impact and

359
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,120
sometimes when a new threat arises and

360
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,500
it's being talked about at really any

361
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,160
level of the company people focus on the

362
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,420
worst possible outcome and not the

363
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,899
likely outcome and not the the the

364
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,000
likelihood of it happening or not

365
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,959
happening

366
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,420
um which is you know so there's a lot of

367
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,339
passion of oh we need to fix this right

368
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,660
now because they're thinking of the

369
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,339
worst possible thing that could come to

370
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,560
fruition which maybe seems great if

371
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,120
you're like well you run security don't

372
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,740
you want everyone to throw all of the

373
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,060
resources at that

374
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,399
if that's the way that you run the

375
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,500
program it can be very like you know

376
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,720
chasing shiny objects and then if you're

377
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,760
investing your time there then you're

378
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,260
not investing your time in something

379
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,660
that maybe is a bigger risk because it

380
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,579
is more likely to happen

381
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,100
um and so I think

382
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,839
that the skill set that I'd be

383
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,959
developing is when a new

384
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,260
threat arises and someone brings it to

385
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,740
your team helping them and yourself sort

386
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,480
of contextualize

387
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,839
what is the real risk instead of let's

388
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,300
throw all of our resources on this right

389
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,220
now like let's let's actually approach

390
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,519
it in a more thoughtful calculated way

391
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,019
because especially as a leader of a

392
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,000
program you can't be people are going to

393
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,740
get burnt out if every single time

394
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,540
something comes up you're you're

395
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,639
sprinting towards fixing that and then

396
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,899
you've got 75 percent of the way there

397
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:57,300
and a new threat or risk comes up and

398
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,380
you start sprinting in the other

399
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,459
direction

400
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,139
um so that that's something that I would

401
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:03,839
start noodling on

402
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,420
I saw Emery shaking his head vigorously

403
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,300
when he started no I I was shaking my

404
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,880
head with the risk risk gauge of people

405
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,579
and it's just terrible people are

406
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,420
terrible risk

407
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,740
I don't know what we have as it risk

408
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,060
calculator I don't know how we survived

409
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,160
in being like eight billion people did

410
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,380
we make terrible decisions

411
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,980
um in addition to that I think one thing

412
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,920
that helped me a lot is empathy and uh

413
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,839
that kind of

414
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,399
um empathy with the developer empathy

415
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,899
with the business empathy with the

416
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,660
customer especially and uh that that

417
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,579
helps a lot driving some of these

418
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:45,240
terrible risk calculation mattresses in

419
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,120
our in our head for example

420
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,959
um

421
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,079
should we shut down this thing and you

422
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,880
have some sort of experience that you

423
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,680
know that the likelihood of shutting it

424
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,040
down is not gonna

425
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,300
impact the business that much or

426
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,160
likelihood of that shutting it down is

427
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,540
going to impact the business a lot but

428
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,040
not not actually a risk maybe we

429
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,660
shouldn't shut it down right yeah we

430
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,579
should let it do something and then peel

431
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,140
a plan accordingly right that's some

432
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,900
sort of an empathy on on not not just a

433
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,400
yep there's there's something there

434
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,199
let's shut down this that's risky right

435
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,599
that's that make it being able to make

436
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,939
that call and in the position

437
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,740
to make that cause actually pretty scary

438
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,199
but but still like uh I think that's

439
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,540
where the input helps a lot and then uh

440
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,400
sometimes even in the

441
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,620
uh way of doing things too like I've

442
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,940
seen that too we can talk about it but

443
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,980
yeah I think empathy is extremely

444
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,299
important for being any sort of leader

445
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,640
so yeah I think that also makes your

446
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,500
partner see you as more human and not

447
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,000
like just someone who's going to come

448
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
with a list of you know things for them

449
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,260
to do and like orders to execute on but

450
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,179
someone who will work with them together

451
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:50,460
for what's better for the business and

452
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,039
security is a part of that

453
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,559
yeah I think uh I liked what you were

454
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,179
saying Katie about kind of risk and

455
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,860
prioritization because I think some of

456
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,820
the

457
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,400
one of the biggest things that I feel

458
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,320
more prepared for because of some of the

459
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,600
prior things that I've done is that

460
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,280
you know you don't have unlimited

461
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,660
resources you don't have unlimited

462
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,980
people to solve all of the security

463
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,179
problems even though that would be

464
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,559
lovely

465
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,539
um which ones do you pick why do you

466
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,580
pick them and then how do you bump that

467
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,380
up against all of the other priorities

468
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,240
that your company has going on like new

469
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,100
products are launching or you know

470
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,200
there's a huge uh implementation that's

471
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,419
going on like those same people need to

472
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,400
help do security at your company how do

473
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,500
you convince them to spend time on the

474
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,000
things that need to be prioritized and

475
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,160
so having that like going through that

476
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,480
process and talking through that like

477
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,980
any kind of projects or any kind of

478
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,600
initiatives where you can get involved

479
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,580
in those kind of discussions I think

480
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,980
would be super helpful and explain to

481
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,360
the customer why you made that priority

482
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,160
and then yeah like interesting 100

483
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,140
explaining to the customer why you made

484
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,820
that priority why did you fix that CV

485
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,860
well I was writing with a feature that

486
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,480
you want us to do it right there's no

487
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,000
exploitability of that CB right so it's

488
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,340
your own like compost manner you talk to

489
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,860
them and that actually builds Trust

490
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,440
did you all feel that you know you

491
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,240
talked about skill sets that want to

492
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,860
develop did you have them when you

493
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,720
jumped into the Seesaw role or did you

494
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,559
feel

495
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,440
that was there something where you were

496
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,539
like holy like I you know I I don't

497
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,400
know how to do this and how did you cope

498
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,260
with that and how did you develop that

499
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,679
skill set

500
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,360
I think you go into your first company

501
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,820
with a plan in mind and they always say

502
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,679
like no plan survives contact with the

503
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,360
Enemy like you get there and everything

504
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,340
immediately changes

505
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,280
um I think for me I had always kind of

506
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,380
you know not put a lot of stock in

507
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,500
compliance it wasn't my favorite thing

508
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,299
uh and then it's a lot of what I do now

509
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,299
is compliance ISO sock 2 fedramp all at

510
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:47,520
the same time it's really exciting

511
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,380
um but you also learned that like in a

512
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,660
small company

513
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,299
those compliance objectives are very

514
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,860
very meaningful like they'll let you

515
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,179
close a deal that you couldn't deal

516
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,440
which might mean the difference between

517
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,179
keeping somebody or firing somebody

518
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,700
because you know all the VC money drives

519
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,960
up and suddenly you're worried about

520
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,900
margins so suddenly the the actions that

521
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,460
you take have a very real profound

522
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,140
impact and I think that was very very

523
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,660
different I didn't expect that as much

524
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,299
and any tips to cope with that or

525
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,940
you just try your best

526
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,380
I think

527
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,360
um there's just going to be so much you

528
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,280
don't know you bring into it a certain

529
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,720
skill set you know if you're in a more

530
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,760
narrow job in a larger company for

531
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,160
example like I was you come in as a CSO

532
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,539
and you have to do everything and you

533
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,039
have to make the decision on everything

534
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,260
and so having a network of people like

535
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,059
people at this table or like slack

536
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,220
channels dedicated to csos that has been

537
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,960
the place where I go a lot to ask a lot

538
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,340
of questions and get a lot of help

539
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,200
because you need a community of people

540
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,520
who can teach you some of these things

541
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,840
that you never got an opportunity to

542
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,559
learn

543
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,900
and I think on the front of those skill

544
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,220
sets too I think it can be really

545
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,559
overwhelming to think

546
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,600
oh well I have to have all of these

547
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,299
skill sets you actually just have to be

548
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,179
able to build a team that has all of

549
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,240
those skill sets uh and I think on the

550
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,299
the uh point of you know building your

551
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,820
network of people who are supporting you

552
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,840
um a lot of my team at attentive is

553
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,240
people that I have worked with before

554
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,740
and attentive is so much better for

555
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,460
having those really exceptional people

556
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,919
on that team

557
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,919
um and so you know it's it's really

558
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,500
investing in hiring people whether

559
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,840
that's just you know being

560
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,000
I get it's so many people don't take the

561
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,860
recruiting and interview process

562
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,919
seriously like that is so much of our

563
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,120
job is really killing it with recruiting

564
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,860
um and also just you know but like

565
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,600
you're here so you're you're already

566
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,059
building your network of security people

567
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,640
but if you move into this type of

568
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,200
management role

569
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,120
like a crazy amount of your job is

570
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,380
trying to get all of the best people

571
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,299
you've ever worked with before to work

572
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,700
with you again so all of the networking

573
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,159
you're doing now becomes extremely

574
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:07,260
helpful right you're only as good as

575
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,539
your team yes yeah because there's none

576
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,400
of us couldn't do all of the things we

577
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,440
have to be able to hire people who can

578
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,340
fill in those gaps

579
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,120
um I think certain skills that maybe not

580
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,559
skills but maybe experience that I

581
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,880
didn't have is

582
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,640
um talking to customers that that I

583
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,380
never did it I was always

584
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,419
hidden under some pile that you should

585
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,000
never talk to the customer which

586
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,559
baby good for a good reason I don't know

587
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,500
uh but uh uh that was interesting

588
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,000
because

589
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,220
um you're kind of especially on security

590
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,080
front sometimes functionality product in

591
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,760
smaller companies you're at the

592
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,559
Forefront of um

593
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,000
kind of like where the friction's on

594
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,100
where customers like why but what I

595
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,740
wanted this and you I got this right and

596
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,140
then um that that part is it was it's

597
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,780
interesting also uh something really

598
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,880
cool that I've seen that I never ever

599
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,559
thought of it is that

600
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,600
you give confidence to some people who

601
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,039
are going to use your product that's

602
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,960
that's okay yeah

603
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,400
that guy knows what he's talking about I

604
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,900
think they're doing the right thing and

605
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,460
then um that's that's how you start

606
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,900
building the trust right trust is the

607
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,820
most important thing especially with

608
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,120
data on the data field right and then uh

609
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,480
that that kind of was missing for me and

610
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,600
then uh compliance was 25 years of my

611
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,159
life after a professional life I'm like

612
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,100
I don't want compliance and then um and

613
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,220
then I I had to and

614
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,780
um and I killed it

615
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,440
but uh but uh I got sucked too take two

616
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,120
I saw twenty seven thousand miles please

617
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,280
compliance hip-hop

618
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,280
um but uh but uh what I learned is that

619
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,880
without these on the table it doesn't

620
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,799
even start right so the business doesn't

621
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,659
even start so that's that's a huge

622
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,580
impact to the business by by the virtue

623
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,860
of you know getting these compliance

624
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,780
certifications and I'm a firm believer

625
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,700
of if you're security or compliant

626
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,960
you're if you're a company you might not

627
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,940
be secure right um

628
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,679
once you focus on security you're only

629
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,860
like a 90 there right and the other one

630
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,780
is mapping mapping those controls to

631
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,280
what what they require in the company

632
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,260
side yeah the the

633
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,260
um what you brought up about the uh

634
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,179
customer calls and I would say also

635
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,700
calls with Auditors too yeah that it is

636
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,880
such a specific song and dance like it

637
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,179
is its own like if you if you're an

638
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,440
application security engineer and it's

639
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,240
like well I don't take random calls with

640
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,360
customers just and you want to move into

641
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,220
a role where you you would be more

642
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,080
customer facing just Shadow some of

643
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,580
those calls because it is just really

644
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,280
there is a certain language of saying I

645
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,720
don't know the answer to that let me go

646
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,220
figure it out and get back to you and

647
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,320
like being smooth and confident about

648
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,960
that that is just like really great to

649
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,240
have under your belts yeah we used to

650
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,980
get the compliance team at twilio used

651
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,799
to give like how to talk to an auditor

652
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,179
briefings before an audit and they would

653
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,620
bring in like all the engineers that

654
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,059
needed to do it because it is a specific

655
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,159
language and if you don't know it you

656
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,840
like all of a sudden you all these like

657
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,580
unnecessary things that are on your

658
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,780
audit reports that go to your customer

659
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,039
and then you have to explain it to them

660
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,200
too which is kind of like a double

661
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,700
whammy for I think what you were talking

662
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,500
about I'm right terrible

663
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,299
you don't want to explain your your

664
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,820
audit missings like what you missed in

665
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,380
the audit you don't want to explain that

666
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,840
to your customers yeah it's some really

667
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,240
great tips there on how to prepare you

668
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,760
know what to watch out for

669
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,200
um

670
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,659
moving on from just like preparing for

671
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:31,679
the role

672
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,039
when you start to receive offers uh for

673
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,320
head of security or CSO rules

674
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,179
what are some things that one should

675
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,919
watch out for like are there any due

676
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,380
diligence

677
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,640
items like for example I always think

678
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,360
about the orc structure like you know

679
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,020
should the role only report to head of

680
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,460
engineering or would it be okay to

681
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,799
report to CFO uh you know how do you

682
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,299
think about that and you know due

683
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:58,799
diligence in general like what would you

684
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,320
think about before accepting an offer

685
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,760
I think

686
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,240
um you know they're like obviously the

687
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,620
regular due diligence for any role like

688
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,779
what kind of company is it do you like

689
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,640
the product do you are do you care about

690
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,799
securing the product

691
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:16,980
um is for smaller companies is the the

692
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,480
company in a place where they can

693
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,559
continue paying your paycheck

694
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,020
financially those I think are kind of

695
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,140
table Stakes I would say the biggest uh

696
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,659
the biggest thing I was looking for in

697
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:29,820
my role and I think this is common

698
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,640
across many leadership positions is

699
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,880
is leadership committed to making the

700
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,740
security program successful and that can

701
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,799
be that can come across in a few

702
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,720
different ways do they have money to put

703
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,400
into the program will they let you hire

704
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,960
the right people

705
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,120
um and do they care like will they put

706
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,279
their own necks out to like make sure

707
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,840
that you're successful because it's not

708
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,419
just you it's it's commitment across the

709
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,460
board and so that's the number one thing

710
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,600
that I think is important when looking

711
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,260
for a role

712
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,120
I would say also you know choosing your

713
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,279
first CSO role that's that's your moment

714
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,380
to be really really selfish because in

715
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,360
theory you're going to want a second see

716
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,919
so well maybe you won't but you do you

717
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,380
want a second CSO role and so you're

718
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,419
gonna have to pick a company where you

719
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,000
can survive for two years you have the

720
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,620
correct authority to actually get stuff

721
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,260
done that you can show for when you go

722
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,260
on to the next company and there are a

723
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,460
lot of I don't know I would call them

724
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,100
maybe like traps out there where they

725
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,440
say it's a CSO role but it's just going

726
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,080
to be you by yourself forever with a

727
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,460
mountain of tech debt that you can never

728
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,740
solve and that's just it sucks for them

729
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,240
but it's not good for your career to

730
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,159
kind of go into that so looking for a

731
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,900
company where you can get alignment with

732
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,980
a boss

733
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,440
around resourcing and like what the plan

734
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,299
is because you know if you talk to your

735
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,159
boss and you're like you know I think

736
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,840
this needs to be a six-person team in

737
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,220
the first year and he's like whoa whoa

738
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,600
whoa like it's just you there's no money

739
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,059
for anything else that's a red flag but

740
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,679
he may say well I was thinking more like

741
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,600
four and maybe that's fine you know you

742
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,940
can come to an agreement like that

743
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,000
um

744
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,260
um Katie I'm sure you have a lot to say

745
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,419
about

746
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,220
um I do I love the org structure

747
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,179
question because I know we have

748
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:15,720
different opinions about this I I have

749
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,900
to be reporting into I need to be in the

750
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,340
same place as engineering so I report

751
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,500
into a CTO

752
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,980
um and I have reported all over the

753
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,720
place like

754
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,520
Co

755
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,940
CFO

756
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,820
guy that was a founder and also ran a

757
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,740
research team like where can we put

758
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,020
security decks and I just think they're

759
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,000
even these are all

760
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,980
competent leaders

761
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,440
the issue for me when I've been anywhere

762
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,260
other than engineering is not feeling

763
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,840
like our team was really part of the

764
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,059
engineering team and

765
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,640
consequently feeling like

766
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,460
our winds are each other's you know my

767
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,100
wins are your wins your wins are my wins

768
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,620
um we really you know we are in

769
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,059
engineering all hands together we go to

770
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:07,799
the engineering off site together and

771
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,159
that sort of collaboration

772
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:12,779
um and like the just the relationship

773
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:14,460
building with those teams that you get

774
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,559
organically if that's where your org

775
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,620
sits is incredibly helpful to me because

776
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,419
obviously we work with all different and

777
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,340
I'm at a SAS company

778
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,080
um so it might be SAS company specific

779
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,340
but you know we work with all different

780
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,899
teams but I don't have a lot of it's

781
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:33,360
just much less complicated projects that

782
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,580
we do with essentially any other team

783
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,340
and having the buy-in from other

784
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,799
engineers and you know the level of

785
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,779
comfort to go back and forth

786
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,419
they want to do something we are like

787
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,940
hey that's a little bit janky maybe we

788
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,559
could switch it up and do it in this

789
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,640
slightly more secure way and they're

790
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,260
like oh well that would actually screw

791
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,640
me up a little bit what if we did you

792
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,320
know like that back and forth until you

793
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,059
get to the perfect solution it's really

794
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:58,980
hard to do that without a rapport so

795
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,960
that's why I like

796
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,980
to make kiss kiss engineering security

797
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,440
does anyone else they would be able to

798
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,840
work with anyone that's not an

799
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,760
engineering like report to anyone else

800
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,679
and still be successful

801
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,539
don't everyone look at me because Katie

802
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:18,020
and I were discussing this before this

803
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,640
also I would love to hear an org

804
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,960
discussion with the kiss kiss

805
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,320
um okay here are my thoughts on this

806
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,880
particular topic so my the teams that

807
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,279
I've been on before have also reported

808
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,620
to like a whole host of places it's it's

809
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,679
been engineering it's been legal it's

810
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,000
been

811
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,799
um

812
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,020
Finance I've reported security teams

813
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,480
into the the CEO before

814
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,340
um I think the most important thing I

815
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,020
think Ideal World right you you do

816
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,360
report into engineering and the

817
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,340
engineering leader is super supportive

818
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,100
of the Security Org I think if you don't

819
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,020
have that second part it can be a

820
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,360
nightmare and so like my preference is

821
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,760
whoever is most willing to throw support

822
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,440
behind the Security Org to get things

823
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,059
done is where

824
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,399
potentially the best place for security

825
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,020
is because I think that you can also

826
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,640
have those a lot of those amazing

827
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,960
relationships with engineering go to

828
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,000
engineering all hands like be part of

829
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,720
their off-sites their fun activities

830
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,179
um do kiss kiss yeah

831
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,299
um

832
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,039
it's gone

833
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,360
I think that you can have a lot of that

834
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,460
without being in the engine it's

835
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,340
obviously way easier if if you're

836
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,200
um in Oregon and reporting to the same

837
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,520
person and whatnot but I've also seen

838
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,799
that go incredibly poorly and so I have

839
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,360
like a slightly different take on on

840
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,159
just like level of support being the

841
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,399
number one thing I I think it depends

842
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,799
the answer is it depends just like many

843
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:51,659
answers and security

844
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,220
um

845
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,860
technology or manufacturing right I mean

846
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,539
that that also depends like you can be a

847
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,179
ciso for manufacturing and or or

848
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:01,679
financial organization where you're

849
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,299
heavily regulated and you're under Chief

850
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:06,360
risk officer it kind of depends I like

851
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,360
being under engineering because we I'm

852
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,039
an engineer at the end of the day and

853
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,200
then I can speak the language and I can

854
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,360
like I said let's go back to it I can

855
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,399
build empathy right because this guy has

856
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,679
to write this code for eight hours uh

857
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,120
maybe he's not gonna sleep tonight right

858
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,419
and then um uh I think

859
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,340
I think it depends it really depends um

860
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,260
I like

861
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,140
CFOs a lot that's weird but because

862
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,880
they're they're kind of like that's

863
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,799
super weird because that they kind of

864
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,460
are the the mosque the most risk aware

865
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,380
people are in a company

866
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,779
and then uh since our job is risk and

867
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,820
Trust I think uh that's also an

868
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,980
interesting uh combination where

869
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,320
uh you might you might think of it too I

870
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,179
like so far being under engineering

871
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,159
because we play this game that has been

872
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,440
occasions where

873
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,100
um

874
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,440
segregation of Duties right I mean like

875
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,220
um

876
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,679
they ruled me out because it was a more

877
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,179
important thing for engineering which is

878
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,820
I'm like okay great I mean uh I don't

879
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,740
take it personally but here's the risk

880
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,840
you sign off on that risk but go our

881
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,179
ways and we're fine right so uh

882
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:13,799
sometimes I've seen I've seen it

883
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,179
happening that uh you know engineering

884
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,240
wins all the time but hey somebody's

885
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,140
giving

886
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,760
I think the other part of this question

887
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,380
is something you need to touch on which

888
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,360
is when you're taking that role what

889
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,620
should you be looking for to set

890
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,539
yourself up for Success because you he

891
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,039
told me about some things that I

892
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,419
probably should have asked about being

893
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:33,539
in my contract I just simply did it that

894
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:36,140
was gonna be like speaking of risk

895
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,880
what can you what should you have in

896
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,860
your contract to protect yourself from

897
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,860
you know liability or you know have the

898
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,360
titles that you want like how do you

899
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,580
negotiate that and

900
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,460
about things like you know double

901
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,820
trigger and you know compensation in

902
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,760
case of termination

903
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,260
uh yeah how should you think think about

904
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,419
the contract so I'm very lucky to have

905
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:03,120
some some really strong CSO mentors who

906
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,440
who've helped me through this this

907
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,760
period

908
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,200
um and I think that the most important

909
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,060
thing I learned is everything is

910
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,639
negotiable everything is negotiable your

911
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,918
title your salary your options the

912
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,418
things in your contract to protect you

913
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:18,179
they can all be shifted to end up with

914
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,520
an offer that best suits you so you

915
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,520
there's probably three things that every

916
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,560
CSO wants in their contract and there's

917
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,119
a first time ciso you probably aren't

918
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,739
going to get all of them there's the

919
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:31,560
double trigger which is change of

920
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,560
control change of scope so like if your

921
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,139
company gets Acquired and you're not

922
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,239
going to get a CSO job in the acquired

923
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,918
company that activates your double

924
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,020
trigger and accelerates your options so

925
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,339
you can potentially go somewhere else

926
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,560
and not lose out on you know the payout

927
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,320
uh there is golden parachute which is

928
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,000
that they fire you they have to do it in

929
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,379
a certain way for a certain amount of

930
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:54,540
money which can really protect you in

931
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,879
very risky companies you know if you

932
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,380
know you're taking a big risk there's a

933
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,240
lot of tech dangerous Tech debt getting

934
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,800
golden parachute

935
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,320
um is important and then uh directors

936
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,599
and officers Insurance

937
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,700
um not every CSO is a director of the

938
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,920
company but you can get specifically

939
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,900
named on the insurance policy and that's

940
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,240
really important if you get personally

941
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,820
sued for something that happened at the

942
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,099
company uh the dno insurance will

943
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,540
protect you and provide you legal

944
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,040
coverage

945
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,960
um I'd be curious for everyone I

946
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,339
personally I got a double trigger but

947
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:27,420
nothing else

948
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,339
I can't emphasize enough how much I

949
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:31,020
didn't know any of these things existed

950
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,260
before taking this role so I said

951
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,359
I know who's going to be my next advisor

952
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:37,920
for my next role

953
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,339
and no parachutes I just like free

954
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,920
falling so yeah see Kyle if you could um

955
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,720
provide your information to be all of

956
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,579
our age yeah my services available I

957
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,099
will help uh yeah these were things that

958
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:51,960
I was vaguely aware that were out in the

959
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,579
world but because I was not when I

960
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:54,780
actually interviewed it was for a head

961
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,180
of GRC role it wasn't necessarily

962
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,339
something that was as applicable

963
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:00,900
um and if I had interviewed as a head of

964
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,160
security I probably would have looked

965
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,140
slightly into

966
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,700
um but yeah definitely something to to

967
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,800
keep in mind for next time

968
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,960
and did you negotiate for all the other

969
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,400
things and didn't get them or did you

970
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,740
not know about them yeah I tried I think

971
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,960
at the time our my company was a little

972
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,240
immature so like the the dno thing they

973
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,800
were just like we don't we don't we

974
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,839
don't know how to do that so no you know

975
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,480
so so that's one I've still been working

976
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,400
on like two years later I think I'm

977
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,320
about to get on the dno policy so I'm

978
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,000
excited about that

979
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,160
um I think you also mentioned title I

980
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,839
think title is one of the most critical

981
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,180
things you can negotiate like when we

982
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,400
submitted the cfp one of the pieces of

983
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,780
feedback we got from The Proposal was

984
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,060
well there's only one CSO in this panel

985
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,619
about sea cells like what's with that

986
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,900
it's me

987
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,740
yeah

988
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,900
and I think there's a conflation in our

989
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,079
industry about like there's the title

990
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,119
ciso which is like a c-level executive

991
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:56,280
and then there's the role of ciso which

992
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,260
is like named in compliance documents

993
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,619
and you know diligence and that role of

994
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,900
CSO doesn't always have the title of CSO

995
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,000
and some people who get the title ciso

996
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,680
don't always have the role of actually

997
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,420
owning security at the company so you

998
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,920
got to make sure you're getting I think

999
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,960
the first time you want the role of CSO

1000
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,940
more than you necessarily need the title

1001
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,040
of CSO so that's why I negotiated for

1002
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,599
head of security I think MRI you

1003
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,280
negotiate for head of security they just

1004
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,220
give it to me so uh if you can get sea

1005
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,260
so great but I think there are other

1006
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,180
very if you get CSO that probably you

1007
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,099
know you can't negotiate I can't come in

1008
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:30,900
and be like I want everything you have

1009
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,119
to pick the thing or can you that you

1010
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,480
yeah that you want and um I I mean I

1011
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,460
remember when I was like okay I kind of

1012
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,740
I mean it look it's so stupid like

1013
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,720
obviously all of us have the same job

1014
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,560
and security people know that I honestly

1015
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,960
at the time I was applying to Executive

1016
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,599
MBA programs and I was like having a CSO

1017
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,300
title is gonna help my application to

1018
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,460
get into one of the top schools that I

1019
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,900
want to go to

1020
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,180
um so that's why that was important to

1021
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,660
me at the time but for other people I

1022
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,520
mean I'm sure for most people it's like

1023
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,320
oh if I pick one thing to negotiate on

1024
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,380
am I gonna have a fancier title on

1025
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,480
LinkedIn or am I gonna get more money

1026
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,980
like

1027
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,940
probably more people I mean

1028
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,500
yeah if I wasn't in that very specific

1029
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,020
situation I would have preferred the

1030
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,720
latter I think there's also oh no I'm

1031
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,859
Gonna Change like slightly you change

1032
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:28,800
the topic so you go first so I I think I

1033
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,079
couldn't emphasize more I think

1034
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:35,040
uh head of security and compliance most

1035
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,960
of the time does exactly the same job as

1036
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,900
a seesaw or whatever title VP of

1037
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,180
security or something like that and the

1038
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,700
the quality of the work is pretty much

1039
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,740
the same the quantity of the work might

1040
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,500
be even higher than CSO but uh but uh

1041
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,079
she's so tired till always wins

1042
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,579
all right that's that's that's an

1043
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,740
interesting one because there might be

1044
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,560
seesaws who are work like doing less

1045
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,500
work getting paid less but if they want

1046
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,540
to get another so much less work there

1047
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,900
you go some of us do but I mean like it

1048
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,300
might be it might be uh you'll put your

1049
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,520
next role it might you might be on top

1050
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,339
of the funnel right that that's

1051
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:16,079
interesting and in your first role too

1052
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,079
like I think you made the point of you

1053
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,700
should it's early on in your career you

1054
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,960
should always be making the decisions

1055
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,599
that are maximizing your learning so if

1056
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,599
if you are have a CSO title at one of

1057
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,619
those companies that you were describing

1058
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,540
where it's like okay we're giving you no

1059
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,000
resources your job is basically to like

1060
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,619
sit at this desk with an enormous amount

1061
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:38,040
of tech debt that is not that's not it

1062
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,480
um it's much better throw in like a

1063
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,700
marketing CSO yes like if you're like a

1064
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,800
sales focused CSO that's also a

1065
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,839
different role a very like important one

1066
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,339
and one that I don't want to do so thank

1067
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:49,260
you for those people who do do it um but

1068
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,960
it's a different type of CSO role with

1069
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,500
see so title yeah that's true

1070
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,780
so what was the topic that you were

1071
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,859
gonna oh I was going to talk about

1072
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,140
marketing so I just put I pushed it in

1073
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,460
right there okay

1074
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,800
um talking about making a ton of money

1075
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,599
are y'all making a ton more money than

1076
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,280
you did before

1077
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,260
yes

1078
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,140
no

1079
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,760
really actually I think also a big uh

1080
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,520
our company is I think one of the

1081
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,680
biggest differences too is

1082
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,359
um equity and I I have rsus at a company

1083
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,720
that is uh private and they are nothing

1084
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,540
unless we unless we have a liquidation

1085
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,060
event so um so the the answer is

1086
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,780
actually uh like not so much but

1087
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,760
I'm it's also I mean all of us are first

1088
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,700
time Jesus you know yeah is it is it

1089
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,579
first thing so if you land in a post IPO

1090
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,680
company Kudos right that's great and

1091
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,020
then um kind of the answer is kind of

1092
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,640
related to that because we play with the

1093
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,400
Monopoly money right and then uh

1094
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,099
the the post IPO is real money and then

1095
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,680
if you go from a real money company to

1096
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,240
it doesn't matter the title or whatever

1097
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,599
if you go from one that has actual money

1098
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,400
and then the other to the Monopoly money

1099
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,220
you make less money period because you a

1100
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,320
good chunk of your uh income is actually

1101
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,920
that money and then uh but the other

1102
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,020
interesting part is that since now

1103
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,940
you're tied to make that Monopoly money

1104
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,339
real money you work your ass off to

1105
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:26,520
actually make it happen so that's where

1106
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,660
and one of the things that if you're

1107
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,640
gonna sell the software or SAS or

1108
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,680
whatever trust is one of the most

1109
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,000
important things right and then that's

1110
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,320
where that's where you actually double

1111
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,260
your work your ass off because now you

1112
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,839
want actual money so yeah and the answer

1113
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,260
is uh I make less money yeah

1114
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,420
and

1115
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,220
that's also the most fun time to be at

1116
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,200
the company because I think everyone has

1117
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,579
the same goal yeah is it of you know

1118
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:55,500
let's let's be successful and you know

1119
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,560
yeah have a liquidation event four small

1120
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,020
companies uh so when I joined ngrac we

1121
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,240
were pre-series a and it was a

1122
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,339
bootstrapped startup uh and I had a

1123
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,960
really really hard time just figuring

1124
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,480
out what I should be getting paid and so

1125
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,579
I would come to the table with like

1126
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,740
here's what I used to get paid can you

1127
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,079
figure out what that means from because

1128
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,180
I was at a public company prior I was

1129
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,880
going to a essentially a bootstrap

1130
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,400
startup that had maybe funding dreams in

1131
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,900
the future

1132
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,940
um and so this was actually something

1133
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,220
that like my a lot of my mentors helped

1134
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,200
me figure out and like hooked me up with

1135
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,760
like different people around you know

1136
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,980
how do I value startup funding you can

1137
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,480
read every article on the internet but

1138
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,180
none of them and if you know of any

1139
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,280
please email them to me

1140
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,780
um none of them really talk about what

1141
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,339
you should be getting paid as a security

1142
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:50,220
leader at a 30 person company that

1143
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,859
hasn't taken funding yet and so that was

1144
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:54,240
actually really really hard for me so I

1145
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,980
think that I'm making

1146
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,680
an equivalent amount that I was before

1147
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,440
so I definitely didn't get a pay raise

1148
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,400
um but it's definitely a different type

1149
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,380
of role in a different type of company I

1150
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,640
think it's also the same thing that's

1151
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,640
true for any job which is I am making

1152
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,319
more money because I left my old company

1153
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,940
a bunch of a new company like that's

1154
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,900
that's when the big I I was at one

1155
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,560
company for a really long chunk of my

1156
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,240
career and I think any time you do that

1157
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,599
it just kind of ends up you know your

1158
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:25,980
salary doesn't really

1159
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,319
keep if you work at the company that I

1160
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,480
work at I ignore everything I just said

1161
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,579
but if you

1162
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:35,540
so

1163
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:38,280
questions

1164
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,660
um a quick you know one sentence

1165
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,960
um impact like what impact or what is

1166
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,060
the biggest achievement you each of you

1167
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,119
have had at your company so far

1168
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,579
I'm about three weeks away from fedramp

1169
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:56,640
moderate and so for me I'm very very

1170
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,520
excited about that that's pretty wild

1171
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,180
um we're doing a big cross-functional

1172
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,740
engineering project that requires work

1173
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:08,040
from every single engineering team and

1174
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,400
it just requires so much

1175
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,140
buy-in and participation and effort

1176
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,599
across all of engineering and and what's

1177
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,460
meaningful about that to me I mean it

1178
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,500
will improve our security posture but

1179
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,420
just that requires buy-in from

1180
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,220
leadership across engineering and that's

1181
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,099
like gorgeous

1182
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:28,280
foreign

1183
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:36,119
but like I I'm actually super happy when

1184
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:37,500
I have an impact

1185
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,599
um I have impact bigger than security

1186
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,880
right now in my uh in my company like

1187
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,220
started engineering bootcamp started a

1188
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,560
bunch of different uh interesting um

1189
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,940
uh interactive uh things to to make to

1190
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,800
make people actually know each other Etc

1191
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,839
to make it work

1192
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:57,960
um I think uh my my biggest impact that

1193
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,480
my my gauge of impact is actually when I

1194
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,400
talk to the customers and when when I

1195
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,680
got like a Stern face and it's like so

1196
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,119
tell me about your security how do you

1197
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,740
do this and then at the end of the

1198
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,780
meeting they're like cool I like that

1199
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,880
yeah nice and and then that's that's

1200
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,500
that's huge impact right there because

1201
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,720
that's gonna transfer as a word of mouth

1202
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,940
right to to their peers and their

1203
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,800
colleagues and their other companies Etc

1204
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,480
that's that's kind of my impact gauge

1205
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,839
right there

1206
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,980
I think the biggest

1207
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:30,300
I've noticed so we've gotten feedback a

1208
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,560
couple of times from our engineering or

1209
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,200
that the security team and this is you

1210
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,180
know it's two of us so it's not really

1211
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,040
uh take this for the greatest show but

1212
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,660
the security team is really easy to work

1213
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,760
with and I think that's like you can't

1214
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,200
get anything done if people don't want

1215
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,760
to work with you and so that for me is

1216
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,460
like the biggest thing thus far and and

1217
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,599
hopefully the biggest thing in the

1218
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:49,440
future

1219
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,599
being able to build a culture where

1220
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,540
everyone's on board security yeah so

1221
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,040
it's easy to build something for just

1222
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,359
the security team to use but it's really

1223
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,400
hard to build processes and tooling that

1224
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,099
other people like to use as well true

1225
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,079
awesome all right I think we're ready

1226
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,500
for questions

1227
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,880
okay the question was what percentage of

1228
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,839
your time is spent doing people

1229
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,079
management of your direct reports

1230
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,920
I only have one so very little

1231
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,220
[Laughter]

1232
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,859
uh we also pretty lean uh security team

1233
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:27,780
and then uh

1234
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,819
um what do you when you say people

1235
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:30,839
management

1236
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:34,440
um if it's prioritizing work I think

1237
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,319
um you got to minimize that by hiring

1238
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:38,760
like someone who's a better self

1239
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,119
motivated at this stage of your team

1240
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:44,460
um driving their career is a constant

1241
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,740
thing I would say at least 10 to 20

1242
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,660
percent of my time to be honest yeah

1243
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,640
I think one of the terms I really loved

1244
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,619
when I was interviewing uh was the term

1245
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:54,720
player coach you kind of sell yourself

1246
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,460
for these roles is like I can be

1247
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,680
Hands-On but also grow and scale a team

1248
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,500
at the same time so there is you know 50

1249
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,060
or more of it is probably going to be

1250
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,099
Hands-On until you actually scale that

1251
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:06,900
team up

1252
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,900
yeah and I think in addition to

1253
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,020
um I mentioned this before but in

1254
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,339
addition to

1255
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:17,220
um you know one-on-ones and making sure

1256
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,140
that their goals are clear for your

1257
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,839
directs a lot of my I was the first

1258
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,700
Security hire

1259
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,980
um and now it is part of our team as

1260
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,099
well a lot of the last year has been

1261
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,119
spent

1262
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,000
finding and coaching up the right

1263
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,760
leaders of that team especially in I.T

1264
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,560
because I have not run an I.T team

1265
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,140
before so I needed to really find

1266
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,579
someone who could independently lead

1267
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:43,260
that function and that was

1268
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,280
I mean I have I was spending two and a

1269
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,660
half hours in interviews every single

1270
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,760
day and just ending the day like an

1271
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,480
absolute corpse

1272
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,900
yes please go ahead

1273
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,000
do you report to the board yes yes and

1274
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,400
what does it look like

1275
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,079
um I report to an audit committee

1276
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,260
quarterly which is a subset of the board

1277
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,180
um and that's been true other places

1278
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,680
that I've worked as well the audit

1279
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,440
committee is focused on like accounting

1280
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,280
stuff

1281
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,520
um but increasingly it and and security

1282
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,440
and internal audit are reporting there

1283
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,859
the approach that I take is every single

1284
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:25,920
meeting I remind them this is why our

1285
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,579
security team exists like we meet our

1286
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:33,839
compliance requirements we uh build we

1287
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,000
are mitigating our known risks to a

1288
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,720
reasonable threshold and we are building

1289
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,700
resilience so that we can bounce back

1290
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,300
quickly from an incident and then I talk

1291
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,300
about this is what we have done over the

1292
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,599
last quarter to to move towards those

1293
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,160
outcomes and then this is what we're

1294
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,380
doing in in the next quarter I am super

1295
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,960
I have one board member who

1296
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,500
totally gets it and is so smart

1297
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,780
um I I really you know I think a lot of

1298
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,180
times it's just like I hope that nothing

1299
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,680
bad happens to me in this meeting I

1300
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,359
actually get a lot of value out of

1301
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,040
meeting with this board member I think

1302
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,560
that he's a genius

1303
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,660
yeah we uh right now we're a small

1304
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,460
company we also have a we have a very

1305
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,940
small board uh we report I report

1306
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,400
security as a part of the engineering

1307
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,020
update

1308
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,780
um in Prior roles where I've built out

1309
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,599
board reporting for my boss uh it's

1310
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:32,640
looked essentially like this oh like

1311
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,740
everybody has their own kind of formula

1312
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,240
but generally it's like what kind of

1313
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,440
current events are happening and how

1314
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,079
does that impact our company uh what

1315
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,880
kind of projects do we have going on and

1316
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,140
then usually there's some kind of like

1317
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,540
highlight reel of either something cool

1318
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,819
that's been going on or a problem that

1319
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:49,440
needs to be fixed or like a risk

1320
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,240
assessment readout something kind of

1321
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,720
like topical

1322
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,520
um I I personally do not report the uh

1323
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,260
to the board but I prepared a lot of uh

1324
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,960
metrics to the board

1325
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,720
is extremely interested in Risk and then

1326
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,300
when when cyber Security Professionals

1327
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,700
we think risk as cyber security risk but

1328
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,319
there are other risks not being able to

1329
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,819
fund it there's

1330
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:15,599
building fire risk Etc and then um at

1331
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,400
this point I I have a feeling that our

1332
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,619
company has like bigger risk fires that

1333
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:21,480
they're fighting and uh than cyber

1334
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,260
security

1335
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:26,700
and then um but it gets reported so yeah

1336
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,440
I think we have a question on this side

1337
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,280
right

1338
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:51,960
the number one thing that you did to

1339
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,619
build a network of mentors just be

1340
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,740
Shameless just ask for things that you

1341
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,839
feel so uncomfortable asking for because

1342
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:03,000
they're all super super busy and

1343
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,500
distracted by like a million different

1344
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,359
things but if you can be very specific

1345
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:08,339
like hey I'm not in a slack channel can

1346
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:10,079
you put me in a slack Channel they're

1347
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,819
like oh yeah that's really easy for me

1348
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,200
to do I didn't think about doing that

1349
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,420
for you but I'll do it now like just ask

1350
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,599
and it's not I mean on the receiving end

1351
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:20,280
of them it's funny how I feel so awkward

1352
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,599
asking other people for help and then

1353
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:22,680
someone asks me for help and I'm like

1354
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,559
yeah freaking no-brainer um okay I

1355
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:28,859
listened to a podcast about uh reporting

1356
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:31,079
risk to management and it was so amazing

1357
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:33,420
but the guy gave a high level overview

1358
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,680
of it I was like I want to do this but

1359
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,420
it's I'm missing some pieces of data

1360
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,980
like you know he didn't go into enough

1361
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,599
