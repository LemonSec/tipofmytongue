10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,220
aspirational title um but hopefully you

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,779
guys can get some value out of what I've

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,180
got to say I'm going to walk you through

13
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,640
some tips tricks and just organizational

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,399
things that I've seen as a career

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,800
security recruiter walking through you

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,559
know applying to jobs uh kind of that

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,360
ideation process as well determining

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,160
what you're looking for all the way up

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,559
to uh you know the first interview

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,160
um so yeah let's uh let's dive into it

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,260
um obviously the market uh you know is

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,539
is tougher now than it was last year and

23
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,579
when uh the market is a little bit more

24
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,199
competitive uh you definitely have to

25
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,239
take a strategic approach

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,000
um to you know your job search you can't

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,820
necessarily just um be spam applying you

28
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,299
must be very targeted um and directed uh

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,119
with your your applications and efforts

30
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,220
when you're you're looking for a role

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,020
um I like to think of it almost like a

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,880
pie or a cake where

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,119
um if one ingredient or one aspect of

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,979
um you know the the process of you know

35
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,140
this job search or making a cake in this

36
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,220
example

37
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,680
um isn't necessarily up to par

38
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,600
um then that can affect the the end

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,320
result

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,479
um pretty deeply so you really need to

41
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,400
you know look at all aspects uh

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,200
everything that goes into your

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,540
networking your application process your

44
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,340
resume your LinkedIn

45
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,920
um and uh you know really you know go

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,240
through each with kind of a fine tune

47
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,220
comb and make sure that uh it's

48
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,079
representing you to the best you you

49
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,479
know you're abilities

50
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,140
um so here is kind of my high level view

51
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,540
of you know getting to an application or

52
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,340
getting to an interview what questions

53
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,680
do I need to ask myself what do I need

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,060
to answer

55
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,680
um you know first what do you enjoy

56
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,479
doing what do you you know like about

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,300
your goal what do you want to do more of

58
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,220
um how do you present yourself that can

59
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,099
be your resume your LinkedIn your GitHub

60
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,540
um anything that's out there online for

61
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,040
people to find

62
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,540
um you know people are going to look at

63
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,000
it I know a lot of recruiters here that

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,340
have dug through besides archives or

65
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,500
black hat archives they've dug through

66
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,000
githubs and

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,140
um you know found some pretty

68
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,780
interesting ways to source so uh I'm

69
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,920
telling you right now if it's out there

70
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,900
we're probably going to find it so you

71
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,000
have to you know have some control over

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,459
you know your footprint online and then

73
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,739
lastly who do you know that can help a

74
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,019
lot of security right now is a very

75
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,459
tight-knit Circle

76
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:46,500
um the you know broader industry is

77
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,620
small but it's growing rapidly getting

78
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,920
that first step into security or even as

79
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,500
you're making a move in leadership uh

80
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,080
oftentimes you're going to know somebody

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,840
um that is going to be that key kind of

82
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,480
factor in getting a role referrals are

83
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,280
huge in the industry

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,900
um so really you know tapping into your

85
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,540
network is is huge as well

86
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,540
so diving into that a little bit deeper

87
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,280
um first really understanding where are

88
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,379
you at in your career what is the next

89
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:19,379
step forward and what's my end goal

90
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,840
um some questions to ask yourself uh

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,760
similar to reverse engineering work

92
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,140
backwards

93
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,879
um know what your end goal is if you

94
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,680
want to be a CSO one day how do you get

95
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,640
there

96
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,620
um even if you're you know just getting

97
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,260
into security you know have an end goal

98
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,540
in mind and be directional on you know

99
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,920
what you're looking for and what you

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,780
want

101
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,060
oftentimes I think we can get very broad

102
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,040
especially you know as you're really

103
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,980
trying to break into the industry

104
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,540
um where you may not necessarily know

105
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,920
explicitly what you want to do you just

106
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,019
know you want to work in security

107
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,940
um you know talk to people in the

108
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,120
industry talk to peers talk to leaders

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,819
um get an idea of you know what you

110
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,620
actually enjoy you know do you want to

111
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,200
be Hands-On coding Great learn more

112
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,480
about that represent that on your resume

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,879
you know contribute actively on GitHub

114
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,860
if you want to work more on the

115
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,239
compliance or the business side of

116
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,120
security as well you know Network and

117
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,519
learn from leaders who have done it as

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,459
well or peers and really you know

119
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,860
understand what impact do I want to have

120
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,259
uh what areas do I need to grow in what

121
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,880
do I want to learn

122
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,340
um and how do I progress towards my end

123
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,440
goal um always think about that that

124
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,020
pathway that road map throughout the the

125
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,040
process of applying and interviewing

126
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,380
number two control your footprint I kind

127
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,180
of touched on a little bit earlier

128
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,340
um but if it's online I guarantee we're

129
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,080
probably gonna we're gonna see it hiring

130
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,639
manager is going to see it

131
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,400
um so is it helping you or hindering you

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
that's the biggest question

133
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
it really breaks down to two things like

134
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,020
I touched on your online presence but

135
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,400
also your resume as well that's

136
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,960
typically kind of the first touch point

137
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,600
that people will see if you're applying

138
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,860
um you know through a standard

139
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,660
application process that resume is

140
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,540
really kind of the Gateway into who you

141
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,340
are in your career

142
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,780
Um this can include cover letters as

143
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,540
well uh I would say coverage letters are

144
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,240
kind of a thing of the past nowadays um

145
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,100
so yeah your resume and your online

146
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,560
presence sir are huge um in kind of this

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,080
part of the process

148
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,740
um here you really want to get your your

149
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,960
LinkedIn updated look around at the

150
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,180
industry look at peers who have been

151
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,380
successful

152
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,259
understand what makes their LinkedIn

153
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,340
presence or their engagement online work

154
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,840
a lot of times that's commenting on

155
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,440
posts you know engaging with communities

156
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,880
joining Discord groups or slack groups

157
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,400
slack channels attending virtual events

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,520
get your name associated with you know

159
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,199

160
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,180
focus in whether that's detection

161
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,020
engineering appsec infrasek you name it

162
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,360
make sure that if I go on my on your

163
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,759

164
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,100

165
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,380

168
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,199

181
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,639
you're trying to almost kind of fit a

182
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,319
square peg into a round hole if you're

183

189

hiring managers we can make

190
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,300
introductions even internally if you're

working through an internal Talent

193
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,199

194
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,960

195
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,940
way so definitely don't forget to reach

out to your your talent

197
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,160
your resume is like I mentioned quite

198
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,780
literally the the first thing that

199
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,919
people typically see through the

200
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,900
application process it's not going to be

201
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,340
the thing that gets you a job but it

202
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,500
very well could you know reject you on

203
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,599
so you really want to make sure that

204
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,099
you're being strategic and what you put

205
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,560
on your resume and that it's only giving

206
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,099
you strengths adding two you know your

207
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,199
skill set benefiting you and not

208
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,479
hindering in any way

209
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,880
some tips that I've seen throughout my

210
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,419
time as a recruiter keep it short

211
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:59,520
typically you know depending on the

212
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,979
recruiter an average resume review can

213
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,900
last anywhere between you know a couple

214
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,060
seconds to minutes

215
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,880
um I probably have yet to see anybody

216
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,319
actually review a resume for 10 minutes

217
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,000
that's pretty long

218
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,280
um but yeah at Max you know two pages or

219
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,380
so keep it short and sweet um and very

220
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,240
directional on you know what you want to

221
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,379
focus on

222
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,120
titles in summary

223
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,280
um underneath your name my suggestion is

224
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,440
to put the title that you're aspiring

225
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,500
aspiring to achieve whether you know

226
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,120
that's a security engineer security

227
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,880
analyst breaking into the industry or a

228
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,279
director of infosec who's looking to you

229
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,000
know get that first CSO um gig as well

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,440
put that under there that's what people

231
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,080
see when I look on on a resume or a

232
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,600
recruiter will look we subconsciously

233
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,760
associate that with

234
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,160
um your name and and you know who you

235
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,320
are so having that title under the

236
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,120
underneath even if it's not necessarily

237
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,160
what you're doing now but it's kind of

238
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,019
that next progression in your career

239
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,839
highlight that and let it be known

240
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,300
also experience matters not only from

241
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,160
what you've done

242
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,260
um what you haven't done but also how

243
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,880
you word it the order in which you order

244
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,920
on your resume these are all you know

245
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,140
things that can make an impact

246
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,600
um whether you you realize it or not

247
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,339
to dive a little deeper on the

248
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,820
experience part in general this is kind

249
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,860
of a lot to to look at but I think

250
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,779
there's really three main buckets when

251
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,120
looking uh at you know bullet points on

252
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,860
our resume can highlight you know

253
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,180
leadership skills whether that's

254
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,740
mentorship

255
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,060
um you know scope of projects that

256
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,260
you've worked on different business

257
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,760
impacts

258
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,500
um that's one bucket that can kind of

259
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,660
highlight your leadership abilities your

260
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,700
technical abilities your coding and

261
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,080
languages that you are comfortable

262
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,820
working with different projects or

263
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,120
products that you've developed those are

264
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,640
all great examples to bring in on

265
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,740
technical impacts of the work you've

266
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,019
done and behavioral as well is is

267
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,880
important to include

268
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,320
um just to show that you know you're a

269
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,300
problem solver you have communication

270
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,720
skills and soft skills work on it uh if

271
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,880
you know if there's any area that you

272
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,339
may feel that is lacking or that you're

273
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,820
strong in one and not as much another

274
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,140
generally if you have you know these

275
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,500
three broad skill sets it's going to uh

276
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,620
you know pretty appealing from a resume

277
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,060
reviewer or a hiring manager's

278
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,160
perspective

279
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,839
additionally start your bullet points

280
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,040
off with a verb when we're talking about

281
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,500
how to craft your experience explicitly

282
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,279
you know developed created built LED

283
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,720
architected designed that's what

284
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,860
recruiters want to see that's what

285
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,540
hiring managers want to see they want to

286
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,399
see the actionable things that you

287
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,399
incorporated or worked on at the company

288
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,740
keep your bullet points on each roll I

289
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,920
would say between three to five you

290
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,540
don't want to have a long list because

291
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,459
by the time you get Midway through the

292
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,680
bullets though you've already lost the

293
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,480
reader's attention and they're kind of

294
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,040
moving on to your your next step in your

295
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,740
career so keep it short and sweet

296
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,500
order matters as well in the the way

297
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,680
that the experience is worded you know

298
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,420
the first thing you see is the first

299
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,800
thing that

300
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,079
um you know you want to associate with

301
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,940
your role and also what your desired

302
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,980
role is moving forward so if you're a

it's very heavily working throughout the

306
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,019
sdlc and that's highlighted in the in

307
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,180
the job description look at what the

308
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,920
bullets they have there lists and their

309
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,500
requirements are and order that

310
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,820
similarly in your experience

311

results it you know gives a lot more

317
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,620
tangibility and

318
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,399

335
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,480
five pages they're really long and you

336
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,459
lose the the attention of the the reader

337
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,800
so keep it short keep it sweet and you

338
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,160
know keep it targeted to what you want

339
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,160
finally networking is is huge when

340
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,019
applying for a role when trying to find

341
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,760
a new job be directed and targeted in

342
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,740
what you're looking for

343
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,660
like I mentioned earlier to speak to

344
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,220
Talent professionals that's who I would

345
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,500
reach out to first first personally they

346
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,420
oftentimes can help you you know work

347
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,760
through the application process know who

348
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,320
to talk to within the company and

349
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,880
usually have a direct line to the hiring

350
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,839
managers

351
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,180
second reach out to peers ask for

352
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,120
referrals that's huge in the industry a

353
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,100
lot of companies have referral programs

354
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,200
in place to help them you know fill

355
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,060
roles everybody wants to have the best

356
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,519
team around and the fact that you know

357
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,339
you know people uh your network is is

358
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,680
very valuable even even just reaching

359
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,880
out to somebody that you may have never

360
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,680
actually worked with or know personally

361
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,899
but having a conversation a quick coffee

362
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,600
chat maybe a quick phone call and then

363
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,100
asking for a referral at the end of it

364
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,800
can uh definitely make a big impact

365
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,620
finally reach out to leaders like I

366
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,060
mentioned when reaching out to leaders

367
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,220
you want to make sure that you're

368
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,540
reaching out with empathy your

369
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,980
understanding of you know their schedule

370
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,620
if you get the time to chat with them go

371
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,260
in be attentive follow up and just go in

372
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,019
expecting to uh to learn

373
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:54,060
um obviously this is more applicable to

374
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,220
uh you know maybe people earlier on in

375
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,500
their career in the mid stages

376
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,420
um you know it can be more peers once

377
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,019
you uh progress to a certain point

378
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,240
lastly touching on networking tips that

379
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,320
I've seen

380
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,860
um

381
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,540
first of all you get 100 LinkedIn

382
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,420
connects per week I would suggest using

383
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,120
all of those I typically tend to max out

384
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,160
my connections but I also spend almost

385
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,920
on my day on LinkedIn so there's that

386
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,980
um but use interact build your network

387
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,560
um you know grow your your connections

388
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,540
make personal connections with people

389
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,940
ask for coffee chats

390
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,360
um interact on LinkedIn consistently

391
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,639
um you know comment on posts that you've

392
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,760
seen by leaders like things that have

393
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,459
popped up from company Pages interact

394
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:42,899
and respond to you know different

395
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:45,120
questions or posts that you've seen and

396
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,920
I would suggest posting at least you

397
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,500
know two times a week ideally in the

398
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,120
domain or subject area that you're

399
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
you're looking to focus in whether

400
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,660
that's you know any pillar with

401
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,079
insecurity associate your name with you

402
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,579
know your brand

403
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,680
um associate your name with the area of

404
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,120
security that you're you're looking to

405
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,000
uh to grow and expand in and be a

406
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,680
thought leader

407
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,360
building a brand kind of works its way

408
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,380
into that

409
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,839
um you know a lot of what is going to be

410
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,300
valuable for you are not necessarily

411
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,360
going to be you know your your resume

412
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,300
um and you know things that your resume

413
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,740
can only take you so far it's what I'm

414
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,720
trying to say your network is going to

415
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,339
be that key that takes it to the next

416
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,680
level when you ask for referrals

417
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,300
um and you have a brand that you've

418
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,399
built over time that's going to be the

419
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,959
most valuable thing

420
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,959
um really I think throughout this whole

421
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,519
presentation

422
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,959
um and then coffee chats as well it's an

423
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,120
easy way to have a you know informal

424
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,220
conversation learn more about you know

425
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,660
whether it's a company that you're

426
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,820
trying to apply for or a specific role

427
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,860
that somebody's doing maybe you're just

428
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,360
curious and want to have a conversation

429
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,040
with another security peer and ask

430
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,779
questions as well

431
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,399
um you know Network and build that

432
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,800
relationship with uh you know with the

433
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,079
broader security industry

434
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,300
now hopefully that will get you to

435
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,199
interview

436
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,240
um we can talk interviewing tips and

437
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,880
kind of where to go from there but

438
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,079
really you know making sure that your

439
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,000
resume is up to date your LinkedIn is up

440
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,320
to date

441
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,000
um it's packed full of things that are

442
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,519
helping you not hindering you and making

443
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,660
sure that you're tapping into your

444
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,459
network are really I think the three key

445
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,519
things to really take your infosec job

446
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,860
search to the next level so I'll kind of

447
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,600
open it up to questions now

448
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,459
um but I appreciate you taking some time

449
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:31,139
to listen to what I've got to say and

450
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,880
hopefully somebody uh you know took some

451
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,740
value out of it

452
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,700
foreign

453
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,809
[Applause]

454
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,680
where do you stand on like an objective

455
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,079
on a resume do you care do you read it

456
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,560
does it impact you at all uh I I as a

457
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,019
recruiter I do read it um I I like the

458
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,860
summary um at the top uh if you

459
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,420
some people will have multiple different

460
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,459
stages and you know an objective a

461
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,220
summary and kind of um a lot at the top

462
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,040
my suggestions would be you know keep it

463
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,140
to a couple sentences but be very

464
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,780
targeted uh on you know this is who I am

465
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,160
this is what I've done and this is what

466
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,199
I'm looking for but yeah I would

467
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,919
definitely keep it on there

468
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,660
hey uh thank you for the amazing talk uh

469
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,880
one question I had is how do you deal

470
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,700
with just you know applying to like

471
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,100
hundreds of jobs and not hearing bad

472
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,840
product rejections how do you you know

473
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,840
continue to push forward through it or

474
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,220
like just believe in yourself that you

475
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,600
know you're gonna get there at some

476
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,919
point so any tips for that or like yeah

477
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:44,820
yeah

478
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,679
um I mean it can be discouraging if

479
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,960
you're applying to hundreds of jobs and

480
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,520
you're not hearing back

481
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,020
not getting to the you know any

482
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,460
interviews

483
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,400
um it's really easy to to give up um at

484
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,900
that point and it's it's very

485
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,280
disheartening

486
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,960
um I would say that that Network piece

487
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,799
is probably going to be the biggest

488
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,600
thing it's just continue to have those

489
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,039
conversations with leaders and with

490
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,900
peers uh reach out to you know

491
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,400
recruiters as well and talent

492
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,840
individuals

493
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,940
um yeah me personally I'm always open to

494
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,919
have a chat to discuss how I can help

495
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,240
whether that's you know working through

496
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Linkedin uh working through your resume

497
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,100
um but I would say you know really

498
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,419
tapping into your network kind of

499
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,820
building that that awareness into the

500
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,740
industry is probably going to be you

501
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,820
know where you're going to find success

502
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,980
um I spoke to a recorder about

503
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,660
um when you're applying to send in a

504
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,460
resume and as well they also said they

505
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,860
preferred like a bio just to like talk

506
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,900
about a little bit more about who you

507
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,400
were like what are your what is your

508
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,460
stand on bios and like just like a more

509
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,460
like a longer waves like saying like

510
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,620
like how like what kind of person you

511
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,840
are it's almost like a cover letter

512
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,580
essentially

513
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,600
um

514
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,380
that's a great question uh I

515
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,820
have a different perspective than

516
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,400
probably most on on that front just

517
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,360
because

518
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,240
I think the most important thing is you

519
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,580
know the the person's experience and you

520
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,559
know who they are you know and a lot of

521
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,059
that you don't get from a cover letter

522
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,500
you get it from actually having a

523
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,179
conversation you know learning somebody

524
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:24,840
and so I typically went as a recruiter I

525
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,240
don't look at cover letters that much uh

526
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,400
you know if the experience fits you you

527
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,840
know you can demonstrate to me that you

528
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,120
know you you have a skill set in this

529
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,260
industry

530
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,320
um my perspective is is and that's worth

531
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,419
a conversation but I totally get it

532
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,280
where you know it may be required you

533
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,260
have to um

534
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,480
uh get get something you know in terms

535
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,460
of a bio together

536
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,620
um and that suggestion I would say you

537
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,900
know look at uh peers again kind of

538
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,220
going back to network

539
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,380
um you know a look at LinkedIn kind of

540
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,340
see

541
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,080
um you know what people how people word

542
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,340
different things

543
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,080
um look at leaders how they kind of talk

544
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,360
about themselves on LinkedIn but also

545
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,640
ask uh you know your friends hey can you
