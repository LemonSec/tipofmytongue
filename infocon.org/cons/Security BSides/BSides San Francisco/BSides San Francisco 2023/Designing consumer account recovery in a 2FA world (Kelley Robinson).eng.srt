1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,540
hello everyone thank you for being here

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,020
at b-sides FSF today

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,420
um just to let you know the slido is not

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,099
working today

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,380
but we will have Live question and

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,839
answers at the end and then we can also

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,400
if there's any follow-up questions we

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,260
can take care of that in the lobby thank

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,440
you

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,420
thank you thank you for having me last

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,400
time I spoke at b-sides was in February

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,800
of 2020 anybody remember that conference

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,599
there was like a sponsor here that was

14
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,000
giving out little like keychains of hand

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,219
sanitizer and when we were like packing

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,780
up at the end there were like hundreds

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,000
left over and a month later I was like

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,640
why didn't I take more of those but you

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,260
know we we didn't know right we didn't

20
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,760
know and I think that's one of the

21
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,960
things we've seen in the last couple of

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,879
years like a lot of things have changed

23
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,500
but one of the things that we've seen

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,820
change is there's a lot more people

25
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,360
doing business online now and that means

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,039
of course if there's more money that we

27
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,559
as like security people working in web

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,480
application security mobile

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,520
security uh there there's more

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,960
considerations that we have to deal with

31
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,280
because there's more fraud and there's

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,659
more money that's getting lost to

33
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,360
account takeover but we're also finally

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,100
starting to see some of these stronger

35
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,080
authentication methods things like web

36
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,780
often things like passkeys even that are

37
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,520
finally being used for a consumer

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,540
audience

39
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,840
but we're also all human right like we

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,119
need to consider account recovery in

41
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,799
this process when we're doing the

42
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,020
authentication uh system design that

43
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,640
we're building because we need to

44
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,740
balance that that humanness that user

45
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,799
experience with presenting fraud and I

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,180
specifically called out consumer account

47
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,400
recovery in this talk because one that's

48
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,320
what I focus on in my day-to-day work

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,060
but I think there's a little bit of a

50
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,079
different way that we have to think

51
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,520
about that

52
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,020
um when we're dealing with end user

53
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,520
consumers that are not our employees

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,500
that we're not paying to consider this

55
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,600
problem uh when we're thinking about

56
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,920
Enterprise account recovery you might

57
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,479
have like an IT Help Desk that you can

58
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,060
call up and and deal the answer that way

59
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,920
you know we're thinking about this in a

60
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,680
way that uh can there's a lot of overlap

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,240
between account recovery among the

62
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,920
spaces but you don't have that kind of

63
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,780
like Enterprise fallback so I'm going to

64
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,520
be focusing on the consumer side of this

65
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,419
today

66
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,459
so again thank you for having me here my

67
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,560
name is Kelly Robinson I've been a

68
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,300
developer for over a decade now and I've

69
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,160
been working in security at twilio for

70
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,379
the last six years I've been helping out

71
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,660
with b-sides SF for a few years too so

72
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,040
again thank you to the team for

73
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,599
everybody that's volunteered and for

74
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,000
having me back I focus on twilio's

75
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,319
account security products for things

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,840
like phone verification user identity

77
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,420
and two-factor authentication this talk

78
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,920
is going to incorporate a lot of the

79
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,540
things I've learned during my time there

80
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,700
uh from working with our developers and

81
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,319
working with our customers on their

82
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,480
authentication challenges and then it's

83
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,680
also going to incorporate some of the

84
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,940
things that we've learned we we own

85
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,980
authy we bought authy eight years ago

86
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,260
now some people still don't realize that

87
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,239
authy is owned by twilio but we have

88
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,000
this consumer facing product for MFA but

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,560
that also has an account recovery

90
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,540
process to it too right like so that's

91
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,220
something we have to consider when we're

92
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,680
building that product

93
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
so uh in terms of what I'm going to talk

94
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,120
about today after I get some context on

95
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,680
um what account recovery is and how I'm

96
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,060
thinking about it walk through the

97
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,920
options that we have including some real

98
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,420
life examples some companies that I

99
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,159
think are doing some stuff well that'll

100
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,480
wrap up with some recommendations and

101
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,879
how you can use this in your own systems

102
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,099
so of course we like we hope that users

103
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,540
don't lock themselves out of their

104
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,099
accounts right like that's that's the

105
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,659
hope but of course it's going to happen

106
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,580
and there's a lot of common reasons that

107
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,099
are not even like user error for this

108
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,120
um things that we have to think about

109
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,459
people change their phone numbers they

110
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,500
forget their passwords they lose their

111
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,659
device or authenticator or their

112
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,760
security key they upgrade to the latest

113
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,799
iPhone and they forget that there was

114
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,060
anything important on their old device

115
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,620
they forget that they needed to transfer

116
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,480
all of those Google Authenticator tokens

117
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,519
and now that all of a sudden those are

118
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,900
lost and so it's up to us to address

119
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,459
these issues while still guarding

120
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,260
against the attackers and the account

121
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,540
takeover attempts if anyone is in the

122
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,159
last session you know Pinterest was

123
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,659
talking about how they handle account

124
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,280
takeovers and some of the protections

125
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,500
they use against passwords this is going

126
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,720
to extend on that and talk about how you

127
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,340
might think about that with more than

128
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,780
just a password with some of these other

129
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,060
authentication methods that we that we

130
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,680
use and that we seek consumer

131
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,780
authentication

132
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,519
being used for

133
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,978
so again like account recovery is risky

134
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,540
because you're not just authenticating

135
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,120
you're re-proving the identity and it's

136
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,620
not an identity that comes with a clean

137
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,960
slate anymore it's not the sign up that

138
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,820
you you know you might not have to do

139
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,560
that email verification if your growth

140
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,180
team tells you that they want to skip it

141
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,160
the the existing account likely already

142
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,800
has data or money attached to it and so

143
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,880
that's one of the things that you have

144
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,380
to consider when you're reproving this

145
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,600
identity and the emphasis here is mine

146
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,040
but I really like how Mark Loveless

147
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,199
characterized account recovery here as

148
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,660
this alternative authentication system

149
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,300
uh he says in essence it's a bypass of

150
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,860
the main account security protocols and

151
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,600
therefore should be treated as this

152
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,380
alternative authentication system

153
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,540
and there are all these risks associated

154
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,220
with account recovery I think you know

155
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,900
we I tried to like pull the latest

156
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,300
numbers for like the cost of ATO fraud

157
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,800
and like I don't know like all these

158
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,360
companies these research companies have

159
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,440
different figures that they'll give you

160
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,699
but it's like always in the billions

161
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,680
right uh that's all exaggerate but it's

162
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,880
a lot of money and like your company

163
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,040
probably hopefully has some kind of

164
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,500
quantification of the cost of this to

165
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,360
your business whether that's the support

166
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,160
costs that you're dealing with in order

167
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,840
to address these account recovery

168
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,639
attempts or the amount of money that's

169
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,560
lost to fraud from the account takeover

170
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,660
actually happening and so the best

171
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,460
estimates that I could come up with from

172
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,080
the research that I found is that this

173
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,639
if you end up with that kind of Last

174
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,380
Resort if the user has to contact

175
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,840
support support calls can cost anywhere

176
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,720
from forty to seventy dollars per call

177
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,460
and so that's a lot of money that you

178
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,900
have to be thinking about if your user

179
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,300
ends up at that process and this is why

180
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,160
it's often worth it to invest in your

181
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,380
account recovery process to save your

182
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,120
support teams the headaches and to save

183
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,039
your company more money

184
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,660
so you have a lot of options for account

185
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,820
recovery you know and that goes beyond

186
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,460
just sending an email uh reset for your

187
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,800
password and so this is where we started

188
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,539
they see things like security questions

189
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,580
which are not recommended things like

190
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,320
backup codes fallback channels whatever

191
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,840
that might be for your business

192
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,400
and the requirements for account

193
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,020
recovery I wanted to highlight a couple

194
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,580
of things here because they might be

195
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,960
slightly different from your everyday

196
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,600
classic authentication and primarily

197
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,699
that since it's not happening very often

198
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,039
one it can be slower but two you need

199
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,620
methods that can be accessed without uh

200
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,539
constant rehearsal as I saw like one

201
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:29,699
researcher put it so we think about

202
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,440
something like a password or even a

203
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,479
security key if you're using that daily

204
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:35,280
like you're less likely to lose that

205
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,080
security key because you need it every

206
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,139
day to log into your computer or you are

207
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,419
constantly typing in your password I

208
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:43,620
know a lot of people in this room

209
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,960
probably use a password manager but a

210
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,000
lot of consumers and users of the end

211
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,100
user applications that we build probably

212
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,780
aren't so they're typing and they're

213
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,160
remembering these passwords and that

214
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,440
constant rehearsal helps them seven

215
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,479
eight nine months later when they you

216
00:06:57,479 --> 00:06:59,100
know lose that password lose the key

217
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,020
forget something they're not going to

218
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,639
have that same level of rehearsal for

219
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
whatever backup method and so this is

220
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,600
why security questions became a thing

221
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,160
because you're not like gonna forget

222
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,860
your you know first pet or the color of

223
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,020
your first car

224
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,819
but this also needs to be usable since

225
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:16,440
this is again I'm not suggesting that

226
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,880
you use security questions I'm just like

227
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,319
saying that's why they became popular

228
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,639
right

229
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,259
um but this is something that also needs

230
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,180
to be usable right um because this is

231
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,400
something that most people will do some

232
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,259
Google research from a little bit ago

233
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,180
reported a nearly linear relation

234
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,039
between time past and the number of

235
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,599
users who use the fallback

236
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,800
authentication system after 18 months 70

237
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,599
of Google's users had done some kind of

238
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,639
basic account recovery I'm sure your

239
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,440
business has seen similar things where

240
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,000
this is something that you definitely

241
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,979
have to deal with you're going to want

242
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,860
to build this into your considerations

243
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,300
now one thing I wanted to look at was

244
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,580
how the different methods how effective

245
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,380
the different methods can be right and

246
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,639
how effective they are for account

247
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,780
recovery

248
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,400
so the more of these that you collect

249
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,620
when the user first signs up the more

250
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,120
that you'll have to trust and verify

251
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,440
against when they attempt an account

252
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,300
recovery and this is one of those things

253
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,220
where you're like probably gonna if

254
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,840
anybody does like the account security

255
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,580
at your company you've probably had

256
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,960
those conversations with your growth

257
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,460
team right they're like no we need to

258
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,319
make this frictionless so that we can

259
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,599
get users signed up as fast as possible

260
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,879
so that I can hit my metrics of like the

261
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,860
number of users that signed up and

262
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,780
you're pushing back on that saying no we

263
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,000
need to have some level of assurance

264
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,280
about who these users are and this is

265
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,479
going to be that back and forth pull

266
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,099
that like I see some people nodding

267
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,679
about this right so this is something

268
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,419
that you want to think about have those

269
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,000
conversations when you collect these up

270
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,200
front you're going to have an easier

271
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,599
time down the line even if you're not

272
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,700
having those that user use one of those

273
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,380
methods that they enroll with every time

274
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,940
that they sign in this is why we do

275
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,740
email verification right you're not

276
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,519
necessarily having the user uh send an

277
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,320
email to themselves every time they log

278
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,880
in but this is something that comes in

279
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,500
handy down the line

280
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,760
all right let's start with some things

281
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,380
that you know these knowledge methods

282
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,880
these could be password security

283
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,500
questions or specific account

284
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,140
information like recent transactions or

285
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,240
hopefully other secret details account

286
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,620
about the account

287
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,019
I've had people ask me like how much a

288
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,600
recent uh expense was on my account that

289
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
I might have bought with an e-commerce

290
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,839
site I've had companies ask when I last

291
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,339
called customer support these are

292
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,899
examples of knowledge things that you

293
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,700
might encounter that aren't going to be

294
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,760
that kind of security question uh method

295
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,959
that we all

296
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,880
love

297
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,560
so uh knowledge factors are great

298
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,420
because they're easy to use and set up

299
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,279
and they can't be lost uh the reason

300
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,080
that again security questions became so

301
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,940
popular is because you're not going to

302
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,279
forget them but passwords can be

303
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,440
breached uh many security questions or

304
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,140
Account Details can be a search and it's

305
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,180
also not impossible to just find or

306
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,800
guess the street that someone grew up on

307
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,600
or the color of their first car right

308
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,880
and of course humans are forgetful so

309
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,860
anything like a password can be lost in

310
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,120
that way

311
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
uh possession factors these are the

312
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,899
things that you have uh these tend to be

313
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:02,399
more secure than passwords because they

314
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,440
can be harder to fish and they don't get

315
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,540
leaked in data breaches these could also

316
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,459
include things like your phone backup or

317
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,019
recovery codes and Hardware security

318
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,200
keys or um security tokens or Yuba Keys

319
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,120
when it comes to something that you have

320
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,740
uh people tend to lose and replace

321
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,240
things right like I talked about people

322
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,160
upgrading to the new iPhone or losing

323
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,959
their phone right and this means that

324
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:23,519
it's harder to guarantee for account

325
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,040
recovery possession can also introduce

326
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,720
that additional friction right and this

327
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,980
is one of the things that we always have

328
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,200
to think about even getting someone to

329
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,300
download an app can be a lot harder than

330
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,700
telling them to enter a security

331
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,279
question or something like that and this

332
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,360
is one of the things that I think we're

333
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,160
starting to try to change with Solutions

334
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,260
like pass Keys they're trying to solve

335
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,019
that usability problem by integrating

336
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,000
the authentication into the devices that

337
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,680
we already have and the systems that we

338
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,940
already use

339
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,680
and the third category that I wanted to

340
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,300
talk about is not inherence like if

341
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,500
you're following the kind of classic

342
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,140
three factors of authentication

343
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,079
um but it's actually the social proof uh

344
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,880
side of things and this relies on

345
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,620
authorizing trusted contacts and doesn't

346
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,120
really fall into that kind of classic

347
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,180
authentication Factor categorization and

348
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,459
so companies like Facebook obviously a

349
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:14,160
very social company from the get-go they

350
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,839
allow you to nominate three to five

351
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,760
friends that can help confirm your

352
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,800
identity before they give your account

353
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,480
back to you and the nice thing about

354
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,339
Facebook is they let you do this after

355
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,899
you get locked out of your account so

356
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,279
this is not necessarily something that

357
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,740
you have to set up before one of the

358
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,120
things that they ran into is then

359
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,240
hackers were trying to then friend

360
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,000
people on the account or like take over

361
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,920
an account by like adding new uh

362
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,680
untrusted friends and then doing the

363
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,779
account takeover and so Facebook has

364
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,820
fixed that problem by making sure that

365
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,160
the frenzy you're nominating to get your

366
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,959
account recovered are people that you've

367
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,880
had a longer term relationship with and

368
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,740
and that they identify as more trusting

369
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,540
contacts and so this is one of the

370
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,800
things right they're they're allowing

371
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,480
you to do this after the fact and so

372
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,940
you're going to be motivated to do this

373
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,220
uh the setup if you are a social company

374
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,500
that needs to get users to set this up

375
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,060
beforehand that might be the challenge

376
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,800
here right the the kind of usability

377
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,079
aspect of getting people to enroll in

378
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,720
this recovery Factor but I think this is

379
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,940
really smart if your company has any

380
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,220
kind of social or dynamic connections

381
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,779
between users this is definitely

382
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,820
something that you can use even in a

383
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,320
more like Enterprise setting right this

384
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,660
is a really you know smart way that if

385
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,399
you have multiple business users that

386
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,779
are tied to the same account you can

387
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,399
have them vouch for each other in terms

388
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,140
of getting the account access back

389
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,820
without having to contact like an

390
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,399
account rep or someone like that

391
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,380
a couple of like specific channels that

392
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,880
I wanted to highlight

393
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,260
um one type of possession factor that we

394
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,640
see a lot for account recovery is these

395
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,560
backup tokens or recovery codes and

396
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,779
these codes are given to you so they're

397
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,940
more likely to be longer and less likely

398
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,399
to be reused right however that means

399
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,779
that people have to store these

400
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,060
somewhere and while sites some sites

401
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,920
will give you explicit options I've seen

402
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,740
things from like uh write them down save

403
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,600
them in your password manager email them

404
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,740
to yourself like these are all

405
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,240
recommendations that I've seen in the

406
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,279
real world this is a screenshot from

407
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,200
Instagram that is a real example with

408
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,279
fake codes

409
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,079
that does not give any useful guidance

410
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,940
of what to do with these right

411
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,440
so I've always wondered like how

412
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,060
effective are these actually like do

413
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,980
people actually save them I met one

414
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,019
person that likes literally prints them

415
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,339
out and like puts them in their home

416
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,920
safe and that's great for them I'm not

417
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,899
gonna do that probably and most users

418
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,519
probably aren't either so like how many

419
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,920
users are actually doing this so I was

420
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,360
pleasantly surprised when I was talking

421
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,519
to one of our customers and they're

422
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,959
doing many thousands of authentications

423
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,820
every week and they're actually seeing

424
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,680
hundreds of users using their backup

425
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,200
codes every week and so one percent of

426
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,540
their users um are doing this on a

427
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,519
weekly basis and that might not seem

428
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,260
like a lot like one percent doesn't seem

429
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,079
like a big number but that does factor

430
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,700
out to hundreds of users and if that's

431
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,399
allowing those users to get back into

432
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,899
their accounts without going through

433
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,180
customer support that's good for both

434
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,639
you and your business and so this is one

435
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,899
of the things that like I was pleasantly

436
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,579
surprised to see that backup codes which

437
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,279
can be relatively easy to implement is a

438
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,600
reasonable solution for the account

439
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,700
recovery problem

440
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,440
and the last specific method that I

441
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,760
wanted to call out is pass keys right

442
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,620
like is anybody actually using pass keys

443
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,899
yet I see like a couple people like

444
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,360
enthusiastically raising their hands

445
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,680
um I've encountered this like on a

446
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,760
couple of companies I know like

447
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,560
cloudflare has implemented this good for

448
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,660
them I'm proud of everybody that's like

449
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,360
trying to push this forward so Caskey's

450
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,519
new Evolution of web authen and I know

451
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,200
there's critiques on past Keys like I've

452
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,560
heard people say like is it actually 2fa

453
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,760
um but I think one of the things that

454
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,680
peskies are trying to explicitly attempt

455
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,420
to solve is this account recovery

456
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,519
problem and that's because you're

457
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,899
syncing the private keys in the cloud

458
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,880
and like that's a little scary maybe but

459
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,220
what this allows is that that strong

460
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,920
form of authentication can be used by

461
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,899
default across devices without having

462
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,899
the user needing to authenticate or set

463
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,480
up every new device right so like I am

464
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,699
able to sign in on this laptop with a

465
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,279
touch ID because this that's stored on

466
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,320
this individual laptop like if I want to

467
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,720
you know use that same method on a

468
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,220
different device I have to register on a

469
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,779
different device but paskey's attempts

470
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:12,060
to solve that problem and apple calls

471
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,860
this out in their docks they say Pass

472
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,779
Key synchronization provides convenience

473
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,000
and redundancy in case of a loss of a

474
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,399
single device so this is great right but

475
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,480
then you read a little bit more into

476
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,800
this and Apple's not the only one that's

477
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,060
implemented this this is like an

478
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,000
industry-wide Collective but there are

479
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,620
alternative account recovery if you lose

480
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,899
all of your devices means that you use

481
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,760
your iCloud account password and SMS

482
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,860
authentication so you know we're they're

483
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,060
still thinking about the backup to the

484
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,380
backup to the backup right and that's

485
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,639
one of the things that we all have to

486
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,040
think about too as well

487
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,139
so let's send a look at a couple of

488
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:44,940
companies that I think are doing as well

489
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,899
um some companies are intentionally

490
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,399
vague about this but I've highlighted a

491
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,480
couple that like have pretty good

492
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,220
documentation about their process and

493
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,199
what they do for account recovery the

494
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,279
first one I already called out is

495
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,360
cloudflare

496
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,620
um I always look to them to see like

497
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,060
what they're doing on the Forefront of

498
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,680
authentication because I think you know

499
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,600
they serve a technical audience and so

500
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,699
you can probably get away with a little

501
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:04,440
bit more of like a tech forward approach

502
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,699
and a little bit more of like the

503
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,560
bleeding and Edge approach to some

504
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,720
authentication Solutions

505
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,980
um and so you know they were one of the

506
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,779
first companies that I saw to implement

507
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,000
web often they're now using pass keys

508
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,620
for that and they offer a lot of options

509
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,420
for account recovery but if you run out

510
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,220
of options this is kind of like the last

511
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,019
resort so in addition to email

512
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,180
verification they require an active

513
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,339
session on your account and if you don't

514
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:27,959
have an active session somewhere a

515
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,480
browser that's been previously logged in

516
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,180
um then you're kind of screwed it's

517
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,740
pretty common to you know require this

518
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,940
active session but it's not always

519
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,279
explicitly called out you can think of

520
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,660
this kind of like a possession Factor

521
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,519
right it's a previously verified device

522
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,279
or a browser and to be safe then they

523
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,600
also Implement a three to five day

524
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,279
waiting period and I'll talk a little

525
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,540
bit more about waiting periods in a

526
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,519
minute but it makes sense right like an

527
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,320
attacker might not want to wait but a

528
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,060
real user probably would and that's one

529
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,920
of those ways that you can start to

530
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,920
balance that ATO prevention

531
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,139
GitHub is another company that I think

532
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,639
you know is doing pretty great when it

533
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,500
comes to account recovery and and user

534
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,419
authentication in general also you know

535
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,339
calling us out as it probably serves a

536
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,500
more technical audience right like

537
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,760
um they have different considerations

538
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,280
and someone like Pinterest might uh and

539
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,439
GitHub has extensive documentation about

540
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,140
their 2fa recovery process they also

541
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,059
offer a lot of options for what you can

542
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,160
do in terms of setting up authentication

543
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,280
factors or fallback factors one option

544
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,140
is recovery tokens that they require you

545
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,460
to set up when you register certain

546
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,980
types of devices for authentication and

547
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,600
they will also allow you to fall back to

548
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,120
SMS if you have a stronger form of 2fa

549
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,460
enabled like tootp or Yuba Keys I've had

550
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,440
this debate with people of like is it

551
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,240
worth it to allow you know these

552
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,799
stronger forms of authentication like

553
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,220
totp yubikes if you're going to allow

554
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,140
fallback to SMS and like that depends on

555
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,880
how you approach it right like this is

556
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,080
something that's still probably going to

557
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,179
be stronger than maybe a customer

558
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,280
support probably cheaper than having the

559
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,460
user call customer support and it might

560
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,440
be enough of a hassle to deter some

561
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
amount of hackers they do also GitHub

562
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,700
does an interesting thing where you can

563
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,740
configure your Facebook account to store

564
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,720
a recovery token to get back into GitHub

565
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,059
that has the downside of requiring that

566
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,100
you have a Facebook account but the

567
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,900
upside is that you're likely to be able

568
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,400
to access Facebook even if you lose

569
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,080
access to GitHub those might be like two

570
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,640
different things that you have two

571
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,559
different sets of credentials for and

572
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,059
then anecdotally I have a friend that

573
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,140
went through the account recovery

574
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,940
process with GitHub

575
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,559
um and in line with a warning that

576
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,140
showed here uh get hold GitHub told them

577
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,700
that they needed to unlink their email

578
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,620
address so they could use it again to

579
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,419
create a new account they could Fork all

580
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,919
of their repos over to the new account

581
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,559
and then if in six months their old

582
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,299
account that was locked out is still

583
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,880
dormant they could re-access that

584
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,679
account their username would be released

585
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,320
to them and so that's pretty extreme and

586
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,059
unforgiving like six months I mean at

587
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,039
least it allows them to get access to it

588
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,960
eventually I don't know if this is still

589
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,059
true or true for all accounts

590
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,380
um maybe my friend's account was like

591
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,419
especially High risk but that's

592
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,340
definitely something that you want to

593
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,660
think about make sure you have those

594
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,100
recovery Keys saved for your GitHub

595
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,900
account and something that you can

596
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,760
consider in terms of the extremity

597
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,620
extrema disease of waiting periods that

598
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,539
you might consider

599
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,820
all right and then diving into some of

600
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,320
the recommendations so these are just

601
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,120
some examples of what different

602
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,160
companies are currently doing

603
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,080
um now what you can do for your own

604
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,299
company and I think it's important to

605
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,980
preface all this by saying that there's

606
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,679
no one right answer here so this is

607
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,200
taken from the Owasso multi-factor

608
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,880
authentication cheat sheet they say

609
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,860
there is no definitive best way to do

610
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,960
this and what is appropriate will vary

611
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,520
hugely based on the security of the

612
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,960
application and the level of control

613
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,360
that you have over your users this again

614
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,620
gets back to that kind of Enterprise

615
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,080
versus consumer authentication approach

616
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,820
that you might take think about what

617
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,380
makes sense for your company for your

618
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,179
users you definitely don't need to do

619
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:52,799
everything I recommend here this is kind

620
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,600
of like a menu of options that you might

621
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,460
think about as you're designing these

622
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,799
processes or revamping them

623
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,419
all right the biggest thing you can do

624
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,059
have users register more factors more

625
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,919
methods than they need than for everyday

626
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:07,500
login somebody kind of eloquently put

627
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,900
this like 3fa for 2fa you know it's not

628
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,820
really three factors but you know you

629
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,620
want to at least have two methods that

630
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,179
someone can use to get back into their

631
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,820
account if they have MFA enabled and the

632
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,260
biggest benefit of that is that you have

633
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,600
the additional trusted factors and that

634
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,799
you can use those to compare against

635
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,080
when your user loses access to one of

636
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,059
their main factors and the more that you

637
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,500
have registered the more confident that

638
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,000
you can be that it's the right person

639
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,260
that you're letting in and not an

640
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,480
account take over register these at sign

641
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,520
up during an active session that's

642
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,799
really up to you but requiring users to

643
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,960
register these additional factors you

644
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,039
know it might create some additional

645
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,780
overhead in that process especially

646
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,059
during sign up but it's justifiable for

647
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:46,799
certain use cases you know like fintech

648
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,419
some of these like higher Assurance

649
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,700
Industries where kyc has more

650
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,799
regulations and controls around it

651
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,480
that's something that you're probably

652
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,980
going to be okay with if somebody's

653
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,840
opening a new bank account like they

654
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,760
might expect that that might a couple of

655
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,440
minutes to do

656
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,419
uh similarly do some threat modeling

657
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,460
right like look at your ATO costs it's

658
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,200
going to be different for everyone maybe

659
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,400
this is something that isn't actually

660
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,900
costing you that much money if someone

661
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,940
contacts support and that's fine like

662
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,679
you might not need to do extensive

663
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,539
revamping of your process here if it's

664
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,400
not costing you a lot of money but

665
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,559
understand how much you're losing uh you

666
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,580
want to make sure that you're making the

667
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,900
right level of investment for your

668
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,980
company

669
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,360
um in the account recovery process

670
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,000
you're in that higher value industry

671
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,980
like Financial Services second mean

672
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,480
adding more friction to that recovery

673
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,919
process

674
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,419
um but consider it from your customers

675
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:35,400
perspective too right like did they

676
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,500
understand the value if you uh if you're

677
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,720
like gemini or coinbase and the user is

678
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,799
trying to go through this process

679
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,840
they're probably willing to put in a

680
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,760
little bit of extra effort to regain

681
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,140
access to their account they're going to

682
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,240
be okay with that waiting period

683
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,260
um you know that's probably going to be

684
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,640
more true than like if they're signing

685
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,360
up for Paramount Plus account uh along

686
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,559
the lines of looking at your threat

687
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,059
model you also want to be intentional

688
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,880
about where and how you're allowing your

689
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,580
staff to facilitate account recovery so

690
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,960
this was a conversation that I had on

691
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,700
Twitter DMS before Twitter imploded

692
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,620
where I was able to get a customer

693
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,080
support representative to reset my

694
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,520
account just by giving them my phone

695
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,620
number an email and my Twitter account

696
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,440
is my full name but it's not connected

697
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,539
to my profile of this company and I'm

698
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,039
not saying that this company shouldn't

699
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,960
let their customer support do this

700
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,039
because it was like a really easy

701
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,840
experience and that was nice but like

702
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,400
it's sensitive enough that I don't want

703
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,860
to tell you who it was and so I'm more

704
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,179
paranoid about this than the average

705
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,159
person because I'd like think about this

706
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,220
for my everyday work but is this

707
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,059
something that you want to think about

708
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,620
it's all about evaluating those

709
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,419
trade-offs

710
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,760
another thing you can do is prompt users

711
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,500
to confirm account information that

712
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,000
could be used for Recovery when they log

713
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,280
in this is something that's useful if

714
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,840
you have consumers that are coming back

715
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,179
to your application on a regular basis

716
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:52,740
obviously this is not going to be true

717
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,140
for everyone one of our customers you

718
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,820
know does tax preparation software

719
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,679
that's like a really hard thing to do

720
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,600
with account recovery right because you

721
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,280
have users that are using it about once

722
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,320
a year and they probably forget their

723
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,820
password in between years that can be

724
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,340
something that can be challenging but

725
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,260
one way that GitHub does the prompt for

726
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,080
account recovery is shown on this slide

727
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,360
and so there's a the same idea behind

728
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,039
things like security checkups email

729
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,720
notifications to review your account

730
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,520
that might be you know sending an email

731
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,100
notification to folks before tax season

732
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,780
if you're that kind of tax preparation

733
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,700
software that might be a strategy that

734
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,380
you could use and these types of

735
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,000
reminders are relatively cheap and easy

736
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,559
to implement especially compared to the

737
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,299
cost of a customer lockout or a support

738
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,559
call

739
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,360
be proactive about these types of

740
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,039
reminders send the email reminders

741
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,900
before the holidays before new iPhone

742
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,480
releases we always see authy customer

743
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,280
support tickets go up around these times

744
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,659
because that's when people tend to

745
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,640
switch phones and get locked out that's

746
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,080
one way you can do is that those

747
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,480
proactive email reminders

748
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,559
um and then hopefully you're already

749
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,299
doing this but design your 2fa

750
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,220
onboarding really well this is from a

751
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,700
2018 study 83 of Google users were able

752
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,740
to successfully set up Yuba Keys

753
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,900
compared to 32 percent of Facebook users

754
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,539
a lot has changed since 2018 in terms of

755
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:08,640
like Yuba keys and how they're designed

756
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,559
and the way that they work but I think

757
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,020
it's a good look at how onboarding ux

758
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,419
impacts users success right you want to

759
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:16,919
make sure that they're doing an actual

760
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,200
verification before you enable that on

761
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,720
their account 19 of people locked

762
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,159
themselves out of Windows entirely

763
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,500
because they didn't require the users

764
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,600
set it up correctly before they enabled

765
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,539
it as a like check mark on the account

766
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,120
and finally uh we recommend adding a

767
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,740
waiting period to deter hackers and give

768
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,539
real users time to dispute account

769
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,460
takeover attempts it's never going to be

770
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,640
perfect but it will be effective for the

771
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,380
right types of customers slow down the

772
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,980
attacker respond to legitimate users

773
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,419
um a couple of things that I want to say

774
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,700
you shouldn't do don't only use one

775
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,620
factor for account recovery if you have

776
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,539
two Factor enabled that kind of defeats

777
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,760
the purpose of account recovery and

778
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,440
please please don't be this company this

779
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,840
is like the situation that inspired this

780
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,120
entire talk which was if you're going to

781
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,860
disable two-factor authentication on

782
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,539
account recovery like don't even bother

783
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,299
offering 2fa right like in this

784
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,860
situation I'd forgotten my password or

785
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,780
gotten like messed up in my password

786
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,820
manager but I still had access to the

787
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,559
second Factor so like don't disable it

788
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,260
if you're that company and finally don't

789
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,760
let this discourage you don't give up on

790
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,340
2fa Google research shows that even SMS

791
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,740
codes sent to a recovery phone number

792
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,200
help present 76 of targeted attacks

793
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,179
that's really good coverage and can

794
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:31,620
protect our a lot of people from account

795
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,840
takeover I wrote a blog post about this

796
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,100
if you want to read more that's on the

797
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,500
twilio blog I hope I've given you some

798
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,760
ideas for how to think about your

799
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,919
account recovery processes do you have

800
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,480
any questions we're out of time but I'll

801
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,159
be out in the hallway you can find me

802
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,900
after the talk once again my name is

803
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,340
Kelly Robinson and thank you for

804
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,760
listening
