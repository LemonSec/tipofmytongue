1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,879
all right hello good afternoon thanks

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,220
for uh being here for another Villages

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,340
talk uh we have Ben hacker content

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,380
creator and all around great guy he's

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,599
going to be talking to us today about

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,000
um Scopes and maybe they matter maybe

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,619
they don't

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,359
um but anyways I'm going to hand on over

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,980
to Ben a quick Round of Applause

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,380
all right can you guys hear me okay hey

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,080
Wyoming cool all right let's talk about

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,039
uh

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,199
why hackers don't come out scope but

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,059
before we jump into it a quick little

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,399
intro about me I'm a hacker and content

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,320
creator before this I worked at a bug

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,600
Bounty platform hacker one that's when I

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,520
learned a lot about bug bounties I also

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,500
worked as a exec for security and

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,620
research I've helped identify hundreds

21
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,780
of bugs uh thousands of bugs over 100

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,539
bug Bounty programs and some of the

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,340
companies I've hacked on to our Apple

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,800
left Amazon Google the Department of

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,620
Defense and a couple more but just those

26
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,120
are to give you some big names that I've

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,100
been a part of

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,840
um about this talk

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,559
um

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,780
just out of curiosity how many here are

31
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,939
involved in a bug Bounty program or

32
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,220
managing a bug Bounty program you're

33
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,979
doing a bug Bounty platform maybe uh

34
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,020
I've seen a lot of people spin up bug

35
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,880
Bounty programs more and more it's

36
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,560
becoming very popular for a lot of like

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,780
security teams to spin up their blog

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,000
Bounty programs it's a way to secure

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,340
your products pretty much but I see a

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,299
lack of uh engagement and a lack of like

41
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:32,040
communicating with your hackers and also

42
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,720
getting the most out of your bug Bounty

43
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,060
program so we're going to talk about it

44
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,400
but the inspiration from this talk came

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,579
from this poster this is a kiwicon 2009

46
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,560
poster that Jason Haddix posted this

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,880
actually I can't take their credits for

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,799
it he's actually selling these on his

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,900
site if you want to grab one but he

50
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,579
posted that and if you can't read it I

51
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,259
made sure I communicate it properly to

52
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,659
you that hackers don't care about a lot

53
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,640
of things and scope is one of them your

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,159
project scope we don't care about if

55
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,340
it's a legacy system we don't care about

56
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,899
uh if it's you know if it's a proof of

57
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,640
concept still don't care about it but

58
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,479
there's a lot of different things

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,758
internal systems we don't care you

60
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,800
should care about him but we the point

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,260
is you can put all these limitations to

62
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,959
your bug Bounty program or your vdps but

63
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,239
guess what we still don't care about any

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,800
of these and you shouldn't either and

65
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,900
we'll talk about some of that more so

66
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,060
the talk so far what I've like

67
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,800
envisioned how do I present this thing

68
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,300
and how do I break it down we're going

69
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,940
to go between programs and hackers we're

70
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,800
going to talk about why as a program you

71
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,780
should be doing the bug body programs

72
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,819
differently and then how that helps with

73
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,739
the hackers and why hackers like me

74
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,360
would want to participate in your

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,220
programs more and more if you take some

76
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,040
of my advice back to your stakeholders

77
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,400
so there is the traditional approach of

78
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,800
doing a bug Bounty program you pick your

79
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,680
bug Bounty platform uh because you want

80
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,239
to get you know I feel like this is a

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,860
lot of your okrs for a bug Bounty

82
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,239
program if you're running one right you

83
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,340
want to get some vulnerabilities uh you

84
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,620
want to secure your products you want to

85
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,420
uh secure your customers data and you

86
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,739
want to hit your internal goals and

87
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,720
metrics that you have right do we agree

88
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,300
but then you give us this you give us

89
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,900
like a single scope of

90
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,580
www.site.com right and I I want to ask

91
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,860
you like is this really what you want to

92
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,659
get out of a program by just giving us

93
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:21,239
this one piece of you know scope like

94
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,459
you're giving us a website and a lot of

95
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:26,159
times it's www site has no functionality

96
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,019
it's talking to a bunch of different

97
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,260
systems but we as hackers can't do

98
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,360
anything about it because you gave us a

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,760
scope that we have to work with and a

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
lot of times if we work with that scope

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
or if we go out of scope there is uh

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440
punishments that come with it either we

103
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,599
don't get paid for the Bounty uh the

104
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,060
platforms get pissed at us or you don't

105
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,739
like the fact that we went out of scope

106
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,200
and goes back to my whole we don't care

107
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,879
about scope thing which we'll address in

108
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,720
a bit

109
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,840
but outside of not working with hackers

110
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,879
you are ignoring a bunch of different

111
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,040
things that work in the background of

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,019
that main core application right your

113
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,659
your app.site.com your main application

114
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,340
that you guys are putting into your

115
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,739
program it has a DNS server it has a DNS

116
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,360
Zone that maybe you know communicating

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,480
with it has a Dev site it has a Dev API

118
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,099
has a Dev environment whatever that

119
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,360
looks like for your infrastructure

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,880
there's a bunch of apis a lot of times I

121
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,978
see bug Bounty programs put their app in

122
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,860
there but then 90 of it runs from an API

123
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,840
that is not put in the scope maybe you

124
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,160
forgot about it or maybe you don't want

125
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,440
it to be in scope for some reason but a

126
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,060
lot of the data is being pulled in and

127
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,400
out of an API and then you have your

128
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,500
internal uh development tools you have

129
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,060
your Jenkins you know whatever is going

130
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,860
into your integration process and all

131
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,600
these toolings you're completely

132
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,759
ignoring it if it's being exposed to the

133
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,919
outside world because you want to put a

134
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,740
scope and limitation for your bug Bounty

135
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,580
program

136
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,280
so the goal of this talk is to give you

137
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,400
an idea or give you some sort of a

138
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,199
reason to go back to your orgs and say

139
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,780
hey we want to go from that to the

140
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,300
second one when everything we do as a

141
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,340
bug Bounty program is in scope and I did

142
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,440
that as a as one of my jobs at one of

143
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,759
the companies that I worked for that was

144
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,380
our goal they gave me that program and

145
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,440
we slowly added more assets we slowly

146
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,240
added more hackers and at some point

147
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,800
everything the company owned was in

148
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,080
scope and I think that should be in

149
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,880
short how you run a bug bonding program

150
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,500
and you're paying a ton of money to

151
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,360
these platforms or you whatever your

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,460
whoever is running a bug bonding program

153
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,900
you're spending a lot of money that's

154
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,460
coming out of your budget so you may as

155
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,620
well get your money's worth

156
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,840
and the other part of it is like let's

157
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,520
let's keep it honest you're gonna get

158
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,800
owned uh cyber criminals are going to go

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,840
after your infrastructure they will

160
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,699
definitely not care about your scope no

161
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:39,960
startup criminal is going to go to your

162
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,400
bug Bounty program and say hey guys

163
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,560
we're not touching the system the bug

164
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,720
manual program says it's Legacy we

165
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,740
should stay away from it they're going

166
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,300
to the opposite if it's Legacy it's

167
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,680
better for them because there's probably

168
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,479
vulnerable code in there that you don't

169
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,240
care to maintain or fix and they don't

170
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,500
care how they're going to get into your

171
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,180
system whether it's your third party

172
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,220
Services they want their pii and they

173
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,539
want your infrastructures right that's

174
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,000
what cyber criminals want to get into

175
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,380
depending on regardless of what the goal

176
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,940
is they're gonna do that it's gonna

177
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,800
happen whether you like it or not and

178
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,720
you have a bug Bounty program

179
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,300
that could do that for you and before

180
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,979
you all tell me we don't want it we

181
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:17,039
don't need it if we don't need bug

182
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,780
bounty hunters or red teamers people

183
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,520
that are doing the same thing as

184
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,039
adversaries or cyber criminals as an

185
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,440
industry we wouldn't be creating this

186
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,240
this wouldn't exist an external attack

187
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,520
surface management wouldn't exist as an

188
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,979
industry if we needed if we didn't need

189
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,660
something that could you know mimic the

190
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,759
adversaries the same tooling and the

191
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,199
continuous monitoring that they do right

192
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,300
so as an industry we created this

193
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,240
monster it is the last year at RSA there

194
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,740
wasn't a single vendor that I walked by

195
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,319
that wasn't selling ASM that are on easm

196
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,639
which is the external attacks of its

197
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,979
management right so you can't tell me

198
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,660
that you don't need it because if you

199
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,919
don't need it then why does your company

200
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,199
have this why are you spending contracts

201
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,440
to you know spend this on with other

202
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,180
companies that are doing this and the

203
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,280
other part of the esm thing is

204
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,500
a lot of these companies the asset notes

205
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,639
uh

206
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,680
let's see hadron that I worked at the

207
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,240
couple ones I got acquired recently

208
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,639
guess who created them bug bounty

209
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,500
hunters a good portion of them were

210
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,539
created by bug bounty hunters they took

211
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,460
their bug Bounty approach put it in an

212
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,440
infrastructure they automated it and

213
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,639
they're now selling it to you they're

214
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,020
making boundaries on the side and then

215
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,699
they're selling it to Enterprise and

216
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,919
they're making money so we created easm

217
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,319
as a industry because we didn't want to

218
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,720
you know open up our scope or work with

219
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,060
hackers even with with a pen test you

220
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,039
know the Scopes are limited sometimes so

221
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,660
I feel like we need to do more as an

222
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,360
industry whether it's bug Bounty or not

223
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,240
so if you can't beat them join them uh

224
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,500
it's I mean that's the best thing I can

225
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,720
the way I can say it is because you have

226
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,400
to we have to do something and Bug

227
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,000
bounties isn't the the solution but you

228
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,620
you are spending money with bug bounties

229
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,940
so you may as well leverage your blog

230
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,240
Bounty and uh do the same thing so we're

231
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,380
going to talk about the hackers

232
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,479
perspective of this I'm doing okay with

233
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,259
time

234
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,520
so now we're going to take a look at the

235
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,639
accurate perspective of how it works uh

236
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,259
so work with hackers

237
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,539
and you know I wanted to like kind of

238
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:10,979
address like hackers do care it's not

239
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:12,180
that we don't care about things but

240
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,580
hackers do care about having a bug

241
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,020
Bounty program that's fun you know they

242
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,759
want to find a program that's engaging

243
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,979
they want to work with them uh they want

244
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:21,840
a wide or Wild Card scope it doesn't

245
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,759
have to be everything you own but it

246
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,500
could be something that's big enough if

247
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,120
your product's big enough like you know

248
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
Salesforce is a huge company their

249
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,020
product Salesforce alone is huge Airbnb

250
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,760
was a big one they they did their core

251
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,440
app and then eventually put everything

252
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,179
in school but we want to hack on things

253
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,640
that we can dedicate hours to or days to

254
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,140
instead of hours

255
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,479
so we want to also identify your

256
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,880
infrastructure a lot of times I've

257
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,500
talked to a lot of Engineers when I

258
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,779
submitted vulnerability and they go how

259
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,000
do you know this belongs to us so it

260
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,040
tells me that you don't even know uh

261
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,540
these sites belong to you and that's

262
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,420
again why we have ASM as an industry but

263
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,760
we can do that thing for you we can we

264
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,800
can create this uh ecosystem of us

265
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,959
identifying your assets and Reporting

266
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,839
vulnerabilities within them of course we

267
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,120
want to publish our research we want to

268
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,560
make the internet secure at least most

269
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,779
of us do we care about bounties and it

270
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,160
just all goes down to just wanting to

271
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,480
own your stuff

272
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,779
as a company and the way we do it is I

273
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,180
personally looked at this and I go when

274
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,980
I'm doing a bug Bounty program the

275
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,080
immediate question that I ask myself is

276
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,839
how can I affect this company's users

277
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,180
data or the infrastructure because if I

278
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,279
get infrastructure access then I get pii

279
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,500
if I dump pii in any way then I've

280
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,360
already got my dog my job is done right

281
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,980
so the first question that a lot of

282
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,320
hackers who are coming from a how do I

283
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,060
mimic an adversary approach to bug

284
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,940
bounties is this in some aspect aspect

285
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,560
this is how I look at it this is what I

286
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,700
think at least

287
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,100
so I asked myself how do I do that and

288
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,420
that's very difficult to do when you

289
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,640
give me this because I can't scope out

290
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,980
your internal sites you have an

291
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,820
internal.site.com that I can't touch

292
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,040
because it's out of scope I can't touch

293
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,480
your Dev sites I may have more

294
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,920
functionalities it could be open to

295
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,640
foreign

296
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:17,040
I know that they've been around for

297
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,160
years but they all have a lot of

298
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,399
bounties paid and do you know what they

299
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,500
all have in common

300
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,540
besides the security budget that they

301
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,180
have that's huge they also have uh huge

302
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,980
Scopes you know the the bigger companies

303
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,360
that I've seen that are successful

304
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,820
they're taking out the the risk of

305
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,040
saying hey we want you to hack on

306
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,899
everything we own Airbnb as a

307
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,220
infrastructure it's not a huge

308
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,019
infrastructure they have a lot of

309
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,579
different uh Acquisitions that has

310
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:46,680
happened over the years but when Airbnb

311
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,240
launched your program five years ago

312
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,339
they gave us everything that they owned

313
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,899
even though it was small but it made it

314
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,459
a challenge for me to identify more

315
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,860
places to hike on because they gave us

316
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,320
an open canvas of doing what we want as

317
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,880
hackers we did whatever we wanted to so

318
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,459
sometimes I found uh vulnerabilities in

319
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,079
their core app sometimes I found stuff

320
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,240
that was in their API and sometimes I

321
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,279
found stuff that was leaked on GitHub so

322
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,560
there was just I could pick what side of

323
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,420
this company do I want to hack into or

324
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,880
what part do I want to attack and by

325
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,620
choice I have better options doing that

326
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,420
for a big company versus a company

327
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,700
that's giving me uh

328
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,800
this one so I can't do a lot of the work

329
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,839
that I want to on this side so

330
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,240
so it's not huge Scopes it's just they

331
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,100
have more engagement uh one of the

332
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,600
things they have in common is you'll see

333
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,760
a lot of the top hackers are on these

334
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,279
programs because of the wide scope

335
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,380
because they're adding more assets over

336
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,300
time and the increased Bounty budget

337
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,459
over time once you have a lot of these

338
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,260
bugs coming it's a justification for you

339
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,940
to go to your stakeholders and say hey

340
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,579
we're getting good loans can we get more

341
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,740
budget to pay the hackers and find

342
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,260
things and honestly this is not on the

343
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,540
uh on the part of the talk but just

344
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,880
talking to a couple of people outside I

345
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,200
think we should also step away from

346
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,120
having bug bounties be in the opsec side

347
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,920
and give it to the red teamers so they

348
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,420
can see how far that could have gone

349
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,820
could could that RC in the site gold

350
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,860
Elevate access to your internal Network

351
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,600
and that kind of stuff so it's just I

352
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,980
feel like overall with bug Bounty you

353
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,120
have this proof of concept that you're

354
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,680
going to spend money on the government's

355
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,820
going to make it a thing for every

356
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,500
company eventually have a VDP whether we

357
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,480
like it or not so why not make the most

358
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,060
out of it and get better coverage by you

359
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,980
know adding things over time

360
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,160
so we want to go from that and oh

361
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,000
I broke it

362
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,339
that one works okay so this one works

363
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,320
oh it's not perfect so if you're giving

364
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,420
me this uh what you're going to miss out

365
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,040
on is like cool bugs like this these are

366
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,200
just me browsing on hacker one

367
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,420
these are things that is not even on

368
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,100
your infrastructure this is hosted on

369
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,800
GitHub this is hosted on a a random

370
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,420
website that you posted some notes on

371
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,100
this is uh hosted on your third-party

372
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,839
services or your JavaScript files that

373
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,000
people come across you miss these things

374
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,260
like your public

375
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,540
Jenkins instances your uh your heat

376
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,760
pumps are out there for your apis all

377
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,260
these different cool wounds and research

378
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,459
that could come out of your bug Bounty

379
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,019
program that you're missing out on just

380
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,360
because you want to be on the safe side

381
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,920
of a bug Bounty program because the

382
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,300
legal teams don't want to deal with it

383
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,220
or because your stakeholders don't want

384
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,940
to be doing the work to go up to a

385
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,700
bigger bug Bounty program so I don't

386
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,380
have a solution I have a solution slide

387
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,540
but I don't have a solution for you I

388
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,100
have a suggestion that I can't propose

389
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,079
because the solution is up to you and

390
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,839
your team to figure out how fast and how

391
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,220
quick you can put more things in scope

392
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,740
but we wanted to look at two things with

393
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,980
bug bounties uh you don't get to do the

394
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,540
social engineering and phishing right

395
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,160
that's the thing that bug bounties can

396
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,019
do I know that most companies think the

397
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,579
way they get owned is through phishing

398
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:42,300
which

399
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,639
web is also I think high up there with

400
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,380
uh with how companies are getting owned

401
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,360
nowadays but the true thing is cyber

402
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,500
criminals are going to do the same thing

403
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,139
you know we can't do fishing and social

404
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,300
engineering but we can do the web stuff

405
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,399
but also the similar tooling and the

406
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,380
approach is very similar a lot of the

407
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,180
the good hackers that you look at they

408
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,620
come up from an adversary perspective

409
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,820
and they try to do that with their bug

410
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,160
bountying and the difference is one's

411
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,779
going to play by the rule and the other

412
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,040
one's gonna quote unquote sell your

413
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,959
stuff on the dark web and you have to

414
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,820
pick one or the other

415
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,639
so the number one thing is I think from

416
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,740
bug Bounty platforms I've seen a huge

417
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,260
shift from just sales to also educating

418
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,120
and educating people why they should do

419
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,860
their blood bonding program but also as

420
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,120
people that are running these bug Bounty

421
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,440
programs I think we need to as an

422
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,180
industry for bug Bounty industry create

423
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,220
something for these legal teams that are

424
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,899
going to be okay with wanting to work

425
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:33,000
with companies that are out there in the

426
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,339
world uh that it's not in the US it's

427
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:36,660
not Europe I think the biggest scary

428
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,220
thing is I don't want to work with this

429
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,139
hacker out in this country and I think

430
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,399
there's education that needs to be done

431
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,139
that these platforms are doing

432
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,060
background checks you know they have

433
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,699
done some ID verification and so on so I

434
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:48,839
think there's a lot of Education that

435
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,339
could go there and honestly if you are

436
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,260
doing a bug Bounty program I've seen

437
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,000
this mistake happen over time a lot I

438
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,260
see a lesson and less of this happening

439
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,380
now with uh the platforms being around

440
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,079
that they they do the the walk crawl

441
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,360
approach and then you start sorry crawl

442
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,800
walk and then running approach you don't

443
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
go all in and put everything in the

444
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,459
scope but you make it a goal you say hey

445
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:09,660
we're going to launch a bug Bounty

446
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,480
program and within a year within two

447
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,620
years we're going to add more and more

448
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,720
to our scope and just having that goal

449
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,100
and having that buy-in throughout these

450
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,779
years it's going to push you to want to

451
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,639
do those things so do them in phases

452
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,320
your first quarter or your first two

453
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,820
quarters of black body should be private

454
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,560
it should be your main core asset I

455
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,420
understand that's the the meat of your

456
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,160
product but eventually after the first

457
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,500
quarter and two second quarter when the

458
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,120
submission started to die down you want

459
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,680
to go to the next phase of adding more

460
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,240
and more maybe bundle him all together

461
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,339
so this next next phase you have a

462
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,480
bundle of new domains and then

463
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,459
eventually you work up the courage to

464
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,199
put everything in the scope of your bug

465
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,940
bounding program

466
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,800
uh and then the last one is deal more

467
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,620
lenient with your scope uh it's okay if

468
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,660
hackers go out of scope on accident I'm

469
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,279
not saying reward them but also don't

470
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,380
punish them don't go to the bug Bounty

471
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,699
platforms and say hey this hacker went

472
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:57,899
out of scope especially if you're going

473
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,160
to fix the vulnerability if you're

474
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,320
getting value out of it make it more

475
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,660
welcoming without you know I get that

476
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,279
you don't want people to go out of scope

477
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,440
set those rules up but study

478
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,000
communication for hackers to be able to

479
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,160
ask you hey I found this asset

480
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,480
interesting I think I can find this

481
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,760
vulnerability can I test this I think

482
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,500
that alone is a big thing but also

483
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,380
putting some language around saying hey

484
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,060
if you find something that could

485
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,040
directly affect our Network our

486
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,380
infrastructure or our users without

487
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,540
hitting a third party we'll be happy to

488
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,279
hear from it and maybe award it but just

489
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,440
the language you use is different saying

490
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,540
hey we're open to it versus putting the

491
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,860
finger up and saying no no we don't want

492
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,980
to work with you because it's just uh

493
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,380
it's not gonna take us away from the

494
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,259
going from a single scope to a wild card

495
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,459
thing and then hackers aren't going to

496
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,199
engage with you if they get punished

497
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,759
hackers talk to each other so if one

498
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,139
hacker is getting banned from a platform

499
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,060
or a program it just becomes a thing

500
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,259
that most hackers are going to be turned

501
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,339
off by it

502
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,899
so again I'm going to put this side up

503
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,459
one more time we don't want the first

504
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,259
one we want more of the bottom one I

505
00:16:58,259 --> 00:16:59,759
think I speak for all bar bounty hunters

506
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,320
when I say with the second one is the

507
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,660
one we want uh and yeah that's it if you

508
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,040
want to come and meet us and talk to us

509
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,419
I'll be at the bug Bounty Village all

510
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,520
day tomorrow we're doing a web hacking

511
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,980
uh workshop with Jason Haddix I'm

512
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,260
hosting the Hong Kong June 16th and I'm

513
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,520
also doing a training if you want to do

514
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,679
more bug Bounty and web hacking and uh

515
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,699
if you want to get in touch with me

516
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:20,160
there's my Twitter social media and also

517
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,900
my email as well

518
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,339
if there's any questions I'll be happy

519
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,190
to answer

520
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:31,320
[Applause]

521
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,860
check check

522
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,880
um I could ask it direct but I guess in

523
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,340
terms of getting that feedback on Bounty

524
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,840
programs

525
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,700
um from hackers like what's successful

526
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,380
what's not

527
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,100
um

528
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,720
where do you recommend doing that like

529
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,360
through like Twitter or bug Bounty Forum

530
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,179
or like those type of channels or

531
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,179
some is there some other uh as a founder

532
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,500
of black Brownian form I would say don't

533
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,480
do it unblock money for them yeah yeah

534
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,120
it's a wrong place to ask but I would

535
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,320
say ask your researchers that are

536
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,940
sending stuff to you okay now when

537
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,440
you're awarding someone if you put a

538
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,520
link and says hey we want you know

539
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,780
either a link or a question I'm saying

540
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,220
hey can you answer these questions for

541
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,380
us would I appreciate it I think talking

542
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,640
to the people that are submitting to you

543
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,559
is more valuable than on Twitter yeah

544
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,000
because you can also get the the people

545
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
that I that don't like to do bug

546
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
boundaries still chime in or the leads

547
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,020
that are in the bug bonding committee

548
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,360
chime in so directly from your hackers I

549
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,580
know uh both of the big platforms have

550
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,559
direct communication to your hackers

551
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,820
they can select hey hackers have

552
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,740
submitted a bug to me or hackers I've

553
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,419
done X send them a survey but the report

554
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,520
itself I think is the best way to ask

555
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,320
I'm like Hey we're curious what can we

556
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,240
do to engage you more whether they need

557
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,520
credentials they need you know some

558
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,960
account type or something that could

559
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,280
give you direct feedback for it no

560
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,440
that's great thank you thank you

561
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,360
we have time for more

562
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,100
with the uh I guess current Advent of

563
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,500
journalist AI how it's just blossomed

564
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,780
and mushroomed how has that affected

565
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,419
your your uh the things that you're into

566
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,400
now is it made things easier does it

567
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,380
made it more difficult or uh the thing

568
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,880
that I'm into as a content creator has

569
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,620
made it easier because I can rely on AI

570
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,299
to help me create more content easily

571
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,740
you can have my La I have my labs

572
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,780
created by AI sometimes like chat CPT

573
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,000
but I don't think it's going to affect

574
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,280
the the triage part of it just yet maybe

575
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,480
there's some machine learning that could

576
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,440
have fit that I know a lot of these bug

577
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,000
Bounty platforms use machine learning to

578
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,740
a way but I don't I'm one of the people

579
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,120
that's going to be resistant to saying

580
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,700
it's AI is very far from taking over bug

581
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,980
Bounty both from a hacker perspective or

582
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,539
triage or blood Bounty Platforms in

583
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:38,660
general

584
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,740
I know you can write better reports than

585
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,120
chat GPT honestly but

586
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,280
very interesting talk thank you very

587
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,820
much thank you just like hackers uh VP

588
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,620
of engineering engineering managers

589
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,720
directors they also don't care about

590
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,460
scope good to hear yeah all the carers

591
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,679
can I ship this feature or product

592
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,260
securely or not but as a product

593
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,480
security engineer we do care about scope

594
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,640
because that kind of you know Keeps Us

595
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,160
on track so what are your views on that

596
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,940
I think uh it depends on org to org but

597
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,740
at the end of the day you know when it

598
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,840
comes to debug bounties you can put a

599
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,640
scope on it but whether you like as a

600
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,559
team having a scope or not it's not

601
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,700
going to matter with the adversaries

602
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,080
it's not going to matter for cyber for

603
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,000
cyber criminals so instead of working

604
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,740
against people that want to help you I

605
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,780
think just having the leniency of being

606
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,880
open to getting reports is different

607
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,679
than not having that a lot of times what

608
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,419
I see is they're giving you that no no

609
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:37,980
don't go out of scope and then when you

610
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,419
go out of scope you get an email from

611
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,160
the support team or the you know the

612
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,360
team that are on the platform side

613
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,460
saying hey you go we went out of scope

614
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,600
and you know we tell you not to go out

615
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,220
of school so I think it's a leniency of

616
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,620
being open to accept something that may

617
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,240
be out of your scope because it benefits

618
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,520
you understood what do you think about

619
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,940
scope creep about what about scope creep

620
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,280
uh about a school I depends I mean

621
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,220
that's a broad term but uh I don't I

622
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,960
can't that's a little question I feel

623
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,440
like thank you you're welcome thank you

624
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,039
one more

625
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,340
hey Ben I have a question for you so I

626
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,220
think uh obviously bountyors can make

627
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,900
more money sometimes if they go out of

628
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,640
scope but there's got to be a line at

629
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,260
some point right a line where if you

630
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,780
cross it you're like borderline criminal

631
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,280
like stealing data you shouldn't access

632
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,440
where is that line for you

633
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,940
um my line is if I can export something

634
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,799
especially out of scope I report it and

635
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,240
I tell them like hey I could do this

636
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,580
thing do I have permission to go into it

637
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,559
and do it I think I draw the line of

638
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,480
like I know I went out of scope

639
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,000
but I'm not going to I don't ask for

640
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,559
money there was recent news of someone

641
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,539
saying hey we want to help you with your

642
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,940
product but Bounty please that's the

643
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,440
draw I don't know I don't ask for Bounty

644
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,539
because when you ask for money you may

645
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,760
not be extorting the company but you you

646
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,140
knew what you were doing was wrong going

647
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,940
out of scope so it's just I found

648
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,140
something I say this is what I found

649
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,059
this is what I can do with it can I do

650
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,280
more a lot of times I'm lucky enough to

651
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,200
know about the companies but a lot of

652
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,360
people don't have that connection

653
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,220
so just having the communication putting

654
