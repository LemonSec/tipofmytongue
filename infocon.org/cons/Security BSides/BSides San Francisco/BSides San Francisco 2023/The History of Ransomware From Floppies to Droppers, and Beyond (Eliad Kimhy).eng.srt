1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,740
thank you all for joining my name is

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,940
eliad

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,560
um I do a talk about the history of

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,420
ransomware

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,760
um currently I work at a company called

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,580
Akamai I am one of the people who lead

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,799
the publication of security research

8
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,299
there

9
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,180
um I also produced a podcast called

10
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,160
malicious life about the history of

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,720
cyber security that's where I got my

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,180
passion for this stuff and that's where

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,260
you can find a lot more information

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,240
about this

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,060
um I'm also from Berlin so I flew in

16
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,460
yesterday maybe I'm a little I might be

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,340
a little jet-lagged I actually had a

18
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,140
weird dream that I actually missed the

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,379
talk and I had all these emails and then

20
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,600
I woke up it was 10 p.m yesterday and I

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,239
was like you idiot like you went to

22
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,280
sleep at eight how are you gonna miss a

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,860
talk at 3 P.M but here we are so the

24
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,200
history of ransomware from floppies to

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,860
droppers this is my beautiful pun that I

26
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,480
created today we're going to talk a

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,280
little bit about some uh some stories

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,940
from the history of cyber security we're

29
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,220
going to talk about how ransomware

30
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,159
evolved some of the elements like the

31
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,380
encryption the business model the

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,659
delivery this is a talk I usually give

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,680
in 35 40 minutes so I've made it a

34
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,119
little bit shorter so we're going to run

35
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,000
through it but I hope you guys enjoy and

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,340
and learn something it's a difficult

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,780
talk to follow the one that was before

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,740
me because it was really really

39
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,619
interesting but uh hope I can do it

40
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:29,759
justice

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,360
so before we start does anybody know

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,820
what was the first ransomware when did

43
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,920
it happen uh

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,720
can any does anybody know you wanna

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,700
anybody want to scream

46
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,079
89 that's right 89 1989 which is weird

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,840
because some some of the people here in

48
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,860
this room uh weren't born before 1989.

49
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,540
which is pretty weird when one of the

50
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,579
biggest problems that we're dealing with

51
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,220
right now is older than some people who

52
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,020
are actually here or

53
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,100
um or some some people's children but it

54
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,500
is a very old problem and the story of

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,000
the first Transformer is actually a

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,599
bizarre story and we'll talk about it so

57
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,400
this is the first ransomware it was

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,280
spread by floppy disks it was called the

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,060
AIDS information software or security

60
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,700
people call it the AIDS Trojan and

61
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,760
that's a terrible name right with a

62
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,640
terrible connotation but already we're

63
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,580
getting some connections to how malware

64
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,500
works today and the type of social

65
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,140
engineering that is being done in the

66
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,239
Modern Age

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,459
this was a a Trojan that was written by

68
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,879
a man man called Joseph L Pope in 1989

69
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,340
and he had this brilliant idea where he

70
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,040
figured if I'm going to if I can just

71
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,959
create this software that encrypts

72
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,599
people's computers and I can send them a

73
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,160
floppy disk and I can get them to put

74
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,239
that in and they they their computer

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,459
will get encrypted and then I can make

76
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,560
some money and and that's what he

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,379
actually did it was a brilliant idea and

78
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,260
so so so bizarre so this man Joseph L

79
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,480
Pope decided he's going to send all

80
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
these floppy disks out by mail

81
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,400
individually and when a person puts that

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,099
into their computer and asks them to

83
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,780
turn on their printer

84
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,620
it prints out a ransom note and encrypts

85
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,260
their their device and what was a

86
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,840
brilliant plan to get all the money all

87
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,180
this sweet sweet cash I think you can

88
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,099
see here this is this is the ransom note

89
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,659
it was 378 dollars you send it to a PO

90
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:42,360
Box in Panama which was just the

91
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,000
brilliant idea of of taking a vacation

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,360
as you collect the uh the proceeds so

93
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,019
this guy was crazy and brilliant

94
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,599
but that's what he did and we can look a

95
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,420
little bit at um in more detail at what

96
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,819
were some of the elements that brought

97
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,560
this this whole thing together and then

98
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,060
compare them and maybe talk about the

99
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,560
evolution

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,420
um but it was composed of three

101
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,580
different little details you know the

102
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,000
delivery which uh you know nowadays we

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,920
call it the sneakernet the idea that

104
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,480
things don't really

105
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,220
um you know he had to send it by snail

106
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,260
mail we didn't have an internet then it

107
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,720
wasn't anything that anybody used at

108
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,220
that point

109
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,380
um or we maybe we had some precursors to

110
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,040
to that but uh in those days you can

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,840
just send a file over to somebody you

112
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,060
had to actually physically get that to

113
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,800
them and here I think we have a little

114
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,440
bit we talked about this this topic of

115
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,199
of the AIDS Trojan the AIDS virus

116
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,040
um you know part of why this was

117
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,440
successful or part of why this actually

118
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,860
ended up working this bizarre idea is

119
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,639
two things one this man Joseph L Pope

120
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,320
sent this he had the actual physical

121
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,139
addresses of AIDS researchers around the

122
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,780
world and he sent them a software about

123
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,180
the thing that they were researching so

124
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,900
that was some incentive to open that and

125
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,320
this type of social engineering is

126
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,820
something that we see today and I think

127
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,280
we saw three years ago four years ago or

128
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,080
sorry it's hard to keep track with the

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,780
with the covid-19 virus we saw a lot of

130
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,540
social engineering about this type of

131
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,780
um about this type of epidemic this is

132
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,919
something that a lot of people were

133
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,960
thinking about at the time and in the

134
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,720
late 80s this was an important topic to

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,940
a lot of people

136
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,199
not the least of which are people who

137
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,660
are researching this so this man they

138
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,180
found in his parents house I think ten

139
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,860
thousand between ten thousand fifteen

140
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,139
thousand floppy disks which was a

141
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,639
immense uh Financial investment

142
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,160
and he actually did send all of them by

143
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,139
mail which was

144
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,940
ridiculous

145
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,919
um a ridiculous amount of investment of

146
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,780
time but that's uh that's how he got it

147
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,759
there we'll look at what happened with

148
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,520
this uh encryption his encryption was

149
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,680
very basic it was symmetric symmetric

150
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,060
encryption

151
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,220
um it wasn't uh sophisticated wasn't

152
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,539
this the encryption that we know of

153
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,400
today he actually did a couple of things

154
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,680
in there he kind of hid the files he

155
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,780
changed the names

156
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,539
um but it wasn't anything fancy and

157
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,160
actually fewer software engineer you

158
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,919
could reverse it pretty easily the

159
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,139
problem was that not a lot of people

160
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,060
back then understood what was going on

161
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,039
inside their computers and that's

162
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
actually a really sad part of the story

163
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,300
some researchers lost a lot of their

164
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,400
research because they were just clicking

165
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,020
pushing all the buttons trying to fix

166
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,500
the problem and they ended up deleting

167
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,360
some of the files and it ending ended up

168
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,759
losing years and years of research which

169
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,380
was pretty sad

170
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,060
um sorry about that I don't know what's

171
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,400
happening with the screen right now I'm

172
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,780
being hacked live maybe this is somebody

173
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,900
else's demo

174
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,220
so we'll look at the encryption and how

175
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,139
that evolved and then the business model

176
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,199
the brilliant P.O box and Panama idea

177
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,639
which is kind of like something that

178
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,020
you'd think a child would kind of come

179
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,720
up with you know get the money go on a

180
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,520
vacation but that's that's how he

181
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,020
figured he'll he'll make the money and

182
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,300
eventually

183
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,160
that's one of the things that got him

184
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,800
arrested because his name was on the PO

185
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,419
box and

186
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,419
you can't do that

187
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:24,479
you know so the the P.O box his name was

188
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,919
there they kind of they figured out who

189
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,740
it was you know people losing uh you

190
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,960
know years and years of research and and

191
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,520
the fact that he was targeting these

192
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,960
people in the first place researchers

193
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,060
was already something that brought it to

194
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,400
uh public attention

195
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,800
um and the delivery the tens of

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,199
thousands of floppy disks was a lot of

197
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,720
evidence that they could use

198
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,460
um and all of these different components

199
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,020
ended up bringing them down so part of

200
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,699
our journey will be to discover how do

201
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:51,960
you do all these things without getting

202
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,880
caught and

203
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,460
um yeah which which is unfortunate but

204
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,440
that's that's what that's what enables

205
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,660
this technology to work today

206
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,460
um he was actually caught in Amsterdam

207
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,560
at the airport was kind of walking

208
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,440
around aimlessly somebody alerted the

209
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,060
authorities

210
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,800
um they took them in they realized this

211
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
is the guy the guy with Panama guy and

212
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
uh they took him to court the guys

213
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,979
showed up with curlers in his beard and

214
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,280
all sorts of weird things were happening

215
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,919
um and so the judge made the decision

216
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,259
that this guy's insane and we're gonna

217
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,660
let him go

218
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,240
so in 1989 if you wrote rents where you

219
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,919
do they think you're crazy and you'd let

220
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,779
them go and honestly I mean at the time

221
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,899
this probably did look a little crazy

222
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,099
well let's talk a little bit about

223
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,779
encryption

224
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,940
um I want to do a detour this is part

225
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,399
like kind of trying to figure out lay a

226
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,959
path through the history but I want to

227
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,600
do a little detour because encryption

228
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,140
wasn't easy you know even in the in the

229
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,000
later points where you sort of wrote

230
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,620
encryption into software but certainly

231
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,779
in the earlier days

232
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,279
um and also there was a certain amount

233
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,860
of when we talk about Joseph L Pope uh

234
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,779
you know the fact that people had lost

235
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,620
their data was a factor that that sort

236
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,800
of made made his case a lot worse

237
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
because he's actually causing damage so

238
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,060
what did hackers do somewhere in the

239
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,519
2010s what's easier than writing

240
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,800
encryption not writing encryption and

241
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,060
just letting telling you that you're

242
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,620
encrypted or telling you that you're

243
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,779
locked and this was a fad back in the

244
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,940
day these screen lockers which I find

245
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,399
very interesting because somebody sends

246
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,200
locks your screen and tells you that the

247
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,360
you know DOD and the Department of

248
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,220
Homeland Security and the FBI and

249
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,779
everybody's just on your case because of

250
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,200
all the dangerous materials you have and

251
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
if you just send us 30 bucks in gift

252
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,980
cards

253
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,660
good to go

254
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,399
um so that was the whole concept and

255
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,839
some people fell for it and there was

256
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,760
even a case of somebody who turned

257
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,060
himself in for having actually illicit

258
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,680
materials on their computer because of

259
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,080
one of these scams and I think that was

260
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,019
yeah the only only person ever that that

261
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,420
happened too but I think that's um

262
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,820
pretty funny but in terms of encryption

263
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,740
I mean I think encryption is not an old

264
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,600
thing we talked I mentioned symmetric

265
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,339
encryption there's asymmetric encryption

266
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,899
I'm not an expert so if you're not an

267
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,300
expert that's good we can talk on the

268
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,160
same level but you know asymmetric

269
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,240
encryption

270
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,920
the idea that you have a private key and

271
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,839
a public key to sort of encrypt and

272
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,080
decrypt things has existed you know the

273
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,240
mathematical formula for it or the

274
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,899
mathematical idea existed since the

275
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,459
um I think the 70s if I remember

276
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,080
correctly and I should remember

277
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,300
correctly I'm giving this talk these

278
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,160
these three gentlemen rivers chamir and

279
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,220
Adelman uh RSA actually

280
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,380
the the conference that's happening in a

281
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,140
couple of days so very timely they

282
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,940
created this this algorithm a long long

283
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,500
time ago

284
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,660
um there were some people who were in

285
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,060
The 90s sort of hypothesizing about the

286
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,500
possibility that something like

287
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,380
ransomware what would happen but it

288
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,640
wasn't until 2006 where we actually saw

289
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,360
the first RSA encrypted ransomware that

290
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,060
was GP code and GP code would arrive at

291
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,420
your machine on a on a document like a a

292
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,760
job sort of offer or something like that

293
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,019
something that would be really really

294
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,060
compelling for you to open especially if

295
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,720
you're jobless and uh you would talk

296
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,579
about praying on the you know on the

297
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,500
week that's a very dirty move but you

298
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,240
would open it up and it would infect

299
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,560
your computer and it would lock your

300
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,440
files with this RSA encryption

301
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,700
um in the beginning it was very very

302
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,160
easy it was very very low bit rate so

303
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,440
people were actually working on trying

304
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,600
to decrypt it and it worked for a while

305
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,279
until

306
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,260
the bit rates went up and and the

307
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,399
encryption became more and more

308
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,620
sophisticated and at some point it just

309
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,240
didn't work anymore you couldn't decrypt

310
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,459
it no matter how much computing power

311
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,519
you had which is uh um you know there's

312
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,560
you could still go and find like these

313
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,360
pages online people trying to pull

314
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,220
together machines just to try and

315
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,860
decrypt this one ransomware

316
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,940
um and at this point in time I think we

317
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,920
all we're all aware I don't it's very

318
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,160
very difficult to in you know in

319
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,260
unencrypt ransomware

320
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,300
um there had been incidents especially

321
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,279
since we're for example in some cases

322
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,320
you would get source code released or

323
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,019
things like that the um the one on the

324
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,820
left there is actually from

325
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,940
um a an issue of virus bulletin from

326
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,440
1989 this is how if you got infected

327
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,899
with the AIDS Trojan you could send them

328
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,720
a letter and then by Mail they'll send

329
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,899
you the uh code or the the floppy this

330
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,360
to actually unencrypt your computer but

331
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,480
that's not a very good solution

332
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,200
um

333
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,480
but that was this sort of the in the

334
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,060
history of ransomware I would say 2006

335
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,279
is when we saw encryption come into its

336
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,500
own and just quickly outpace our ability

337
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,019
to solve the problem

338
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:04,200
so that was encryption that's that's uh

339
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,760
um that's one of those those things

340
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,100
where I feel like it's at this point we

341
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,260
don't we have not not much to do about

342
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,660
the encryption

343
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,920
um

344
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,260
business model so let's talk about the

345
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,180
money P.O box and Panama was just kind

346
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,060
of a wild dream but there are and have

347
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,740
been a lot of different ways where uh

348
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,540
people were trying to monetize on these

349
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,000
uh scams in the earliest days it was

350
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,120
gift cards and prepaid uh debit cards

351
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,160
and sometimes text messages and things

352
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,040
like that this is still a method that um

353
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,899
I don't know works like this is still

354
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,060
something that people do in scams it's

355
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,300
just not really effective and so we've

356
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,100
moved on from that this was these are

357
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,839
some of the screen lockers this is like

358
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,120
something that was done in the 2010s a

359
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,760
little bit earlier a little bit later

360
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,399
um there were electronic currencies this

361
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,320
is something that people had tried to

362
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,079
use there was a problem with that this

363
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,360
was kind of a service online you would

364
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,800
you would put money in there you would

365
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,200
give a code you would get a code and

366
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,260
this was an idea of how to try and

367
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,820
monetize on cyber crime

368
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,700
the problem was is you would get these

369
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,519
organizations your name and details and

370
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,620
as we mentioned earlier that's not a

371
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,860
good idea so people will get caught so

372
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,380
this didn't work and the spoiler of the

373
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,139
year the

374
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:29,160
Bitcoin so Bitcoin in 2013 is when

375
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,959
things sort of clicked into place I

376
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,300
don't think anybody's shocked

377
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,180
um the first uh ransomware the first uh

378
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,459
ransomware I found that uses uh Bitcoin

379
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,680
was crypto Locker

380
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,079
um back in the day to Bitcoins was

381
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,300
around three hundred dollars

382
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,120
so that's that's one of the first

383
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,279
examples of of ransomware using Bitcoin

384
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,660
and and ever since then I think uh the

385
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,740
cryptocurrency has become a big big big

386
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,339
thing in in writing ransomware this is

387
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,160
one of the most effective ways to

388
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,440
monetize and remain

389
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,100
um and remain relatively unknown and so

390
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,360
that was that was a step in the

391
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,399
evolution crypto Locker was a very

392
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,880
interesting uh a very interesting

393
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,720
um

394
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,180
ransomware because it was one of the

395
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,860
first ones to be distributed through

396
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,459
this idea of a banking Trojan combined

397
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,399
with a botnet or or some kind of a you

398
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,800
know delivered through an inside inside

399
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
of a botan and we'll get to that a

400
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,060
little bit later this was a botnet

401
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,880
called his game over Zeus botnet

402
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,639
um led by I'll show you in a little bit

403
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,800
we'll talk about the delivery but

404
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,019
um it was suffice to say it was both

405
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,260
delivered very effectively at the time

406
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,320
um and was very effective at getting

407
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,240
people's money in in the early days

408
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,060
people who were it was mostly

409
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,560
people's computers who are getting

410
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,839
hacked and deliver this it wasn't like

411
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,699
what we know today big organizations

412
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,100
so a little bit about the delivery so we

413
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,079
went we started with these the idea of

414
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,760
floppy disks and uh the sneakernet was

415
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,120
sort of in the 1980s 1990s this is how

416
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,699
people got software over to each other

417
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,639
by walking over to their computer and

418
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:22,139
jamming something in there and I think

419
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,880
the interesting thing that we'll find

420
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,300
where as in with the sort of encryption

421
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,300
and the business model there's kind of a

422
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,300
linear path with the delivery models

423
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,160
you'll find a path throughout history

424
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,139
that is a little bit more parallel and

425
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll show you in a second which is a

426
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,800
little frustrating as well in some ways

427
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,899
but you know nowadays people don't

428
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,880
really use this sneakernet as it were

429
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,740
but you can still walk up to somebody's

430
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,420
computer and jam something in there so

431
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,639
you might as well you could try that to

432
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,800
great effect so it's not like it's gone

433
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,480
completely but this was the main way

434
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,000
people would um would transfer malware

435
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,940
it was to the point where when you look

436
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,500
at some of the

437
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,220
um some magazines from the late 80s

438
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,819
early 90s before the introduction of the

439
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,859
internet some people didn't even believe

440
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,140
that or they believed viruses existed

441
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,780
they just never seen one in action and

442
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,339
most of the viruses back then were just

443
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,980
kind of for fun like they'd make a

444
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,720
little Grandpa walk on your screen or

445
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,459
all sorts of things of course there were

446
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,799
some very interesting viruses that would

447
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,160
um totally destroy your whole day

448
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,760
um

449
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,100
but this talk is not about them

450
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,059
my next talk will be about that uh

451
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,799
so here's here's a couple of things that

452
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,600
were happening ways to deliver malware

453
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,020
in in sort of the late 90s 95 was a

454
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,880
beautiful era for bugs in software

455
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,500
um you know the first thing is you've

456
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,120
got the internet sort of coming up

457
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,179
you've got spam mail that was uh you

458
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:56,520
know spam mail was not a new thing but

459
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,679
spam mail delivered via email was

460
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,020
something was you know a bit new but

461
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,460
this is something that we still see

462
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,020
today

463
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,000
um but in the 90s there was something

464
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,760
interesting Windows 95 came out office

465
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,580
all these softwares are just full of

466
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,640
bugs and vulnerabilities and interesting

467
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,740
ways to exploit them and one of those

468
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,600
interesting ways and I think is is

469
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,880
interesting to note there's

470
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,820
over here there's a Melissa virus it was

471
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,000
uh it was a macro virus in the 90s if

472
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,740
you look at virus bulletin all the big

473
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,320
ones all of the viruses are macro

474
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,600
viruses I was like all the rage what is

475
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,419
a macro macro is sort of an automated uh

476
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,400
function that you create in a Word

477
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,919
document or an Excel document and if

478
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,020
that sounds familiar it's because that's

479
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,720
basically how phishing is done today as

480
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,640
well you have an attachment and you have

481
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
a macro and all that's different

482
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,140
nowadays is you just ask the user to

483
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,240
enable macros and back then it was just

484
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,700
automatic so

485
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,559
um and maybe I'm simplifying a little

486
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,400
bit but a from 95 till today you know

487
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,020
we're still seeing a lot of abusive

488
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,900
macros for example vulnerabilities and

489
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,460
windows vulnerabilities and Flash we

490
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,900
don't have flash today but there's still

491
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,780
vulnerabilities on on online and so in

492
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,760
the 90s that was that was all the rage

493
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,620
and and how you would sort of exploit

494
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,620
and get into people's machines

495
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,360
um

496
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,400
we're gonna just kind of make this a

497
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,900
little short so we have some extra time

498
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,580
for questions but uh one of the uh ways

499
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,160
that I saw a lot in the early 2000s that

500
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,280
were a problem or something that people

501
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,400
I read a lot about is downloading things

502
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,160
the 2000s were sort of this boom of

503
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,980
peer-to-peer downloads and you might

504
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,900
download your favorite Britney Spears

505
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,360
song and as you play it you've realized

506
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,419
this isn't Britney Spears this is uh

507
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:55,799
ransomware and so uh actually no no not

508
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,380
a ransom or maybe a banking Trojan

509
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,100
um but uh that was something that that's

510
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,080
obviously something that's still going

511
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,780
on today and um

512
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,340
I was one of the things that I've read

513
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,140
about a lot so downloading things is

514
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,940
something that was a big problem in

515
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,000
early 2000s here's another thing and I

516
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,120
said I'll uh talk about this when I

517
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,039
talked about crypto Locker Trojans and

518
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,880
botnets and around the two 2010s or a

519
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,140
sort of through the history of

520
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,580
ransomware were a great way of

521
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:29,520
delivering ransomware banking Trojans

522
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,520
were used to sort of create the sort of

523
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,700
infection and then either the machine

524
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,760
would join a botnet and then delivered

525
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,380
the ransomware or they would use another

526
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,900
another payload to then spread through

527
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,299
the network

528
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:47,280
and or spread through a corporate

529
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,480
Network or spread through whatever

530
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,760
Network and then deliver a ransomware so

531
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,880
this was really around the time 2013

532
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,220
where ransomware became a really big

533
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,059
problem and sort of started growing

534
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:01,500
two prominent example of that from

535
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,799
around that time was game over Zeus

536
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:06,720
which was a botnet that was used to

537
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,320
deliver crypto locker and emotech which

538
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,760
was a

539
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,539
there was a famous emotech trickbot ryuk

540
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,320
or emoted insert another payload here

541
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,780
insert another ransomware here

542
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,120
um this these two pipelines were kind of

543
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,780
the two big ones at the time and uh you

544
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,880
know the way they operated was pretty

545
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,679
simple and why they worked this way was

546
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,840
pretty simple because kind of layering

547
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,120
all these things together from all these

548
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,679
vulnerabilities from the 90s when you

549
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,120
think about getting getting people

550
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,580
infected via phishing email or spam

551
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,760
email then using a maybe a document that

552
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,860
had a macro on it and some social

553
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,960
engineering to get something to run on a

554
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
machine you get that you use that macro

555
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,480
to download a payload let's say emo chat

556
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,440
and emotec then establishes persistence

557
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,700
or something like that and then

558
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,620
downloads another payload and in this

559
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,380
case this specific graphic would be

560
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,080
trickbot and then trickbot was another

561
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,179
type of Trojan would then spread through

562
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,100
the network and then you can eventually

563
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,799
get yourself a lot of different targets

564
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,799
for for ransomer and so that was that

565
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,780
was a big a big part of the delivery and

566
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,860
I think one of the interesting things uh

567
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,659
that I'm getting to

568
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,360
oh yeah this guy so this is this is the

569
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,179
guy behind Zeus uh game game over Zeus

570
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,919
Network it was he's a pretty famous

571
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,880
cyber criminal his name is evgeny

572
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,280
borgachev or Slavic or lucky one two

573
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,620
three four five six seven

574
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,419
um this is the dude that created it this

575
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,760
is the biggest collab between crypto

576
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,940
locker and game over Zeus he made a ton

577
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,280
of money bought a cat and a cat suit and

578
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,000
just disappeared

579
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,320
yeah I mean big difference when you

580
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,240
think all the way back to Joseph alpope

581
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,059
and to this guy which they haven't

582
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,100
caught yet

583
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,299
um

584
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,120
we can see how how we've made a or

585
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,559
they've made some some huge progress

586
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:13,140
so all of this together Trojans button

587
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,400
it's nowadays we're dealing with

588
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,740
multi-stage attacks and when you look at

589
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,960
multi-stage attacks

590
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,120
um it usually starts with something like

591
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,120
spam like a phishing email it will

592
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,559
continue to spread through the network

593
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,900
with maybe a Trojan or something like

594
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,360
that and eventually as it spreads

595
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,059
through the network network

596
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:35,400
eventually maybe drop a ransomware on

597
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,900
your machine so there's a lot of

598
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,240
different capabilities from this entire

599
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,919
history of the delivery of rent

600
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,960
somewhere that's being used still being

601
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,720
used today and I there's not a single

602
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,659
technique that I've mentioned

603
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,159
within that history of delivery that

604
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,960
isn't actively being used today maybe

605
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,159
physical hacking is is less prominent

606
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,720
um and that's that's something

607
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,280
interesting about the history of of

608
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,620
ransomer so I've got this one minute

609
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,260
card in front of me

610
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,200
so uh that means I'm I'm done with this

611
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,760
uh talk right now I hope this was

612
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,100
interesting uh and I think we're opening

613
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,200
this up for questions right

614
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,320
sorry we're out of time for questions

615
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,580
thank you so much come

616
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,360
thank you
