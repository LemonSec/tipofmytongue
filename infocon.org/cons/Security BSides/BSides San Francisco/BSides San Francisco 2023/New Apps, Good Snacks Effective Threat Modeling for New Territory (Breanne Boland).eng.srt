1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,520
all right everyone hope you guys are

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,780
here to

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,580
visit Brienne and see what she has to

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,820
talk about today Brienne take it away

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,500
all right

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,559
hey good afternoon I'm so glad you're

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:14,519
all here

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,220
uh for the next 25-ish minutes we are

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,440
going to talk about threat modeling

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,760
um and we're going to make it cute as

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,119
you can see

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,900
as an introduction my name is Brianne

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,340
Boland I work in product security at

14
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,320
Gusto I really like threat modeling in

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,420
part because it puts structured thinking

16
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,880
and a salary on top of my natural

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,160
paranoia and Imagination and that makes

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,020
me very happy I also write a lot of

19
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,520
fiction which I think uses a lot of the

20
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,540
same skills of just kind of looking

21
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,140
around corners and at a human element I

22
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,160
am currently taking a stained glass

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,440
class it is a blast although um

24
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,180
soldering stained glass and soldering

25
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,700
circuit boards very different motions

26
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,620
and artists will laugh at you a little

27
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,180
bit when you adapt

28
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,920
this is me after visiting the Canadian

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,420
embassy at the Toronto Airport last

30
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,539
month

31
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,800
we're going to talk about we are going

32
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,539
to look into the past of our fictional

33
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,519
product look at the advice we've

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,740
previously given our engineering team

35
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,780
because we are all now the product

36
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,280
security team together by the way it's

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,740
you're deputized it's happening today

38
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,119
and then we're going to look forward at

39
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,619
a very new and different feature that

40
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,720
they are proposing which requires us to

41
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,060
stop the gentle complacency that can

42
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,799
creep in if you get used to things and

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,500
look at things a little differently

44
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,119
and then at the end we're going to talk

45
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,799
about how to relate this stuff usefully

46
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,180
to the people that need to hear it

47
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,460
a useful note philosophically

48
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,140
there is security that sometimes has to

49
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,060
demand this is security that is more

50
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,920
about suggesting we are advising not

51
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,259
dictating we are here to make friends

52
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,900
and keep them ideally so we want to

53
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,159
suggest rather than just telling people

54
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,560
what their business is it also happens

55
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,060
to be the philosophy of security at the

56
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,380
company I work at which is part of why I

57
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,640
took the job

58
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,140
so we want to point out risk and offer

59
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,020
mitigations and we pop in in a

60
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,220
consultative way rather than being

61
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,899
consistently embedded or making a bunch

62
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,100
of Demands of people all the time

63
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,540
so let's talk our product

64
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,119
we work for a wildly popular snack

65
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,540
loyalty app called snack tracker and the

66
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,099
new product they're looking to debut is

67
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,080
called snack Adder because I guess

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,520
there's a Rowan Atkinson fan and product

69
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,800
which we love to see

70
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,680
so snack tracker offers snack tracking

71
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,120
and a rewards website but they want to

72
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,099
go bigger we've had a popular app for a

73
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,319
long time both mobile and web and we

74
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,940
want to partner with fine snack shops

75
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,500
across our test region to have in-person

76
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,239
check-ins and bonuses adding an extra

77
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,560
Dimension to the experience that just

78
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,360
wasn't there before

79
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,940
what we want to do is have tablets of

80
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,980
some kind specifics not determined yet

81
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,140
where users can go and they can logs

82
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,879
next to their wish lists they can check

83
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,440
into specific locations they can get big

84
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,239
rewards at special events something that

85
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,340
hasn't been possible till now

86
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,019
we have previously expanded existing

87
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,099
features but it's been a while since

88
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,019
we've had something completely new and

89
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,459
both product and security teams can be

90
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,319
used to things and it's time for us to

91
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,599
break out

92
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,980
to give you a sense of context of where

93
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,120
we're coming from

94
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,680
up until now there have been two kinds

95
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,720
of users there are shop owners and there

96
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,099
are snack fiends

97
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,900
shop owners need to see customer details

98
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,000
snack Trends and reviews and cash out

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,280
loyalty points snack fiends however need

100
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,659
to see their account details and point

101
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,760
balances learn about events enter and

102
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,440
update their snack preferences and

103
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,480
adjust communication details yeah pretty

104
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,620
normal stuff

105
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,720
both types of users logged into the same

106
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,760
mobile and web apps any differences came

107
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,440
from authorization after they were

108
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,940
logged in

109
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,739
so our challenge is that all previous

110
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,360
threat modeling and security guidelines

111
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,680
were done in the context of this

112
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,940
specific use

113
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,159
you could depend on things like users

114
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,780
entered their username and they're

115
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,019
definitely long random used only once

116
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,519
passwords because our users are the best

117
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,780
people in the world because this is my

118
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,080
story and it can be that way foreign

119
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,060
and that meant that only one maybe two

120
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,440
users would use a single device ever

121
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,959
which made things like convincing people

122
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,659
to do MFA easy those snack points are

123
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,700
popular and we also bribed people with

124
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,459
bonus points for setting it up

125
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,739
the way we approached it before sessions

126
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,000
for snack fiends if they checked they

127
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,159
were on a private device lasted up to a

128
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,959
month and this was easy because it was

129
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,000
only on their own device no sharing

130
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,560
shop owners it was a little less we did

131
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,360
kind of more of a like Bank credit card

132
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,399
model because there's transactions going

133
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,139
on there so we logged them out after a

134
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,540
minute or two of an activity

135
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,880
and it's useful to remember snack fiends

136
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,080
are not used to needing to log out after

137
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,460
app use and that's something we're going

138
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,180
to have to account for

139
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,620
looking forward though

140
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,560
the in-person team is super psyched they

141
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,060
want a simpler way for users to check in

142
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,100
at this in-person shared device that

143
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,960
doesn't involve those long complex

144
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,240
beautiful passwords in the MFA we've

145
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,280
previously previously pushed them into

146
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,540
instead the user is only going to

147
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,800
interact with the tablet for like a

148
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,100
minute maybe less so enter snack adder

149
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,560
the users the snack fiends went to log

150
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,960
snacks and get rewards the shop owners

151
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
want to allow the customers to log

152
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
snacks and also not have more work or a

153
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,120
new vulnerability to worry about

154
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,680
so our goal is to offer actionable

155
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,479
security advice to a product team that

156
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,100
is excited to move fast we want to

157
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,199
protect our users and their data and we

158
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,060
also want the product team to want to

159
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,199
talk to us after this is all over

160
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
let's look at the advice we've given

161
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,660
them before

162
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,040
and then aside if you haven't bumped

163
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,720
into threat modeling it's a good day

164
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,560
because you're about to learn something

165
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
really cool

166
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,160
and it's core it's just an organized way

167
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,139
of examining something you know feature

168
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,539
product system situation and looking at

169
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,460
where risk might occur we look for

170
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,720
opportunities where vulnerabilities

171
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,820
could be exploited we want to quantify

172
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,199
what we find so that it's understandable

173
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,419
and actionable and then we want to offer

174
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,740
assessments and guidance to those

175
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,060
responsible for what's being evaluated

176
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,440
so they can make things better for our

177
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,240
users

178
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,699
there are lots of good threat modeling

179
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,199
Frameworks out there and lots of

180
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,120
opinions about them if you haven't dug

181
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,759
into it before look up stride pasta

182
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,740
miter attack if you want to get a sense

183
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,060
of how big the world is and what you

184
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,080
don't know yet

185
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,220
for us though we're going to do a little

186
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,360
more informally and just kind of look

187
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,560
piece by piece of what we're dealing

188
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,680
with

189
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,240
tales of the past what have we told them

190
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,120
about web and mobile app stuff and past

191
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,320
context matters when you're working with

192
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,699
the same Engineers across time because

193
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,560
you get the chance to either give them

194
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,180
deeper knowledge when you're bringing up

195
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,440
something familiar again or point out

196
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,520
that there's something completely new

197
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,199
coming up

198
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,039
um so if you get to build those

199
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,139
relationships a little bit of depth gets

200
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,819
to emergency do that

201
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:25,860
so in our case some of the engineers

202
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,300
there are familiar with our people we've

203
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,259
worked with they've brought some new

204
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,180
folks in for this new initiative too

205
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,380
so this is something that we would ask

206
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,759
them to review anyway

207
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,699
so like encryption we give the usual

208
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,560
advice you know encrypt things in trans

209
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,319
and arrest use a good like current

210
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
industry standard encryption Cipher and

211
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,919
for this because we're a good

212
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,600
full-service security team we point to

213
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,400
our robust library of available

214
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,139
knowledge and we say hey check this out

215
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,060
we keep this up to date for you we

216
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,740
updated every six months or as necessary

217
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,300
whichever comes first

218
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,780
and it lets people stay on top of things

219
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,180
authentication similar uh as it happens

220
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,740
at snack tracker we have an

221
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,940
authentication team because we are

222
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,979
blessed and we're able to say hey just

223
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,300
talk to them about what we have been

224
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,220
doing lately just do that there are

225
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,020
great things to innovate on we recommend

226
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,000
for this just going with it because we

227
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,039
trust our team

228
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,900
authorization

229
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,580
you know along with just having certain

230
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,199
actions attached to the user we also

231
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,720
want to make sure that in code you know

232
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,340
connected to uh

233
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,960
you know different functions they might

234
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,940
access that they're allowed to do that

235
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,620
um

236
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,840
sessions as I said not too short not too

237
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,099
long varying depending on the function

238
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:33,840
that's actually going on there

239
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,419
uh for user info things like please use

240
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,580
uuids rather than anything sequential

241
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,440
that you can enumerate or possibly Brute

242
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,880
Force

243
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,319
um you know scope usually either

244
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,400
permissions appropriately for both

245
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
regular users and admins

246
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,300
going to secure libraries you know going

247
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,860
back to that robust Library

248
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,440
recommendations we say please if you can

249
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,880
go and pick something off the menu there

250
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,520
if not we'll dig into it for you

251
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,780
and we also of course mandate

252
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,759
user-dependabot because uh we like

253
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,180
ourselves

254
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,380
privacy concerns

255
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,099
um

256
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:08,099
so we have a really wonderful tight

257
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,039
relationship with the legal team I like

258
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,479
them because they are word-based

259
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,460
organisms which I also am

260
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,860
but we also have a lot in common so it

261
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,880
makes more sense if we work really

262
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,099
tightly together and as a result we're a

263
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,300
security team that can give some

264
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,220
guidance around the laws of various

265
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,660
states and countries things around data

266
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,160
retention what you should do

267
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,840
you know deeper questions we're like you

268
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,879
should go talk to a lawyer about that

269
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,159
but for this we also push a very

270
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,839
specific philosophy of data which is

271
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,880
please do not ask for it please do not

272
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
store it if we do not actually need it

273
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,159
does it pertain to snacks no don't ask

274
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,899
so in this case do we care about

275
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,339
someone's gender if they just want to

276
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,980
snack I certainly hope not so if we

277
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,600
don't need it don't request it and we

278
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,500
don't have to worry about it

279
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,779
but let's look to the Future

280
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,000
going back to that last question so how

281
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,740
little data can we collect with this

282
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,540
particular feature

283
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,120
and in ways this is better and easier

284
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,220
because the scope of it is going to be

285
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,860
so much less there are going to be a

286
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,660
really limited number of actions that a

287
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,920
user can take within what they're

288
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,360
proposing

289
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,500
and it does give one interesting

290
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,019
opportunity so because we have a very

291
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,360
healthy respect for our snack fiends we

292
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,860
have never collected location data

293
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,480
before we just didn't want to get it off

294
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,279
their mobile Device just because it

295
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,480
makes us feel funny and we don't like

296
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,540
that however if someone opts into using

297
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,820
a device that's tied to location that's

298
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,500
very different so we have the

299
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,940
opportunity to collect geographical

300
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,279
information when people do check-ins

301
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,500
other than that though because this is

302
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,300
so pared down there are much less

303
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,820
concerns

304
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,260
next up and this is one of the big

305
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,880
interesting questions here

306
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,680
how is authentication going to work if

307
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,940
they don't want to use something that is

308
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,100
so similar to you know everything else

309
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,480
everything that this company has ever

310
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,339
done

311
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,220
and we like encouraging developer teams

312
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,440
to do new things we like Innovation it's

313
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,120
great but we want to make sure they're

314
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,180
imagining in the good way and not going

315
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,440
toward things that we just don't want to

316
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,820
invite in the house

317
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,500
so in this case what kind of credential

318
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,779
or login method is appropriate for

319
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,459
one-time use without a user session that

320
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,740
persists we're not expecting people to

321
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,600
type in their long unique passwords on

322
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,279
an unfamiliar device when a line of

323
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,720
frantic snack fiends is developing

324
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,300
behind you as some of you might relate

325
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,620
to with what you just experienced in the

326
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,660
hallway because conferences

327
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,120
so what are we going to do instead

328
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,680
so one option that's proposed by our

329
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,540
team who are wonderful enough to come up

330
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,459
with ideas and bring them to us what

331
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:33,720
about a pin

332
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,760
what if it's only used for this specific

333
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,899
thing you couldn't enter it as a

334
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,519
password you can just enter a pin and

335
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,959
you know people have a context for it

336
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,240
with phones with ATMs they'll go right

337
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,200
with it

338
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,560
and we say yeah it's thank you for

339
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,940
suggesting that's a very interesting

340
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,320
idea

341
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,480
ultimately we decide like we'll keep it

342
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,339
in mind we want to stay open

343
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,360
but security feels a little queasy about

344
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,279
making an equivalence between a even six

345
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,560
or eight digit PIN in a proper password

346
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,000
so we're like yeah you know thank you

347
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,380
for thinking of that uh what else do you

348
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,339
have

349
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:07,860
and the next idea they bring also

350
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,079
interesting uh meaning that in a good

351
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,339
way

352
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,140
I've seen this call I haven't I haven't

353
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,820
seen a really specific consistent term

354
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,079
for it so I'm going to call it second

355
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,660
screen authentication if you know a term

356
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,160
that everyone knows for it I want you to

357
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,360
come and tell me because I've had

358
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,519
fruitless Googling around this this is

359
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,200
the kind of authentication where

360
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,540
on one device you have you know an

361
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,640
existing authenticated session and you

362
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,399
want to log in on say your TV on a

363
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,720
streaming service and you don't want to

364
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,860
put your password in using a remote

365
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,240
control because we only have so many

366
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,620
hours in the day

367
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,120
so instead what you do is give it your

368
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,100
user ID it gives you a short code six

369
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,779
letters is what I've usually seen you

370
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,279
enter into an authenticated session and

371
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,800
hey it's Hulu wonderful

372
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,940
and we're like yeah that's that's

373
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,200
interesting people have the context for

374
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,339
that people are getting used to that

375
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,800
it's definitely shorter

376
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,300
and that establishes like a different

377
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,380
kind of session that's happening there's

378
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,839
a paradigm for this cool cool right

379
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,220
so we consider that like that is a

380
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,660
decent suggestion

381
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,240
but our product team loves us and they

382
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,560
have another option

383
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,060
and they say

384
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,279
what about a QR code

385
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,300
and they explain that what they're

386
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,980
picturing is a

387
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,779
you know and they they can predict some

388
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,700
of our our arguments they're like it'll

389
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,019
be dynamically generated it won't be

390
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:17,399
static all the time not easy to share

391
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,440
it'll be unique to a person and they

392
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,760
generate it on their device and just go

393
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,519
Boop and they're in

394
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,779
and so we think about that and

395
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,779
considering the level of uh State change

396
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,240
happening here the data involved this

397
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,760
could be a good thing so officially we

398
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,200
say we'll go off and think about that

399
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,700
but what we're really going to do is go

400
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,640
and further refine our existing guidance

401
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,560
around things like sanitizing input just

402
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,720
to educate our team about the weird

403
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,279
sneaky stuff that can be stuck in QR

404
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,459
codes

405
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,480
foreign

406
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,560
then there's the question of

407
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,380
authorization and that's really key here

408
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,240
because the whole thing revolves around

409
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
a scope down set of operations

410
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,320
and this gets interesting to you because

411
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,700
roles and permissions are often really

412
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,079
foundational in a product you know

413
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,700
they're innate to an MVP like literally

414
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,980
what can people do here

415
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,920
but the ownership of it and sometimes

416
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,480
the fragility of code can mean that

417
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,940
later on it gets really weird to change

418
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,440
stuff and there are a couple ways this

419
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,720
can exist one is that um

420
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,519
either people are very protective

421
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,500
reasonably or otherwise it's not easy to

422
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,760
make changes and so it becomes kind of

423
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,019
calcified and people have to work around

424
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:24,420
it in weird ways not ideal

425
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,639
the other version is that it is too easy

426
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,500
to change things and that means you end

427
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,300
up with this big like chaos Katamari

428
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,820
ball of things that the original role

429
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,440
designers did not intend and did not

430
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,820
foresee

431
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,980
and across time you can have really

432
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,839
weird side effects like you know hitting

433
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,060
up a certain API endpoint and going I

434
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,500
did not ask for this and who is this

435
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,339
person's medical information

436
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,360
so the recommended approach that we end

437
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,760
up coming up with in part because we

438
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,380
don't want to just do unnecessary edits

439
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,540
to the existing permissions is to think

440
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,440
of it

441
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,760
like

442
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,680
third-party integration

443
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,240
where you give an API key you know think

444
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
like a GitHub personal access token your

445
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,079
account might have all these permissions

446
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,600
but the token might have this one and so

447
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,339
that's what we're doing here that's what

448
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,480
we encourage the team to do and we're

449
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,100
talking to them fairly early no code has

450
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,300
been written yet so we can be kind of

451
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,980
high level about this and be like yeah

452
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,540
come back and tell me exactly how you

453
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,600
implement that I would love to see it

454
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,820
so in this case it would allow admin

455
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,620
functions just saying like you are

456
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,660
authorized to say I belong to this place

457
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,760
people can log into the store within

458
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,079
this session

459
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,940
and then it will do one-off operations

460
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,920
for users who connect to the store

461
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,519
through that device

462
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,480
there's also the question then of how to

463
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,060
invalidate it

464
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,300
the snack shop owner situation gets

465
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,680
interesting because like a lot of small

466
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,720
businesses the owner is not necessarily

467
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,519
there every day and they definitely

468
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,959
don't necessarily want to give an admin

469
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,220
level password to someone who maybe

470
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,320
works there 10 hours a week

471
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,820
so the compromise that we reach is we

472
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,220
say hey yeah this session can be two

473
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,839
weeks and if you find that's not long

474
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,100
enough and people still need more than

475
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,839
that come back and we'll talk and we'll

476
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,100
look at your user research and see what

477
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,800
we can reasonably recommend

478
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,660
but it flips though with the snack

479
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,820
fiends that instead we say we want this

480
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,220
to be limited to a single operation they

481
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,380
Boop and then they log one snack they

482
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,000
Boop and they check in once and that's

483
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,180
it

484
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,860
and also we recommend uh by the way we

485
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,540
need to have it possible to revoke this

486
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,639
tablet session in case that tablet grows

487
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,000
legs

488
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,339
so then there's the question of asking

489
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:30,959
them to drill down more into what the

490
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,600
state changes can be things like

491
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,060
for the snack fiend password changes

492
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,380
redemptions and points because that

493
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,760
requires a cashier stuff like that

494
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,440
totally off limits

495
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,240
it's only just here's my account I want

496
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,500
to do a check-in or an activity that

497
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,779
gets me points I want this new very

498
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,480
exotic flavor of Hot Cheetos that's what

499
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,899
we're gonna do

500
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,339
and then there's the physical context

501
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:55,139
which historically we mostly haven't had

502
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,760
to worry about

503
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,380
because unlike the current shop owner

504
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,720
use instead of the uh the admin level

505
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,399
device being right in front of them it

506
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,019
might be across the store behind a giant

507
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,399
display of cookies it might be out of

508
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,300
sight because it doesn't require

509
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,160
attending

510
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,100
so then what are our expectations for

511
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,199
putting it in place for initial setup

512
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,760
the shop owners aren't necessarily there

513
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,040
every day and we really can't in the way

514
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,660
of small businesses expect a dedicated

515
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,240
technical staff I suspect a lot of

516
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,220
people in this room have been the go-to

517
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,800
dedicated technical contact for some of

518
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,959
your friends and relatives that's the

519
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,820
best we can expect is someone like us

520
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,519
just being drawn in

521
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,459
so we need to keep it pretty simple and

522
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,079
it becomes more and more in our interest

523
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,399
to offer some security guidance because

524
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,540
the folks that are involved in doing

525
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,399
this stuff probably aren't familiar with

526
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,880
a lot of that

527
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,600
then there's the question of what this

528
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,839
thing's actually going to be

529
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,420
in the way of product folks who've been

530
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,519
talking to marketing our team comes to

531
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,199
us with really big Ideas they say words

532
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,779
like custom form factor

533
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,360
which feels bad to hear they say what if

534
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,980
we got into device manufacturing what if

535
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,160
there was branding it could be immersive

536
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,540
yeah it's a whole experience and they

537
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,220
start using

538
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,380
um nice big lofty high level words and

539
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,939
that's when we start going the mean

540
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,220
that's a very I'm writing this down it's

541
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,140
a very interesting idea but we want to

542
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,220
be encouraging

543
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,660
so what we do is listen to what they

544
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,699
want to do and then Scurry off and Talk

545
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,140
Amongst ourselves

546
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,459
and in this case we decide pretty

547
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,480
quickly

548
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,040
we do not want to be in the business of

549
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,079
device manufacturing we are in the

550
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,140
business of uh recording details about

551
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,120
chips that's a very different thing and

552
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,380
we're not we don't think we're ready yet

553
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,940
however this is the kind of

554
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,820
recommendation I would escalate pretty

555
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,220
pretty highly before I actually said

556
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,500
anything like that because maybe who

557
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,720
knows in some two years ahead of us plan

558
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,100
there is something that says like you

559
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,660
know what we need to do is like custom

560
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,700
tablets for the chip people

561
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,919
so what I would do is go talk to my

562
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,900
manager and probably also go say hello

563
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,120
to RC so just to say hey I heard this

564
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,580
I'm not married to a feeling either way

565
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,440
yet but like tell me what you think

566
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,820
about this

567
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,520
and in the case of our story I get a

568
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,460
nice wide-eyed long couple seconds of

569
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,140
Silence before getting confirmation that

570
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,000
no we don't want to do that because

571
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,799
manufacturing devices is a completely

572
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,299
different kettle of fish that is not a

573
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:16,799
snack that our snack fiends are eager

574
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,760
for

575
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,440
and it also would require hiring for

576
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,360
skills we've never had to hire for in

577
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,559
order to do this even vaguely

578
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,059
effectively

579
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,880
so this becomes in the way of ranking

580
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,220
recommendations kind of

581
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,860
I'm afraid I must insist on this uh

582
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,360
we'll call it a do-level recommendation

583
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,039
compared to try and consider

584
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,720
um so fortunately we've all agreed over

585
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,400
insecurity we don't want to get into the

586
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,480
business of specialized device

587
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,299
manufacturer

588
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,860
we as a security team go off and have a

589
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,539
sigh of relief and maybe just go have a

590
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:49,980
nice fizzy beverage to commemorate that

591
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,240
our lives aren't getting that much worse

592
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,559
today

593
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,460
say is hey what we could do we could

594
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,080
offer security guidance to shop owners

595
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,720
for choosing the device for equipping it

596
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,660
definitely for keeping it up to date

597
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,260
um

598
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,120
providing them security advisories that

599
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,799
they might not encounter in the weight

600
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,600
of their regular business

601
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,820
especially because we can definitely

602
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,640
expect some secondhand device use in the

603
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,020
mix in the way of people being

604
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,559
resourceful

605
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,640
all right so we've got some initial

606
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,900
recommendations for what our product

607
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,400
team is proposing

608
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,260
how do we explain it effectively

609
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,940
there are a few ways one of the ones I

610
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,520
really like to be good on is uh having

611
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,919
very very clear and as concise as

612
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,600
possible recommendations in a written

613
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,820
form this is worth spending some time on

614
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,160
and doing a few drafts if you are not

615
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,960
thrilled about this work which is valid

616
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,179
give it a shot and then reach out to

617
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,100
someone maybe on your team even better

618
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,780
someone who's kind of like the sort of

619
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,860
people you're trying to reach with this

620
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,539
stuff to get them to look it over and

621
00:19:51,539 --> 00:19:53,880
say Hey you hit it or just like yeah

622
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,740
this paragraph I read it and I don't

623
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,940
actually know what you want me to do I

624
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,640
just think you're kind of mad at me

625
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,200
so get that second opinion just keep

626
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,299
refining and just remember like it's a

627
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,679
skill like anything else it takes time

628
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,600
to really nail it

629
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,340
it's also useful just whenever you can

630
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,840
to ground things in really specific

631
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
security principles this gives us

632
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,799
consistency across time which is super

633
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,919
useful but also when you work with teams

634
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,600
a lot they will start to be able to get

635
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,679
a sense of what you're going to say

636
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,539
before you say it and do preventative

637
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,220
work to answer your questions before you

638
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,880
raise them and this is the best thing

639
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,919
and to cultivate that it is useful to

640
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,900
offer some knowledge to people it

641
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,919
doesn't have to be exhaustive it can

642
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,419
just be a link at the end going hey man

643
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,100
if you want to know more about this you

644
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,780
might really enjoy this blog post from a

645
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,860
couple of years ago that explains it

646
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,640
well

647
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,679
this is a favorite of mine because it is

648
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,059
a big part of how I became a security

649
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,740
engineer

650
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,120
um getting to read more stuff that

651
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,860
connected somewhat to the work I was

652
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,840
doing but added new depth and explained

653
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,400
what the you know co-workers I really

654
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,520
liked her out to Super useful and uh

655
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,720
also really good for the relationship

656
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,960
building

657
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,160
beyond that

658
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,140
I am afraid I'm here to tell you that

659
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,220
sometimes you need to go to more

660
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,960
meetings

661
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,700
but some of them are good actually and

662
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,799
some of them are necessary meetings are

663
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,600
good when relaying your recommendations

664
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,820
if it's a team you're not familiar with

665
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,140
and you don't know yet how they're going

666
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,360
to react it's really good to be there to

667
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,580
see the the misconceptions come into

668
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,140
place and get ahead of them just kind of

669
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,240
like throw yourself in front of it

670
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,860
it also keeps you from relaying on

671
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,020
third-party versions of what you sent

672
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,240
over people like to read and interpret

673
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,620
and it ends up in a game of tech

674
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,020
telephone and that is very painful and

675
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,520
we can avoid it in part

676
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,200
by showing up you don't have to do it

677
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,340
all the time but just especially when

678
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,780
initiating relationships it's a really

679
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,860
good idea just to have it be a

680
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,880
conversation

681
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,620
but of course make sure your

682
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,760
recommendations stand on their own too

683
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,320
because they are going to persist so

684
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,860
much longer

685
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,600
it is also useful to maintain a

686
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,120
philosophy of offering help that we are

687
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,059
here to assist and not to prohibit we

688
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:55,440
are there to enable people to do their

689
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,080
jobs and not have sad times

690
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,760
um we're trying to make their lives

691
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,140
better and their products and we

692
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,760
actually are allies even if sometimes

693
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,200
people don't feel like it or they've had

694
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,179
days at other jobs where that actually

695
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,400
wasn't the case we can do some good by

696
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,400
healing things over a little bit

697
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,280
and finally ask

698
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,620
for feedback a lot ask for it in

699
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,299
different forms here is my survey link

700
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,520
here is where you should DM me here is

701
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,520
the official feedback form here is uh

702
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,840
what I want to know about in particular

703
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,700
I tried this thing can you tell me if it

704
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,380
worked for you if not you have any ideas

705
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,179
about what would work better the more

706
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:31,559
you ask for it the more people will

707
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,179
believe that you actually mean it and

708
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,100
across time you will get a steady flow

709
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,480
of more information

710
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,700
so keep soliciting it it's how we get

711
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,039
better it can feel funny but it's great

712
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,220
actually

713
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,320
finally

714
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,059
is for you

715
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,100
push against complacency it is a lot

716
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,659
easier to do it if you're doing it

717
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,419
regularly instead of just when you see

718
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:55,740
something completely new and go like oh

719
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,000
yeah I need to shift my brain into

720
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,500
something different

721
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,120
the more you can try to cultivate

722
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,280
beginner's mind you know treat every new

723
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,659
feature like you're first Falling in

724
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:04,440
Love

725
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,059
it's useful and it's better to cultivate

726
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,380
it as a habit rather than having to

727
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,059
massively course correct after you've

728
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:12,260
really become entrenched in something

729
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:14,400
try to

730
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,720
you know just try creative things to

731
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,460
explain things well you know that can be

732
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,620
that really good concise description of

733
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,780
what you need I like metaphors that's

734
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,820
not everyone's strength but it's useful

735
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,960
to be able to cycle through a couple

736
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,280
comparisons of things and then see

737
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,600
someone's eyes light up as you see them

738
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,940
get it super gratifying and it works

739
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,419
really well

740
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,320
when you're relaying stuff

741
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,240
try to cut the noise reduce things as

742
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,260
much as you can so that it's

743
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,179
straightforward reads easy and there's

744
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,559
no question about what you're asking

745
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,080
people to do

746
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,400
and make it clear when you're talking to

747
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,960
people that you actually are here to

748
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,000
encourage their cool ambitious technical

749
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,100
work rather than be an obstacle we're

750
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,360
not just here to penalize things with

751
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,919
heavier overhead we're just here to make

752
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,000
sure that they can actually do the

753
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,460
things they want and not have it cause a

754
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,340
terrible week six months in the future

755
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,960
and finally

756
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,760
ask the people you serve how you can do

757
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,460
better over and over and mean it every

758
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,380
time

759
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,159
thank you very much

760
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,640
thank you

761
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,740
[Applause]

762
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,299
folks we have a little bit of wiggle

763
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,100
room if you have questions for bran we

764
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,299
have maybe one or two questions

765
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,860
and some test tickets am I going to the

766
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,080
wrong direction or like recommendation

767
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,260
properties you know

768
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,240
okay the question was about once you've

769
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,340
formulated your recommendations

770
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,260
and correct me if I'm wrong if they're

771
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,580
just being put into jira tickets is that

772
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,720
the wrong direction for actually getting

773
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,200
them adopted that did that

774
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,820
no it's part of the right direction for

775
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,659
sure

776
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:05,100
um things do need to be tracked if you

777
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,480
just put something in like a Google doc

778
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,919
or a Confluence page it's a great way to

779
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,840
never see it again so I like the

780
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,039
combination of like I've written

781
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,900
something for you and it is connected to

782
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,179
these tickets so that they actually

783
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,200
offer some kind of accountability and

784
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,760
usually a deadline and you can assign it

785
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,500
to someone so no they're actually

786
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,840
incredibly useful if you're a tiny

787
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,039
company you can probably get away with

788
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,779
just like I have crafted for you this

789
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,220
finest report it will definitely do

790
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,260
everything that I want but if you're

791
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,880
more than about five people like yeah

792
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,260
you went somewhere Central to track all

793
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,820
that stuff and just do a lot of linking

794
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,919
back and forth

795
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,700
yeah thanks

796
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,159
any other questions feel free to raise

797
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,960
your hand I'll walk up with a mic if you

798
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,240
can speak louder

799
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,380
okay

800
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,419
uh yeah how can you make sure that

801
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:49,620
you're one of the things that you're

802
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,539
talking about is when you're going to

803
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,059
meetings to explain the recommendations

804
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,220
that you're making how can you make sure

805
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,020
that you're included on those meetings

806
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,539
rather those are happening without

807
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:01,919
it okay yeah the question was those

808
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,720
meetings to follow up on things how do

809
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,799
you make sure you're actually included

810
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,720
in them instead of them happening when

811
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,100
you don't know

812
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,200
um part of it is uh being a ruthless

813
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,140
stalker of calendars it's not my

814
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,240
favorite method but it is one way just

815
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,500
if you know certain people that are

816
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,539
going to be involved in it yeah be a

817
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,720
giant Google Calendar creep it is useful

818
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,279
um it's not the softest method but it

819
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,600
will get your answers

820
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,279
beyond that just like having those

821
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,840
regular conversations and checking in

822
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,279
saying like I actually do care about

823
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,100
this hey please involve me generally you

824
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,600
can ask too many times and be ignored

825
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,580
without the other person looking kind of

826
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,100
awful so neither of these things is 100

827
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,080
but together they end up covering a lot

828
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,919
of it

829
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:42,480
you know the other thing is that a lot

830
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,820
of this you know you in my experience

831
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,260
I've had conversations with the folks

832
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,760
involved across time it's how I knew

833
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,500
they had anything to review

834
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,320
so we just stay conversational and you

835
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,240
know I put extra effort into like making

836
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,820
it a bubbly candy colored experience

837
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,980
sometimes people respond well to it and

838
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,120
it lets you get actual security work

839
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,380
done too

840
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,860

843
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,380

845
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,379
authentication flow

846
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,279
now the talk is officially worth it

847
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,700
thank you it's really bothered me

848
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,740
