1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,340
hello everyone I'm Nick um and this is

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,259
my co-presenter Aiden and the talk we're

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,940
giving today is catching some fishermen

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,319
or a fisherman I don't know what's in

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:08,580
the program

6
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,139
um just a little disclaimer for this

7
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,580
presentation which is very fitting for a

8
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,540
theater

9
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,759
but um everything we're going to be

10
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,900
talking about

11
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,500
uh is inspired by a real investigation

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,380
but has been anonymized for

13
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:22,980
um

14
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,619
opsec reasons uh which is

15
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,660
the the person we tracked isn't you know

16
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,939
the uh you'll see the opsec isn't isn't

17
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,560
the prettiest thing in the world but

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,120
uh we're gonna do our best to practice

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,640
our own uh I'm nicoscoli I'm the founder

20
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,260
and CEO of a company called Fortress oh

21
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,399
we have a booth here so if you guys have

22
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,719
any questions about the presentation you

23
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,579
can stop by after this or come see me at

24
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,660
the booth

25
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,160
um I volunteered a group called the

26
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,260
Traverse project with Aiden and Aiden go

27
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,120
ahead and introduce yourself

28
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,460
yes I'm in I'm a full stack developer by

29
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,800
day a cyber crime researcher by night as

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,320
they say uh I have some published

31
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,059
research relating to fishing and cyber

32
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,739
security including this particular

33
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,840
investigation and then I also work with

34
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,120
several ngos like uh the Traverse

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,459
project to combat child exploitation and

36
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,619
human trafficking my socials are there

37
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,659
so if you or took a particular interest

38
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,400
in this and want to have the full

39
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,659
research or you can reach out to me

40
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,060
there and as well as shout out to mantas

41
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,619
he did some of the initial investigation

42
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,260
with me and he had an article on

43
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,720
cybernews.com

44
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,759
cool so just as important as who we are

45
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,759
is who we are not uh we are not cops

46
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,259
sometimes people applaud when we do that

47
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,420
I guess you guys are all cops uh we're

48
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,640
also not lawyers uh I say this all to

49
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,020
say that uh we're going to be making

50
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,700
some accusations that aren't necessarily

51
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,439
based in law or

52
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,479
um things that would hold up in court uh

53
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,460
so don't hold them against us and also

54
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,700
uh you know take everything with with a

55
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,500
grain of salt uh what we're doing is

56
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,479
inspired by you know data back things

57
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,060
not necessarily legal or uh law

58
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,340
enforcement back things so this

59
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,600
investigation is going to be one that

60
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,640
most people here are all too familiar

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,979
with which is uh fishing originating

62
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,799
from Facebook Messenger so I no joke got

63
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,840
a message this morning from this

64
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,180
campaign uh this particular campaign is

65
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,680
is incredibly prolific and the first

66
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,318
time I ever saw it was in September of

67
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,900
2020 and it's been around since like

68
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,900
2018 or 2019 still to this day operated

69
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,060
uh by the same exact group now Aiden

70
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,040
came about it a similar way I think it

71
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,780
was like a family member

72
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,500
um was targeted by it and most likely by

73
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,360
the numbers that we'll get into everyone

74
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
here knows someone or has personally

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,040
received the link from this campaign or

76
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
click the link from this campaign

77
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,080
so this particular campaign uh is the is

78
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,840
that you scam so someone will send uh

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,459
you a link via Facebook Messenger that

80
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:43,319
says is that you in this video this is

81
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,959
like a scam as old as time itself is

82
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,459
that you you got to see yourself in this

83
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,780
video you got to see these pictures of

84
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,420
yourself whatever and when you click the

85
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,680
link you're sent to a fake Facebook

86
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,440
login portal now to a normal user with a

87
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,540
normal amount of tech literacy this is

88
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,940
not an uncommon thing to have to do

89
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,560
within a platform where when you go to a

90
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,640
different page you go to different part

91
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,900
of the application you're asked to

92
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,700
re-authenticate sometimes just on a Time

93
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,660
basis people are asked to

94
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,700
re-authenticate in certain apps so most

95
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,620
people don't bat an eye at the fact that

96
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,420
they have to plug their credentials in

97
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,620
uh one more time to access this video

98
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,519
once you've entered your credentials

99
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,780
obviously it gets sent straight to the

100
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,940
adversary and this particular adversary

101
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,580
has posted a lot of YouTube videos

102
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,659
um which I think they intended to be

103
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,040
private but are public where they

104
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,900
demonstrate how the automation portion

105
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,420
of this works but this is something they

106
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,739
sent out to people they recruit to show

107
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,980
them how to operate it themselves but

108
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,379
basically there's a uh an Android

109
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,540
um sort of like an Android emulator that

110
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,480
has these uh automated macros running on

111
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,239
it that will take the credentials log

112
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,340
into the account like spin up the spin

113
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,040
up the thing log into the account send a

114
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,480
similar message to everyone in Facebook

115
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,980
Messenger all of the person's contacts

116
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,200
and Facebook Messenger automatically

117
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,040
um and then spin down so you can see how

118
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,720
that kind of that's how things like this

119
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
kind of spread uh exponentially like

120
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
once the link hits a single person and

121
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,659
ends up in the inbox of maybe like five

122
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,000
or six hundred people it it goes out

123
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,319
like that so once we see it hit a

124
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,640
particular country and I'll talk about

125
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,560
how we track the the geography of the

126
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,060
attack but

127
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,139
um once we saw it hit a particular

128
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:17,339
country would hang around there for like

129
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,260
a week or so just really spreading

130
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,540
through to hundreds of thousands or

131
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,740
millions of people in a particular

132
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,560
geography now when you click the login

133
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,699
button

134
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,020
um and it's something I can't show here

135
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,160
because we're we're actually live

136
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,199
streaming this so I'm not going to go on

137
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,419
the infrastructure but uh when you click

138
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,340
the login button on the fake portal if

139
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,360
you're looking at like the developer

140
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,520
console in a browser you'll see a bunch

141
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,460
of 200 requests and then a 301 or 300

142
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,199
whatever the redirect um is but you'll

143
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,300
see a bunch of 200 status codes and then

144
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,860
redirects and then 200 status codes

145
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,020
redirects and what that is

146
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,820
um it doesn't take much research of the

147
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,199
the links it's hitting to find out those

148
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,479
are all ad networks particularly usually

149
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,400
like sketchy ones or scammy ones but a

150
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,979
lot of just legitimate ad networks

151
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,139
um that that people use to broker or bid

152
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,500
ads uh for you know normal normal to

153
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,180
large companies

154
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,259
um and that's how the adversary makes

155
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,880
money that's how the the scammer in this

156
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,620
case makes money is when someone clicks

157
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,880
the login button I mean they also bundle

158
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,280
up the credits and sell them but most of

159
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,540
the money that's is made through this

160
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,080
operation is made from the uh the ad

161
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,180
harvesting so it's really it's kind of a

162
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,400
form of Click fraud where you you click

163
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,800
the login button and the browser

164
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,080
registers as you having viewed like 15

165
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,699
or so ads

166
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,320
um and then the person who referred you

167
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,479
to Those ads gets a kickback and that

168
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,740
kickback is split between a bunch of

169
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,820
different people involved in this

170
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,139
operation

171
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,600
but when we looked at the code the HTML

172
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,940
and the JS that's involved in the

173
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,320
website there were a couple things that

174
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,600
stuck out one is the author of the code

175
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,160
signed it so the person who wrote the

176
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,560
original login portal in the back ends

177
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,720
for it sign the code as their own

178
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,240
um two is they used a web analytics

179
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,620
tracker so a website that like

180
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,240
Footprints the connections and takes out

181
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,820
basic stuff user agents uh you know

182
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,639
geolocations the IP and a couple other

183
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,780
uh

184
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,220
and then it'll extract from that like

185
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,840
what are they what OS are they coming

186
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,940
from what browser context are they

187
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,340
coming from and each we found you know

188
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,720
tons of pages

189
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,160
associated with the campaign that have

190
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,300
the same code but the only thing that

191
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,100
changed between them was the web

192
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,080
analytics tracker would have a different

193
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,699
thing appended to the end of it which we

194
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,979
would come to find out is is usernames

195
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,539
the uh the only other thing that was

196
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,560
different and this is something that

197
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,660
would rotate on like a weekly or monthly

198
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,819
monthly basis was a server so it was a

199
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:30,780
server that they would retrieve

200
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,580
additional code from that did pretty

201
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,699
pretty you know benign tasks uh usually

202
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,400
like uh tracking locations

203
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,740
uh referring back to the the adversary's

204
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,060
back end where the person was referred

205
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,960
from

206
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
um but this is something that would stay

207
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,979
the same for a while some XYZ domain and

208
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,199
then rotate eventually but between every

209
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,699
page we would see this little username

210
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,960
at the end change

211
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,000
so what we figured out is if you visit

212
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the web analytics tracker itself and

213
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,620
swap out widget which is what they were

214
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,060
using to make the call to provide the

215
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,639
context to the uh host if you switch out

216
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,740
widgets with stats you're able to

217
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,139
without authenticating uh view again

218
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,639
don't know if that's a bug or feature

219
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,840
but without authenticating you can see

220
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,120
all of the activity on a user's account

221
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,520
so you can see right when you visit the

222
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,840
page you see like a history of the past

223
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,940
couple hours and you can also see active

224
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,620
sessions on the site so if you click

225
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,060
readers that shows you all the active

226
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,919
sessions that's what I have

227
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,479
on the right here so those were people

228
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,620
who were currently on the site people

229
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,000
who referred to the site where they're

230
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,220
coming from whether it's uh what OS

231
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,479
context whether they're within Facebook

232
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,280
Messenger or not

233
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,800
um and whether they're mobile or desktop

234
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,860
Now using the session tracking URLs we

235
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,560
plug them into urlscan.io and using a

236
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,539
couple queries relatively simple ones we

237
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,340
were able to figure out all of the other

238
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,919
sites that referred people to this uh or

239
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,720
that had somewhere in the transactions

240
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,660
the web transactions a referral to uh

241
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,940
the stats tracking site and we found and

242
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,520
spot checked I think like about a

243
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,280
hundred of them by hand uh and started

244
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,099
plugging in the usernames to the

245
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,819
to the back end of the uh of the stats

246
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,020
tracking application that I showed you

247
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,240
before uh and then clicking views shows

248
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,800
us historical page views and all of the

249
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,759
numbers we're going to show you are from

250
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,199
2022

251
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,520
um The Campaign has really not slowed

252
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,199
down at all in 2023 it's gotten a little

253
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,360
bit larger in fact but this is when you

254
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,860
plug in one of those usernames to the

255
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,199
page views thing uh we see 8 million for

256
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:24,120
that page in 2022 and that's for sync

257
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,500
each one of these is hosted by a single

258
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,819
user

259
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,800
um and five million unique sessions so

260
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,360
you can see like these links really

261
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,279
spread around uh and a lot of people end

262
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,919
up hitting them several times

263
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,200
uh because the the tracking ID is the

264
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,700
same but the message might be slightly

265
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,140
different the URL itself might be

266
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,339
slightly different

267
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,080
and then using a tool called lookie-loo

268
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,060
which is man maintained by the cert of

269
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,339
Luxembourg um it's a it's a really cool

270
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:48,480
free

271
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,120
um web forensics tool we used a feature

272
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,100
they have uh that allows you to search

273
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,500
for embedded elements across other

274
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,580
websites that have been scanned in

275
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,880
looking so across urlscan.io and lookilu

276
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,500
our sort of bottleneck is that all the

277
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,240
pages we were looking at are things that

278
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,860
have been submitted either manually or

279
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,839
programmatically to these sites so our

280
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,760
footprint of the campaign is only what

281
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,680
we could find but once we get in the

282
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,779
numbers you'll see that that footprint

283
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,420
alone is is is really substantial

284
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,100
so using the embedded elements feature

285
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,899
we saw at the time of this it was about

286
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,680
400 489 unique domains that had the

287
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,060
embedded element on it spot checked all

288
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,320
of them they are all the exact same

289
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,720
thing all associated with the same code

290
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,760
and infrastructure all the same

291
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,040
pretty much everything uh same back end

292
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,500
servers serving up the JavaScript

293
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,140
um more recently it was closer to 900 so

294
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,000
that's the figure we we operate on it's

295
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,980
probably more now that 900 figures from

296
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,800
uh months ago so uh what we're operating

297
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,959
on is is putting all these estimates

298
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,339
together that we're going to talk about

299
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,300
based on 900 unique domains that we

300
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,860
found and the traffic we were able to

301
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,380
extract associated with this uh

302
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,820
particular campaign

303
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
now Aiden gets to do the fun part

304
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,220
all right so let's talk about bad guy

305
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,320
codes our author

306
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,660
um his domain was seized in 2021 thanks

307
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,880
to Nick's work or might not be Nick at

308
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,320
all I'm not sure

309
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,839
um but uh as you can see

310
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,420
um it's been seized and it interesting

311
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,800
side note we're gonna I want to talk

312
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,120
about this for a few minutes it had his

313
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,820
phone number his name and when it was

314
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,399
seized it started redirecting to an

315
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,160
interesting image on an image BB so

316
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,420
that's quite the funny note he doesn't

317
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,700
seem to be too happy that he uh was

318
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,019
caught

319
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,940
um so let's talk about Bad Guy Code it's

320
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,279
relevant because when I first started

321
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,279
investigating this group I only know

322
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,720
knew about the author I didn't really

323
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,459
know the infrastructure side of things

324
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,959
so I reached out to this author pretty

325
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,880
upset it was a family member who was

326
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
hacked so I wanted to know why it

327
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,500
happened who did it and and how can I

328
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,720
stop them obviously he didn't want me to

329
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,399
stop them but he did tell me about who

330
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,779
they were

331
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,000
um mostly just where they're from and

332
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,860
how much money they make so they make

333
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,140
around 150 dollars for every thousand

334
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,240
visits in the United States now to me

335
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,980
that seems a little high so I'm going to

336
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,300
take that number with a grain of salt

337
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,180
but keep in mind even at five dollars

338
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,800
per thousand visits which doesn't seem

339
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,959
too extreme especially for United States

340
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,240
users who are more lucrative

341
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,040
um that's a significant amount of money

342
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,540
even with the numbers we're about to see

343
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,880
so let's move on

344
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,980
let's talk about the revenue estimate so

345
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,140
like we said we have 900 unique domains

346
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,620
that we found through lucky Lou and URL

347
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,959
scan and all these different tools and

348
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,579
we average the number of visitors on

349
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:33,959
each of these domains and the number

350
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,579
came out to just short of a million

351
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,880
which is 985 000 so that's the number of

352
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,399
sessions per each domain then we took

353
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,100
that number and multiplied it by the

354
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,940
number that our thread actor gave us 150

355
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,980
and we come out with 37 million dollars

356
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,540
after adjusting for the click-through

357
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,399
rate the reason we have to adjust for

358
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,899
the click-through rate is because most

359
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,820
of these links never transferred to

360
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,380
direct redirects so they were still

361
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,300
showing the phishing page one year two

362
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,220
years later so the only way you could

363
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,959
get these ads was by clicking the login

364
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,480
link it means successfully fished so

365
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,880
even then 28 as a corporate

366
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,740
click-through rate now the user base of

367
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,000
corporate click-through rate is Tech

368
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,579
literate people who are maybe a bit

369
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:17,339
younger and this is Facebook so we can

370
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:18,959
infer that the click-through rate is

371
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,839
going to be much higher so again the

372
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,399
number is much higher than even what we

373
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,279
calculated and it's still using the 900

374
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,560
domains Which is less than what it

375
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,399
probably is now so our grand total 37

376
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,620
million dollars that's for ad revenue

377
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,019
and then for uh credential harvesting

378
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,459
because we know these guys are selling

379
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,399
these combos of the dark web uh 248

380
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,620
thousand dollars and keep in mind these

381
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,120
are fresh credentials so these are

382
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,860
actively being used by users on Facebook

383
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,079
so they're much more lucrative

384
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,000
if they're using on Facebook they could

385
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,160
be using it on their bank or other

386
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,320
sensitive sites so they could be

387
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,360
charging more than a dollar per thousand

388
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,459
ballistically and on the low end of this

389
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,220
conservative estimate we're getting uh

390
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,639
12 million dollars hey Nick the estimate

391
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,139
is 0.15 per click

392
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,459
are you still using the 150 though

393
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,880
okay we're gonna stick with those

394
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,339
numbers all right let's talk about the

395
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:21,480
back end let's talk about what these bad

396
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,540
guys are doing so when I first started

397
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,480
this I took an initial index of all the

398
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,740
different domains we had so I could

399
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,540
perform Network reconnaissance and all

400
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,000
these domains and one of those was uh

401
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,060
knox.app or we'll say it is and in

402
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,040
knockstand app we found I found a

403
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,279
residual file called with a with a text

404
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,279
called displays E4 as well as a byline

405
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:47,339
of who made this dashboard it looked to

406
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:49,620
be a splash page image that would appear

407
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,980
behind a login prompt so pretty useful

408
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,620
we did some very basic ocean done it and

409
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,620
found an existing dashboard that was

410
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,600
indexed by Google so we'll be able to

411
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,700
find that as well as a repository

412
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,899
belonging to Mr Cheese or Kingpin here

413
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,680
so Mr Cheese also had that uh his author

414
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,019
uh he was an author of this repository

415
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,740
and on his uh profile for this uh

416
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,440
github-like site we have his name which

417
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,240
is David L

418
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
um in the name of it cheese

419
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,600
there we go and uh so uh using this

420
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,820
we'll be able to find credentials

421
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,100
through tools like dehashed of course we

422
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,420
didn't need it because we found an

423
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,279
unauthenticated Dash where we'll be able

424
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,440
to access most of the information we

425
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,720
need so let's talk about that

426
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,120
this is really exciting here we go we're

427
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,459
into the bad guys infrastructure so we

428
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,260
have combos clusters and users let's

429
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,779
talk about combos first like I said uh

430
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,180
these individuals uh were selling these

431
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,279
uh credentials and we could see that

432
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,959
because on the dashboard you could

433
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,060
export

434
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,740
credentials based off of a country which

435
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,019
is important because you might not want

436
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,820
to sell the United States presidentials

437
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,320
for the same class as the Indian

438
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,540
credentials so very important that that

439
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,800
was a clue that they were selling these

440
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,199
in addition the format of the files that

441
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,540
they were exporting was username or

442
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,959
email colon password which if you've

443
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,180
ever looked at credential leaks where

444
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,160
they're selling them on dark websites or

445
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,920
even clear websites like um I don't know

446
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,420
what's one of the recent ones that's

447
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,899
been rated I breached that's the format

448
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,880
they have so they're definitely selling

449
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,860
these credentials and so that's how we

450
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,779
know that in addition we have clusters

451
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:35,160
we're going to circle back to that let's

452
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,380
talk about users first so each of these

453
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,300
users of the dashboard paid to use the

454
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,220
dashboard they were selling this as a

455
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,660
service think of it like a SAS company

456
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,279
but for criminals

457
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,560
um so you could access the dashboard use

458
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,240
all their tools and their infrastructure

459
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,339
and for that you would have to pay a

460
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,560
nominal fee up front in addition to a

461
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,860
percentage moving forward in addition we

462
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,360
had subgroups so let's talk about that

463
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,820
these are clusters of individuals which

464
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,040
we identified as kind of like think of

465
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,680
it as a low-level gang in a mafia

466
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,899
so we have our kingpins and our our

467
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,639
management and our head guys at the top

468
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,260
of the mafia and they're taking the

469
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,120
biggest cut and then we have our

470
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,100
individual groups with our own leaders

471
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,199
who are taking a cut of the low-level

472
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,300
criminals who would be responsible for

473
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,760
spreading these links using the

474
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,839
tutorials we talked about earlier where

475
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,959
they're um finding them on YouTube

476
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,100
so

477
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,860
each individual user had their own page

478
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,480
and this is where we're able to confirm

479
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,339
the idea that they're redirecting to

480
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,440
multiple links to increase profit and

481
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,959
the compensation

482
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,899
by default these users were getting 30

483
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,480
percent of the money that they made so

484
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,560
the Kingpin is taking 70 percent of 37

485
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,540
million dollars that is a lot of money

486
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,699
for fishing this is a low-level crime we

487
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,139
don't think about it as an organized

488
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,240
crime at least I I didn't before I

489
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,459
learned about this so it puts in

490
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,500
perspective the amount of money these

491
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,139
organizations can make when they get on

492
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,300
a scale like this

493
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,819
um and then for these groups they were

494
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:08,160
also able to specify how much their

495
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,780
individual users make so that's that

496
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,000
structure again

497
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,380
all right let's talk about Mr Cheese

498
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,599
again he's very important here it's also

499
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,040
my favorite person in the whole wide

500
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,780
world because I'm from Wisconsin so I

501
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,939
love cheese

502
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,059
so Mr Cheese again had this repository

503
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,099
which he created so he could see his

504
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,900
name and through the name we found a

505
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,020
LinkedIn now uh this LinkedIn has a

506
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,000
company that he owns and and operates

507
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,760
called details automaticas uh and that's

508
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,080
not how you pronounce it I'm not French

509
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,059
I don't know French and this is in Paris

510
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,280
France so think of this as a front

511
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,799
company because there's no way I mean

512
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,539
I'll give you credit you can probably

513
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,580
make a lot of money off of detailing

514
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,900
cars in France I'm sure there's some

515
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,240
nice cars we're not making 37 million

516
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,220
dollars in taking home a Ferrari right

517
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,220
that's just not realistic so what we

518
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,440
were able to link this company to the

519
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,679
the dashboard is through an account

520
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,840
named after the dashboard well they

521
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,020
uploaded files relating to the company

522
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,059
so very clearly this is a front company

523
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:10,620
and we'll be able to confirm it

524
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,539
obviously again through the name of the

525
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:15,240
file and the name of the account with

526
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,640
this document so

527
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,500
that is a taste a taste of the

528
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
infrastructure and a scale of of this

529
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,620
organization and and how they operate

530
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,760
normally here we would do a

531
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,919
demonstration of some of the other Pages

532
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,200
we found a live demonstration but since

533
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,640
this is recorded in the live streamed

534
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,500
obviously we can't do that because if Mr

535
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,539
Cheese himself is watching we wouldn't

536
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,700
want him to know what we know

537
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,260
so

538
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,700
um again just a taste of this any

539
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,140
researchers in the audience who want to

540
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,580
reach out to us afterwards please do

541
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,980
we'd love to work with you and of course

542
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,020
there is our our socials and the first

543
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,880
two slides if you got a chance to take a

544
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,960
picture of that you can reach out there

545
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,360
as well and after that I will pass it on

546
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,840
to Nick

547
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,940
okay so a question you might be asking

548
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,820
yourself after hearing about a pretty

549
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,480
common and relatively unsophisticated uh

550
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,220
well impressively sophisticated for the

551
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,840
for the nature of the operation but

552
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,360
relatively unsophisticated technically

553
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,100
you might be asking yourself why does

554
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,360
this matter there's a million of these

555
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,559
going on

556
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,299
um the scale that they operate at is

557
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,160
relatively large but

558
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,280
um the victim here is just you know the

559
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,260
end user having their credentials stolen

560
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,700
so

561
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,580
in uh in all of this sort of post you

562
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,660
know after collecting all the numbers

563
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,400
collecting a lot more forensic artifacts

564
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,660
that we end up delivering to a lot of

565
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,220
different parties who may or may not

566
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,500
have been involved

567
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,940
we found a lot of third-party web

568
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,500
application deployment services that the

569
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,539
adversary was using to host the websites

570
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:43,620
so these are really common right

571
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,299
glitch.me

572
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,059
um ecoz.net Sam cart which is you know

573
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:50,940
largely hosting legitimate businesses

574
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,700
uh all of these service providers are

575
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,200
are places you can you can typically

576
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,059
quick deploy a project

577
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:58,620
um using their infrastructure or yours

578
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,780
but host it on uh using them as a parent

579
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,400
domain so your project is a sub domain

580
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,200
now it's not super easy for these social

581
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,380
networks to outright block uh the use of

582
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,640
all of these third-party web application

583
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,320
deployment Services because they could

584
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,360
be blocking a lot of legitimate activity

585
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,299
now we reached out to a lot of these um

586
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,940
and the the adversary themselves has uh

587
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,500
they have a page where they that they

588
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,960
send to the recruities to generate these

589
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,419
URLs and they have options for for most

590
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:25,320
major

591
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,460
um social network companies so they're

592
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,960
not strictly focused on Facebook the

593
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,220
numbers we covered are specific to

594
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,900
Facebook but they're focused on all

595
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,520
kinds of uh all kinds of different

596
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,039
social networks that people operate on

597
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,280
um and this is a relatively anecdotal

598
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,440
um finding but in looking through all of

599
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,299
the uh web forensics tools that

600
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,520
inventory the subdomains of these uh

601
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,559
places and checking them out in in very

602
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,460
large amounts it seems like potentially

603
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,580
an overwhelming at least a lot or

604
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,260
potential you know anecdotally an

605
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,900
overwhelming majority of of projects

606
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,120
spun up on these services are scams our

607
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,520
phishing pages are totally illegitimate

608
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,220
and do not represent uh real companies

609
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,960
on the back end

610
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,940
uh so

611
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,679
we reached out to all the parties

612
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,120
involved told them about the scale told

613
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,679
them about the numbers um gave them all

614
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,600
the artifacts they needed to you know do

615
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,039
whatever it is they want to do with the

616
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,539
information

617
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,700
um and surprisingly or unsurprisingly uh

618
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,799
we got no response well we got responses

619
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,559
but the responses were um

620
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:27,900
sort of like a we don't want to know

621
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,179
um kind of situation you might be asking

622
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:33,120
yourself why or maybe not but put on

623
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,000
your tinfoil ask for this one uh but the

624
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,299
adversarial activity operating on the

625
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,000
social networking sites as well as on

626
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,500
the third party web application

627
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,360
deployment Services sites this is this

628
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,320
conversation is informed by

629
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,400
conversations with a lot of people who

630
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,500
work in uh Internet advertising and

631
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,720
online ad bidding a lot of this

632
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,419
malicious activity generates based on

633
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:55,620
the numbers we showed you just about a

634
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,240
billion clicks from what we found over

635
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,539
the last year generates a lot of traffic

636
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,520
now for the web application deployment

637
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,799
Services these traffic this traffic is

638
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,900
their metrics for Success it's the new

639
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,299
users it's the new website spun up it's

640
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,159
new accounts it's retention rate it's

641
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,020
referrals from other websites the

642
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,299
numbers uh generated by this malicious

643
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:18,179
activity are the success success metrics

644
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:19,500
they use to raise money that they show

645
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,419
their board things that they things that

646
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:22,919
they deliver to say look how much

647
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,539
activity is going on on our website look

648
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:25,799
how many people are using our web

649
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,559
service it's it's really ideal for them

650
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,760
not to know

651
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,159
and on the advertising side after

652
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,900
conversations with with ad bidding

653
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,460
people

654
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,799
a lot of the uh a lot of the social

655
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:38,940
networks

656
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,640
um price their ads by uh previous day's

657
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,559
activity and by volume so how many

658
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,179
people are visiting our website how many

659
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:46,980
people are clicking links and leaving

660

661
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,059
know start on Snapchat and then end up

662
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,039
on an article or in a web store or in

663
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,780
something else this is part of the

664
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,000
algorithm apparently a reasonably large

665
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,159
part of the algorithm that informs how

666
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,140
much they're going to charge for an ad

667
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,960
and the you know ads on these platforms

668
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,220
is their bread and butter it's it's

669
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,080
really how they make money and a lot of

670
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,120
them are struggling right now at least

671
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,419
like in the stock market so suffice it

672
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,460
to say eliminating all of this traffic

673
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,320
which anecdotally having looked at a lot

674
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
of the sites spun up on these uh these

675
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,880
quick web app deployment Services look

676
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,159
overwhelmingly malicious I mean we're

677
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:24,659
talking about billions of clicks just

678
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,380
for uh you know a handful of campaigns

679
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,120
allowing this activity to continue or at

680
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,980
least looking the other way on it uh is

681
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,299
good for the books it's good for the

682
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,679
bottom line it's really helpful for

683
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,360
raising money

684
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,580
um and it makes money there is actually

685
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,039
a financial motive to allow the activity

686
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,559
to continue because the victim here is

687
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,780
well a like a a small part of the bottom

688
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,159
line of many companies who are paying

689
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,480
these sketchy ad bidding services to

690
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,460
present their ads uh but also the users

691
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,380
and these are end users which to the

692
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,880
tune of you know we we see them selling

693
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,919
the credentials we uh in the dashboard

694
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,500
had access to the export function for uh

695
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,940
the combos which they organized

696
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,380
regionally and we're talking tens of

697
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,059
thousands usually in a couple days clear

698
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,440
them out tens of thousands clear them

699
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,720
out that's how they operated

700
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,340
so we're talking about a lot of people

701
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,200
but it's just people and they're not

702
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,340
complaining

703
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,539
um they're certainly not organized in

704
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,100
their complaints uh and they're not

705
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,900
really blaming the platforms for the

706
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,659
scam so really everyone's happy with the

707
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,400
way things are right now despite the

708
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,140
very impressive numbers

709
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,780
um the impact to the user doesn't seem

710
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,820
to be enough to move the needle

711
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,159
um despite the relatively non-technical

712
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,100
solutions that would be required to

713
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,960
patch up this problem

714
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,760
um sort of once and for all

715
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,140
so with that said you can take the

716
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,940
tinfoil hats off I'll finish the

717
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,740
presentation with the second annual

718
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,900
scammy mix scams a lot Awards uh we did

719
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,860
this one last year for a different

720
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,559
scammer uh but for this year

721
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,159
um

722
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,440
again relatively unsurprising but our

723
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,480
winner is David El gruyere from Paris

724
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,640
France net worth maybe 30 million

725
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,960
dollars

726
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,400
um and his hobbies include stealing your

727
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,600
grandparents Facebook credential and the

728
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,679
superlative he's been presented with

729
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,840
this year was most atrocious opsec we

730
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,360
really we just touched

731
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,039
um the amount of stuff that uh was out

732
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,840
there about um this individual and their

733
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,980
groups and the employees of the front

734
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,980
companies but the opsec was was truly

735
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,419
impressively bad so round of applause

736
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,360
for David good work see you again next

737
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,440
year

738
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,059
so that's it thank you guys for sticking

739
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,919
around uh we'll now open the floor for

740
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,220
questions

741
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,039
Jim

742
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:31,740
don't forget to repeat the question

743
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,419
that's an idea um so his question was

744
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:34,860
why don't you report directly to the

745
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,760
board

746
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,140
um I can't imagine the board would would

747
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,000
have a different you know resolution

748
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,220
it's good for business or at least it's

749
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,779
it's good to look the other way to

750
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,580
maintain the business because removing

751
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,320
the activity is going to hurt ad Revenue

752
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,720
uh and it's going to hurt you know user

753
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,340
metrics for the uh for the web

754
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,140
application deployment services

755
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,039
so who knows

756
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,260
yeah he said the audit board would want

757
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,100
to know probably true yes

758
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,320
uh that was the annual figure so that's

759
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,779
about like again if we're talking about

760
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,520
150

761
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,600
um was what he said for a thousand

762
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,279
visitors from the US that's like 15

763
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,980
cents a click which is insane

764
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,480
um and probably not accurate we we put

765
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,919
it down to a more realistic five cents

766
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,600
informed by conversations with adrev

767
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,919
people

768
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:23,700
um

769
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,779
uh

770
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,779
uh or five per session so that put the

771
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,700
annual revenue probably closer to like

772
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,620
15 million again the low end was 12. if

773
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,760
they're telling the truth if that's how

774
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,720
much they get because most of their

775
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,179
visitors were from Europe and the US uh

776
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,860
we could see the regions right

777
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,320
um most of them uh if they're actually

778
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,520
worth that much then you know it's

779
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,440
closer to 20 or 30 million at the high

780
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,539
end you know 37. but again just of what

781
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,340
we found that's just in what what we

782
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,720
found in our poking and prodding

783
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,360
any other questions

784
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,520
all right I think we're good thanks

785
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,620
everyone

786
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,279
foreign
