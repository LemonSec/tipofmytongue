1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,760
all right everyone let's make some noise

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,460
and then be quiet for our speaker leaf

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,980
I'm Leaf I'm currently taking some time

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,160
off in between jobs but most recently I

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,240
was uh

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,220
senior engineering manager at twilio

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,220
segment for the security features team

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,960
um currently the co-host of the hit

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,560
podcast uh 404 security not found which

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,480
has been described as friends at a

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,099
conference talking about security stuff

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,560
I'm not sure if that was a dig or a

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,140
compliment I took it as a compliment but

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,399
if that sounds like something you want

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,500
to use to catch up on some news we we do

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,940
one a month

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,059
and I'm also a startup advisor and

18
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,640
investor so if you you know have a early

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,079
stage startup I'd love to hear about

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,800
what you're working on

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,280
you might be asking what's next I'm

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,100
joining sem grep in about a month so if

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,520
you uh use sem grep and want to give me

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,320
some some feedback on the product happy

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,260
to take that if you don't use it go buy

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,600
some sem grep make my my options worth

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,280
something so

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,360
um

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,799
uh

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,659
the agenda for today I'm going to give a

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,040
little bit of context about what our

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,600
team's up to I think that's helpful just

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,340
so that you know the types of things

34
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,680
we're creating metrics about

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
I'm gonna try to sell you on why you

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,119
should be doing metrics at your company

37
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,220
although based on your attendance I'm

38
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,080
gonna hope that you're at least kind of

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,360
bought into that already

40
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,180
um gonna kind of walk through a project

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,299
that we did to really upgrade uh our our

42
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,000
own use of metrics and then wrap things

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,920
up and maybe have time for questions

44
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,299
although when I was running through the

45
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:44,280
presentation it was right about time so

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,320
you might have to harass me in person

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,299
afterwards

48
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,520
um so most of what our team builds is

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,280
stuff in the authentication realm so uh

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,579
the whole like login logout flow is all

51
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,220
stuff that we work on we also work on an

52
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,659
internal application called access

53
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,060
service which is something that you can

54
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,100
use to get time based peer-reviewed

55
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,979
access to things there's some commercial

56
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:09,598
tools out there that do this now if

57
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,200
you're familiar with OCTA IGA Crosswire

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,599
opal and I think it's worth keeping in

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,099
mind that segment is a business that

60
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,840
sells to other businesses which I think

61
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,180
makes security a lot easier if your

62
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,280
customers get mad when you do a bad job

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,500
at something the business tends to try

64
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,959
to do a good job at that thing and so I

65
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,239
think that investing in this stuff is is

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,860
a little bit easier when you work at a

67
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,379
B2B company

68
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,440
so uh yeah based on your attendance I'm

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,580
going to assume that you're at least

70
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,560
kind of bought into metrics but I think

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,120
that these are really important because

72
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,280
a lot of security teams really struggle

73
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,379
to quantify and demonstrate the value

74
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,300
that they bring to their org and I think

75
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,340
a lot of that boils down to

76
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,440
other parts of the business not knowing

77
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,300
enough about your team which you can fix

78
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,940
through internal sales to an extent and

79
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,260
then also security just not

80
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,480
understanding enough about the folks

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,560
that they're supposed to be working with

82
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,900
I think that everybody here has probably

83
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,700
heard about a security team that's not

84
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,620
giving practical recommendations or

85
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,480
stuff that Engineers just like know

86
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,159
won't work and you really want to

87
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,480
minimize that because anytime you do

88
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,060
that people are less likely to work with

89
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,280
work with you in the future

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,099
um so the right metrics Empower teams to

91
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,080
communicate cross-functionally it helps

92
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,300
educate other departments about how

93
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,560
things are going what things are

94
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,940
important what things aren't important

95
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,640
and even if you're not a customer facing

96
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,340
team the way that we are or like a

97
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,379
directly customer facing team I'd

98
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,360
encourage you to get creative about how

99
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,280
you can tie things to customer value I

100
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,099
think one thing that I thought was very

101
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,780
clever that our GRC team did is they

102
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,879
started making our sales team enter in

103
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,620
the contract value before they'd give

104
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,140
them a sock 2 report and this wasn't

105
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,280
meant to be like a hurdler or any

106
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,659
anything like there wasn't I don't know

107
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,099
that there's really a minimum bar but

108
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,299
it's just at the end of the quarter you

109
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,700
can say hey we helped out with x million

110
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,319
dollars worth of deals

111
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,360
um because they wanted this this sock 2

112
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,080
report that we had

113
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,560
um so I'm going to talk a little bit

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,659
about access service again this is an

115
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,580
internal app that that we built a couple

116
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,980
years ago and I think the metrics can

117
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,379
also help you justify spending time on

118
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,139
internal stuff or help you rationalize

119
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,660
to other teams why it isn't a good use

120
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,639
of time right now

121
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,298
um

122
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,100
without metrics you might make a

123
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,360
statement like this at the end of the

124
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,440
quarter or the end of the month or

125
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,759
whatever however long you spend on this

126
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:29,460
like hey this thing felt slow We sped it

127
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,220
up and now it's fast

128
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,320
um but if you have metrics on how slow

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,600
something actually is you can make this

130
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,120
a lot more impactful by you know doing a

131
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,620
little bit of research

132
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,800
saying okay hey uh the web standards

133
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,900
recommend a page load in one second

134
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,900
before people start feeling slowed down

135
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,340
it's an internal app so maybe like two

136
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,020
to three seconds is okay but like five

137
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,240
is is definitely too long

138
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,759
um and then you can do a calculation you

139
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,740
know I use calculation very Loosely but

140
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,600
really what I'm what you're doing is

141
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,100
trying to figure out like the effort to

142
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,320
value and so if you think hey it's going

143
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,120
to take us two weeks to speed this thing

144
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,440
up

145
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
um and we can get a 50 reduction in in

146
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,460
loading times like maybe that's good

147
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,040
maybe maybe it's not but you at least

148
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,720
have something that you can go back to

149
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,280
other teams internally and say hey this

150
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,380
is how long it's going to take us to do

151
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,660
this thing this is a good use or a bad

152
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,560
use of our time right now

153
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,080
um so creating a a solid metrics program

154
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,180
is pretty time consuming this was a

155
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,240
pretty solid investment in our team our

156
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,699
by our team this this past year it was

157
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,860
something that two Engineers spent

158
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,320
um like close to a quarter working on uh

159
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,820
obviously Engineers work on plenty of

160
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,680
other things it's not just three months

161
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,780
of straight work on something but

162
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,000
um this is a pretty big investment and

163
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,919
like any meaningful size project you

164
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,960
should be asking is this the right thing

165
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,759
to do right now

166
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,259
um your company or your team probably

167
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,500
has no shortage of of good ideas and

168
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,419
it's really about figuring out if it

169
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,460
makes sense but this was something we we

170
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,139
said we wanted to do at the beginning of

171
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,699
the year so we had already kind of like

172
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,199
put a

173
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,820
um you know some time allocated for it

174
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,979
but we ran into a few issues that I

175
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,720
think we probably could have avoided if

176
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,639
we had had done this work a little bit

177
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,880
earlier we had an internal app that

178
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,639
crashed during a big migration and there

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,319
wasn't really any warning we just looked

180
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,060
at the logs afterwards and we're like oh

181
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,520
hit 100 utilize 100 utilization and

182
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,160
crashed maybe a warning at like 80 that

183
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,660
something bad was going to happen would

184
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,600
have been would have been helpful

185
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,180
um so I break things down into two

186
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,979
different groups of metrics Health

187
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,860
metrics and product metrics

188
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,740
um Health metrics are things that help

189
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,360
you answer is what we maintain

190
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,400
dependable and will we know when

191
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,139
something goes wrong

192
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,639
um I think security engineering teams

193
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,680
should really try to be as similar to

194
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,900
their end counterparts as possible and

195
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,600
so you should just don't reinvent this

196
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,400
wheel like just go to your Edge team and

197
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,539
figure out what they're doing they're

198
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,400
probably better at running reliable

199
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,080
Services than you anyway just steal

200
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,699
their homework

201
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:06,360
um

202
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,880
and so some things that I think like

203
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,919
broadly fit into this category and like

204
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,020
there's probably others too is error

205
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,380
handling uh this is pretty pretty

206
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,400
self-explanatory I think but just to

207
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,960
give you some context on like what we

208
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,000
actually fixed we had some things that

209
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,979
would send errors to Sentry but then

210
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,020
those were inconsistently sent to slack

211
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,880
we had some services that would just

212
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,380
send stuff to slack without going

213
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,360
through Sentry and then you lose out on

214
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,180
all the benefits of Sentry we also had

215
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,259
stuff going to a bunch of different

216
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,880
channels which is annoying because then

217
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,440
people have like more things to look at

218
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,020
it's nice just say hey it you know if

219
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,520
it's important it just goes to this one

220
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,020
channel

221
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,039
um

222
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,599
Sentry also has scheduled task

223
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,340
monitoring so we have a lot of jobs that

224
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,220
just run like once or twice a day and

225
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,599
you're just going to assume that those

226
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,819
are going to keep working until they

227
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:55,560
don't and so Sentry's great because they

228
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,940
have the ability to tell you like hey

229
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,400
this thing didn't run because a lot of

230
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,919
times if this stuff doesn't run and it

231
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,419
doesn't even start to run you won't get

232
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:04,979
any errors so you won't know that it

233
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,800
didn't run we used to use datadog for

234
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,720
this but we actually found Sentry to be

235
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,060
more reliable for monitoring when our

236
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,400
stuff was unreliable

237
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,440
um SLI is this this is like a really

238
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,300
broad category but you can think of like

239
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,039
latency to an external service is

240
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,099
something that might fall into slis

241
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,259
um application performance monitoring

242
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:26,759
this is something that allowed us to

243
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,220
figure out like what

244
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,000
um

245
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,940
what was actually happening in uh in

246
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,159
Access service like why it was so slow

247
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,520
I also these slides are on sketch so

248
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,200
feel free to keep taking pictures but

249
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,539
they're also up there if you want to

250
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,180
just use the stuff that's up there

251
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,620
um

252
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,060
service best practices these aren't

253
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,800
really metrics at all this is just kind

254
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,600
of like in the same broad theme this is

255
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,640
having readme's that are easy to get

256
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,860
someone up and running it's links to

257
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,440
dashboards it's claiming the service in

258
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,060
backstage which is what we use to track

259
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,220
like who owns what I think of this as

260
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,080
just the things that you do to be a good

261
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,560
citizen in your uh in your organization

262
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,420
so some examples of what we might track

263
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,820
for something like off-board Service uh

264
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,260
off-board service is a pretty simple

265
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,080
service it runs once a day it boots

266
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,580
everyone out of the segment application

267
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,680
once they've been deactivated in Octa

268
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,300
and it prevents ex-employees from

269
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,180
accessing their accounts so

270
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,920
for the health metrics

271
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,860
does Sentry think this thing ran were

272
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,779
there any errors if so what were they

273
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,899
how long did it take to run how many

274
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,560
calls did it make to the OCTA API and is

275
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,180
this service something that you know if

276
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,680
somebody needed to make some changes

277
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,420
they're not going to get bogged down and

278
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,519
like fixing a bunch of unrelated

279
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,959
nonsense and just like have a really

280
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,279
hard time getting the service up and

281
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,080
running

282
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,820
switching over to product metrics I

283
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,920
think this is the fun part you get to

284
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,540
put on your product manager hat and

285
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,339
think about why the stuff that you're

286
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,980
building is valuable I think there's

287
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,019
also a lot more art on the the product

288
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,080
metric side than the health metric side

289
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,240
those are much more science is your

290
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,040
thing working or not

291
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,540
um but I think everything that your team

292
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,339
builds should have at least one product

293
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,740
metric if you can't come up with one

294
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,880
reason why the thing that you're

295
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,100
building is important it's probably not

296
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,839
a good thing to build and if you've

297
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,120
already built it you should maybe retire

298
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,500
it

299
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,600
um I learned a lot about this from a

300
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,459
former product manager Rachel who I gave

301
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,040
a presentation with last year

302
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,720
um this I would say this presentation is

303
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,339
like complementary it's it's not a

304
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:34,320
rehash of last time but if you want to

305
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,660
check this one out uh this one's on

306
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,660
YouTube on the uh the b-sides page

307
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,300
yeah it's actually the same brand and I

308
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,040
have matching shorts for both of these

309
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,160
but I didn't know if people wanted that

310
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,140
so I I wore pants

311
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,040
all right I'm I'm keeping that uh next

312
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,360
time I'll wear the matching tops and

313
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,560
bottoms

314
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,920
um so product product metrics

315
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,420
um without any metrics you could

316
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,980
probably say something like this at the

317
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,600
end of the you know however long it

318
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,220
takes you to build this we built

319
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,920
off-board service it remove X employees

320
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,120
simple

321
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,680
um but if you throw even like a little

322
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,680
bit of data in it it sounds a lot better

323
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,019
um and so you can say hey not only does

324
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,140
this help retain customer trust it helps

325
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,339
maintain our compliance with our

326
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,200
internal policies it helps with our sock

327
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,899
too and in the first 30 days it

328
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,720
off-boarded 60x employees 48 of which

329
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,760
were missed by previous manual reviews

330
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,279
so you can draw some comparisons to the

331
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,839
before State once you have this kind of

332
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,019
information

333
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,120
um for product metrics there's plenty of

334
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,320
other things that could be a product

335
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,120
metric these are just some things that I

336
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,820
think are worth at least considering

337
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,440
um if you can tie something to customer

338
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,800
Revenue uh that's always a good one

339
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,600
um if that's a little bit more difficult

340
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,640
just having some data on like how many

341
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,620
customers are using this either just raw

342
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,560
numbers or percentage for internal tools

343
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,079
it's good to try to capture

344
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,760
um how many people are actually using

345
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,680
something in a given week or how many

346
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,839
times a tool completes something that

347
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,300
could be a bad thing avoided or a good

348
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,700
thing encouraged you can also always try

349
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,920
to tie things to team goals or or goals

350
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,899
or company goals those are good because

351
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,700
I would say generally those are things

352
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,100
that other people should at least be

353
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,079
kind of familiar with and so if you can

354
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,820
say hey we did this thing that supports

355
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,260
this other thing that the company said

356
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,420
is important

357
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,339
that is kind of your job so that's a

358
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,959
good thing to to try to do for your

359
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,680
metrics as well

360
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,540
um some product metrics from SSO let's

361
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,160
just say you work at a company that has

362
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,339
100 Mil in ARR you might be able to

363
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,040
track that 30 of your customers have SSO

364
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,180
enabled

365
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,680
um and you might find it somewhat

366
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,920
surprising that so much more revenue is

367
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,720
tied to something rather than the

368
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,940
percentage of users but for something

369
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,800
like SSO that actually makes a lot of

370
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,420
sense because your bigger customers are

371
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,399
the ones that are more likely to pay the

372
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,000
SSO tax and so they are naturally going

373
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,519
to shift this and then it gets even more

374
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,079
uh

375
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,360
the comparison grows when you talk about

376
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,579
something like scam because typically

377
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,060
you have to have SSO enabled anyway

378
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,779
um

379
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,579
if you haven't heard of scim and you

380
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,860
work at a B2B Company please convince

381
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,779
somebody to build it it makes corpse and

382
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,959
it's jobs a lot easier it basically

383
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,339
allows you to do provisioning and

384
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,139
deprovisioning and group mapping and a

385
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,519
bunch of stuff

386
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,339
so uh getting started uh hopefully you

387
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,019
have a list of what your team owns if

388
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,639
not that's okay but that's definitely

389
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,220
Step Zero is figure out what you want to

390
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,040
start tracking things about and then

391
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,540
figure out what the current state of

392
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,860
these are like maybe you have some

393
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,600
metrics maybe you don't that's fine too

394
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,639
and then you should have some idea of

395
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,860
where you're trying to go you're

396
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,120
obviously going to figure stuff out

397
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,940
along the way which is great but just

398
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,279
have have some path that you can plot

399
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,899
from A to B

400
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,940
this is an oversimplified version of

401
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,220
something that we made pretty early it's

402
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,560
just a list of what we own and then like

403
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,779
what the state things are in

404
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,839
um more tiles and datadog or you know

405
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,160
whatever you're using isn't always

406
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,139
better I would say that it can be

407
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,519
overwhelming when you have a bunch of

408
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,120
useless data and so more or less is more

409
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,380
here I think that you want to have the

410
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,940
right stuff tracked rather than just

411
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,920
like a bunch of stuff

412
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,959
so for our implementation

413
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,180
we have all of our services send stuff

414
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,980
to Center your datadog and then we send

415
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,240
stuff to Slack

416
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,240
we also have an internal logging system

417
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,399
that you know is used just kind of like

418
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,139
for debugging stuff so that's kind of

419
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:42,120
unrelated to this but also part of the

420
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,940
same project on the metric side we're

421
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,620
very fortunate to work at a company that

422
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,740
has very smart uh data engineers and

423
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,480
analytics folks that have set up a bunch

424
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,120
of this foundation for us and so we

425
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,440
didn't have to figure out how to tie

426
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,820
something to a customer account in

427
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,040
Salesforce and get the ARR like there

428
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,480
was already patterns in place where we

429
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,120
could say hey this workspace

430
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,120
is related to this amount of money

431
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,100
um but I think that getting good with

432
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,720
business intelligence software is pretty

433
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,060
valuable for for engineers whether

434
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,680
that's a security engineer or software

435
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,300
engineer or whatever because it allows

436
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,440
you to answer a lot of interesting

437
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,060
questions about your business

438
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,660
you can also use bi tools to augment

439
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,060
internal product functionality so we do

440
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,519
this for for Access service which

441
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,139
um as I mentioned earlier it's something

442
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,240
where you can say hey I need access to

443
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,500
this thing for a certain amount of time

444
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,480
like a day or a week somebody else

445
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,760
approves you and then you get access and

446
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,220
then it expires

447
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,620
but we often get asked questions that we

448
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,240
don't want to build something in the

449
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,459
product to answer this question we can

450
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:46,440
just refer to somebody to a dashboard so

451
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,660
somebody might ask like what are all the

452
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,279
tiles that this person is an approver

453
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,199
for they're going on Parental leave and

454
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,519
we want to make sure that we have

455
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,399
coverage for them and you know if we're

456
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,680
a commercial product we would have to

457
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,660
write some database queries add some new

458
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,639
routes put some stuff in the UI write

459
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,579
tests but you can just skip all that and

460
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,260
just write some queries and create a

461
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,240
dashboard in Snowflake and you know it's

462
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,459
fine if you make an internal person go

463
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,100
somewhere else

464
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,839
um so some product metrics that you

465
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,459
might or that we thought about for

466
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,899
Access service just to give some more

467
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,820
examples of what an internal app like

468
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,699
this might care about

469
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:25,560
tiles with less than three approvers so

470
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,720
if this is an OCTA app or a group that

471
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,339
only has one approver and that person

472
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,740
leaves that can be annoying to people

473
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,440
that need access to that thing

474
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,480
um more generally if you have an

475
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,000
internal tool trying to figure out how

476
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,860
many people are using this um if

477
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,180
someone's like hey why are we spending

478
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,440
so much time on this and you can say hey

479
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,060
a third of our company uses this every

480
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,899
week that's a lot easier to justify

481
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:50,940
spending time on that

482
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,620
um something like median approval time

483
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,139
allows us to do a contrast between the

484
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,360
before and after it used to take hours

485
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,980
or maybe a day to get access to

486
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,560
something with access service it's maybe

487
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,779
like three or four minutes in most cases

488
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,419
and then the most active users are a

489
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,699
great pool of people to get feedback

490
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,380
from so if you want to build something

491
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,179
new or you want to change something like

492
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:13,980
hit those people up because they're the

493
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,419
people that probably care the most about

494
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:18,559
what your app does

495
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,339
um so let's assume you you love these

496
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,660
ideas you want to do this at your own

497
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,599
company you should take stock of like

498
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,000
where your metrics are at before maybe

499
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,500
these are all zeros which is totally

500
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,900
fine that's gonna make you look really

501
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,179
good at the end of the project

502
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,760
um but you should have some metrics

503
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,799
about your metrics so you can say Hey

504
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,480
you know just like any other project

505
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,760
this was a lot of work we spent a lot of

506
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,840
time on it

507
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,100
um you know this is kind of the the

508
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,320
before and after and this does get like

509
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,179
a little bit meta of like hey we you

510
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,740
know we put metrics on your metrics but

511
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,600
this is just a you can just think of

512
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,120
this as a project

513
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,440
and your projects probably want to have

514
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,660
metrics this one just happens to also be

515
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,880
about metrics

516
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,480
um

517
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,440
pause for photos

518
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,400
um

519
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,679
so once you once you do this you should

520
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,020
share your work there's probably a lot

521
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,940
of other teams that want something like

522
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,880
this at your company and some of the

523
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,320
things that we did to make this easier

524
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,620
every single snow site dashboard Sal can

525
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,179
attest to this he built a lot of them

526
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,600
has comments and so anybody else from

527
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,820
security or wherever they can go in and

528
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,260
they can see oh this is why they did

529
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,820
that crazy join that I don't understand

530
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,740
let me just copy that because I want the

531
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,419
same thing

532
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,160
um you should have links to all this

533
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,960
stuff in your readme's make it easy for

534
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,880
people to find this stuff and then

535
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,740
present it internally nobody's going to

536
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,059
know that you did this stuff if you

537
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,520
don't tell them that you did it and this

538
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,380
is a good way to you know to practice a

539
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,640
lot of things but it's also a good way

540
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,679
just to make people aware of what's

541
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,080
available to them and say like hey go go

542
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,780
steal our queries they're also a great

543
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,520
thing to put in promo packets I think

544
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,020
that a lot of managers get caught off

545
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,000
guard when people start asking them

546
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,559
questions about impact and stuff like

547
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,059
that and it's a lot easier if you can

548
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,500
just say like hey we made this thing 25

549
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,520
better 25 faster whatever if you have

550
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,380
the data at least that's been my

551
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,820
experience during promo and like

552
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,160
calibration time is I feel like the the

553
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,720
managers that have metrics usually do

554
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,900
better

555
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,039
um this is also something that you

556
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:20,940
should start thinking about during

557
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,679
project planning so we actually have a

558
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,020
section in our template that's like what

559
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,760
are you going to track about this thing

560
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,919
and you don't even necessarily have to

561
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,600
have a goal like you don't have to say

562
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,919
like Hey we're going to make this thing

563
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,020
10 better whatever I think it's good if

564
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,240
you do but just having the raw data so

565
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,679
that at some point in the future when

566
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,600
you want to make improvements you don't

567
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,460
have to spend a month collecting data

568
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,440
you just have the data about like the

569
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,539
usage and things like that

570
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,520
you need to include time for this in

571
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,960
your project plan if you don't

572
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,820
somebody's just going to say hey the

573
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,919
thing's built move on to the next thing

574
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,500
unfortunately this stuff has to happen

575
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,900
at the end because otherwise there's no

576
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,320
data to build the dashboards and so

577
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,720
it can be put into an awkward spot but I

578
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,980
think if you put this as part of your

579
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,539
project plan it makes it easier to

580
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,100
defend the time that it takes to do this

581
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,480
um one last example this was something

582
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,820
that um we had an intern two summers ago

583
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,280
uh she did a fantastic job on this this

584
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,559
project the goal was to get more people

585
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,539
using MFA

586
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,100
um more more customers specifically

587
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,620
using MFA and the way that we targeted

588
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,120
them is we went after the workspace

589
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,220
owners and got the workspace owners to

590
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,960
force MFA for their workspace because

591
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,840
then that just gets everybody

592
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,059
um and without any metrics this still

593
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,200
would have been pretty good especially

594
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,940
for an intern like hey successfully

595
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,679
completed this project got a lot of

596
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,780
people to enroll but because we had

597
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,000
metrics of how many people were using

598
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,460
MFA before

599
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,020
we could do something like this where

600
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,400
it's like hey we actually saw a 25

601
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,740
increase these are the total number of

602
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,440
impacted users for all those workspaces

603
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,240
we had originally guessed we'd maybe see

604
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,520
like a 10 increase so I don't know if

605
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,960
we're just bad at guessing or just

606
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,760
sandbagging but

607
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,080
um yeah this looked really good during

608
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,500
her final uh presentation

609
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,200
some closing thoughts uh metrics make

610
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,700
your team stand out during quarterly

611
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,200
progress reports and help you

612
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,020
supercharge performance reviews and they

613
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,419
also make it easy to communicate

614
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,340
cross-functionally

615
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,220
um and it allows your organization to

616
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,720
see how things are getting hopefully

617
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,000
better maybe worse over time but just

618
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,580
having the data makes that a lot easier

619
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,559
so if you want to try this for yourself

620
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,780
I highly recommend using whatever your

621
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,640
company already has set up and paying

622
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,559
and is paying for

623
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:39,780
um this stuff does mention like segment

624
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,299
and Snowflake and whatever but all those

625
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,039
are things that could be swapped out for

626
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,600
like Tableau or like whatever else

627
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,400
you're using

628
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,380
um this will be recorded as part of

629
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,440
b-sides uh the I wrote a Blog about this

630
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,940
in December so if you want to go back

631
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,100
and not listen to me again and just read

632
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,039
through it uh pretty much everything in

633
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,159
the in here is in there and if you don't

634
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,780
have this stuff set up and you want to

635
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,799
play around with stuff on your own

636
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,559
twilio and or segment and snowflake both

637
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,120
have free tutorials you can you can mess

638
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,919
around with stuff but yeah definitely

639
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,960
use what your company is paying for

640
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,840
and then lastly we got some other talks

641
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,320
to walk watch my girlfriend's on a panel

642
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,780
um with some other great people uh that

643
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,340
are some of them are in the front row I

644
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,000
don't see Louis but uh wow

645
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,919
uh

646
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:30,720
there's some okay people on the panel

647
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,100
and then uh tomorrow uh we have some

648
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,580
some current and and past twilio folks

649
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,980
so we've got Kelly Robinson we've got

650
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,900
Sal who I mentioned earlier he's talking

651
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,780
about some uh cool API security stuff

652
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,240
we're doing and then Colleen

653
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,659
right there our former CSO is on a panel

654
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,940
as well so check these out the slides

655
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,679
are are already up as I mentioned and

656
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,380
then the blogs there uh

657
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,200
questions or do I get kicked off

658
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,919
one minute

659
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,360
all right let's do it

660
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,980
yeah

661
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,620
the audience is counting on you yeah we

662
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,120
have one question we have one minute to

663
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,039
stop so if you guys something has a hot

664
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,919
take for leaf raise your hands and sing

665
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,400
it out loud

666
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,080
are you talking about that tomorrow or

667
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,120
later today or no

668
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:32,640
so my team doesn't really do incident

669
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,100
response stuff unless it's helping out

670
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,440
with something that that we own I

671
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,720
imagine that there's probably a

672
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,299
a place for metrics on any security team

673
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,580
but I'm not a good person to ask about

674
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,340
that yeah go to the panel they claim

675
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,240
they'll talk about it

676
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,120
hey

677
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,580
uh

678
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,440
100

679
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,980
right way too much

680
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,580
so Snow's site is the bi tool that

681
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,919
either snowflake comes with or or we pay

682
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,480
extra for

683
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,340
um and it can help you create like

684
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,679
graphs and charts and like it it's

685
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,000
basically like

686
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,760
all the stuff that maybe you used in

687
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,039
PowerPoint at some point growing up uh

688
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,039
based off of the Excel data so once you

689
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,600
have the data in there it's it's pretty

690
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,140
easy and if your company has you know

691
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,240
data engineering or Analytics

692
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,059
just make them help you until you get

693
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,299
good

694
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,740
all right folks that's been great Leaf

695
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,460
