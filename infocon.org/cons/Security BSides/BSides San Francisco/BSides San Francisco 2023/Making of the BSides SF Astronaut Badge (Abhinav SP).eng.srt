1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,360
all right hello everyone thank you for

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,480
coming out for b-sides this is our first

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,420
year of villages talks uh of hopefully

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,300
many more I'm presenting today abhinav

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,639
who will be talking about all of the

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,580
logistics and uh techniques and his

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,160
trial and error of making the astronauts

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,240
badge

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,660
um abhinav is the founder of hackerware

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,900
this is his second year with us as a

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,199
hardware Village in badge Village

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,660
representative I will now go ahead and

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,760
hand it over to abhinav thank you for

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,599
kicking it off for us

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,260
yeah thank you Aaron and good morning to

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,440
all of you uh so I'm here my name is

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,180
abhinav I'm here to tell a story about

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,120
how we made the astronaut badge if you

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,460
guys haven't seen it we have it in the

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,739
bash Village

21
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,000
uh so little bit about me I combine

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,220
electronic art with Hardware hacking and

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,100
I make badges uh for conferences around

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,680
the world so we have been

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,960
um present across not 12. I really lost

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,000
account I think it's 12 countries so far

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,820
and lots of big conferences in like

28
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,659
Defcon and HTTP and code blue root con

29
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,380
and uh all sorts of events

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,780
um after this conference I will also be

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,820
at the RSA we have made the RSA badge as

32
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,439
well so if you guys are on maybe you

33
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,220
want to say hi there uh so there's a lot

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,020
of people ask me how I just got into

35
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,960
this thing uh so when I was in college I

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,939
really didn't like the the way college

37
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,340
did things like I I found it like

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,700
creativity and all so I got frustrated

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,320
and then one day I just went like I'm

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,420
gonna drop out of college and that's

41
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,000
what I did and back then one of the

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,140
Indian conference they wanted to make

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,200
badges but they absolutely uh didn't

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,439
have any uh way or means to make it

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,479
happen because it's just so complicated

46
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,280
to do things and manufacturers not want

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,140
to talk to you they're gonna throw lots

48
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,119
of stuff at you and they'll bring up

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,280
funded issues with you know why they

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
design they can't do the design or if

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,660
they can do the design they have certain

52
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,360
issues and all so that's how I got

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,760
started we made I made badges for an

54
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,200
Indian conference first and then

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,800
eventually uh I made badges for Defcon

56
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,420
China there was a village in Defcon

57
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,720
China and that's how it started rolling

58
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,660
and I began expanding to more and more

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,700
countries and more and more conferences

60
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,060
so this is my second year at besides SF

61
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,640
I'm really thankful to the crew for

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,099
having me back and last year we had a

63
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,140
phenomenal rubber ducky Village you know

64
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,319
we made this inspired by the California

65
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,340
and uh I forgot the trees name yeah so

66
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,400
so it was in like a tree design rubber

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,459
ducky badge last year uh

68
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,640
so when I started thinking about making

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,400
the badges for this year the the natural

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,220
instinct is what's the theme and the

71
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,680
theme was putting cyber in the space and

72
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,200
I was really glad because I was I am a

73
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,720
space Enthusiast myself so I was super

74
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,760
excited uh that they would choose this

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,319
name and

76
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,920
um again we didn't want to do just a

77
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,440
blinky batch because uh it's just a

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
blinky batch and we wanted to bring

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,120
something more to it um maybe put some

80
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,819
CTF in it and have some learning done

81
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,620
through it and

82
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,420
um the idea was we'll put some space

83
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,459
facts and space trivia and all in the

84
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,739
city also if you play the CTF you will

85
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,140
come across uh challenges like James

86
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,239
Webb and it will make you go through

87
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,379
some of the NASA resources and things

88
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,560
like that so it's it's fun for even for

89
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,540
people who are not good at Hardware

90
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,000
hacking it's still fun to do this of

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,980
nonetheless

92
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,159
and this was sort of an initial design

93
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,239
um with lot of just a black PCB and a

94
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,280
Cosmic Landscape with you know white

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,599
silk screen and we had a bunch of uh I

96
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,680
wanted to do a bunch of reverse mod LEDs

97
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,160
uh to Glow the planets and all and of

98
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,080
course the USB port of on it uh but what

99
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,560
happened is essentially uh so we have

100
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,860
done Fair number of the PCB badges

101
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,800
before like uh if I were to go to my

102
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,160
website it has lot of the previous uh

103
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,340
badges that we did and a lot of times we

104
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,080
manage this if you see this batch we

105
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,500
managed uh the shades by basically we

106
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,600
print the white shade and then we print

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,400
the red and then we print the black and

108
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,840
then we print the red so you get a

109
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,300
lighter red and then you get a darker

110
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,699
red and stuff like that

111
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,540
um

112
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,460
and that's what how we try to maximize

113
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,280
the design in that way

114
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,580
um by just layering the color the ink

115
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,040
layers on top of one another and the

116
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,900
thing was because over the six years of

117
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,000
time we built our in-house lab so we

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,740
have our own machines to do everything

119
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,160
now so we had the freedom and

120
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,160
um uh we had the freedom and time to do

121
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,680
all sorts of these things and pay lot of

122
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,740
attention to detail but yeah it still

123
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,800
was lot of tedious

124
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,180
process to go through each design is

125
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,759
customized then each design is you have

126
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,979
to work through it and all

127
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,479
and so I started wondering uh what do I

128
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,759
do if I want to go beyond it I just I

129
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,280
just don't wanna uh just do the shades

130
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,680
like you know darker or red and

131
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,340
um

132
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,060
and then so one of my friend he was in a

133
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,720
trade show and he overheard that uh he

134
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
was seeing a machine like a Euro

135
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,139
printing machine and he overheard it can

136
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,620
print on any surface and then it kind of

137
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,820
ignited the bulb I'm not here it was

138
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,100
like okay if it can print on any surface

139
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,520
can it print on the pcbs and so we

140
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,940
started doing the test uh so I already

141
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,380
had the artwork uh we made this t-shirt

142
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,500
sign hoodies uh before like the one I'm

143
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,360
wearing right now um

144
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,580
in a moon and mass version you know it

145
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,819
just hacked the planet theme and I I

146
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,240
really like the artwork so uh so we made

147
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,720
like a a customized version of it and

148
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,680
which shows this thing so we just uh put

149
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,020
some elements on it for the CTF so we

150
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,199
have the rockets and ISS and then

151
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,380
Supernova colonized planet and all and

152
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,259
the whole idea was Will you will write a

153
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,720
CTF that essentially gives you a feeling

154
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,680
of us or running a space mission so

155
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,780
solving the first challenge glows the

156
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,060
rocket and then the second one it will

157
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,160
put you on the ISS and there it has

158
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,039
challenges to do with James Webb and you

159
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,620
know all sort of stuff uh so this was

160
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,180
the design and

161
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,340
um the astronaut and the Mars kind of

162
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,699
theme and both the CTF and the design

163
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,880
had to go hand in hand with this theme

164
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,919
um so he started doing some early

165
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,360
testing

166
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,979
um

167
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:32,280
we always been focused on making PCB

168
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,280
single-sided that the reason was I

169
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,380
really like just having a clean PCB look

170
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,479
on the front side

171
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,139
um

172
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,699
and then the components and everything

173
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,940
on the back side so uh this was like one

174
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,280
of the early stage testing we did with

175
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,440
the colors and all and it was having

176
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,500
this matte finish by default and in in

177
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,940
the UV printing there's a technique

178
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,979
called lacquer coating and if you

179
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,039
do the lacquer coating it has the glossy

180
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,660
finish on it

181
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,380
um

182
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,840
and this was the first prototype we

183
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,020
built and it had quite a few issues with

184
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,680
it uh mainly the issue was uh there was

185
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,580
very inconsistent white print uh in UV

186
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,520
Printing and of course one of the issue

187
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,379
that I later on got to know was the most

188
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,960
common with u printing on PCB was that

189
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,419
it turns yellowish so one of the process

190
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,199
in assembly what you do is you for the

191
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,300
soldering you put the board through a

192
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,080
very high intensity kind of a thing

193
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,659
and the UV printing reacts to it in a in

194
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,760
a way that it turns the color yellowish

195
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,299
and so on and that was one of the key

196
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,360
issue we were trying to solve and again

197
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,820
there was this inconsistent print area

198
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,220
it was shifting a lot from what we

199
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,220
wanted uh and these were just bunch of

200
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,860
early issues we had with it uh and the

201
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,880
way

202
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,920
we solve it is first and foremost we

203
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,980
um we we bought out the techniques from

204
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,140
both the old PCB making and then also

205
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,420
the new ones that we were doing and

206
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,660
essentially what we did is we masked the

207
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,240
PCB so on the back side we had the

208
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,160
black masking and in the front side we

209
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,620
had the white masking and on top of the

210
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,300
white masking we would go on to print

211
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,240
the UV printing on it so as a result

212
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,399
what happens is we

213
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,339
fixed that white tissue which was the

214
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,680
inconsistent white print that's how we

215
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
could fix it

216
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,080
um

217
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,420
and then the second one was we we could

218
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,339
put a reference point when we were

219
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,220
assembling so let's also face the shift

220
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,200
issue which is like the artwork not

221
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,380
matching the PCB size and then finally

222
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,240
uh for the LEDs we just put it open on

223
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,240
both the masking so as a result we have

224
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
the LED is glowing from the back side uh

225
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,540
if you can check it here the LED is

226
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,820
broken from the back side but then the

227
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,120
glow also comes out on the front side

228
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,300
um and yeah that that fixed uh half the

229
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,899
issues and those with especially with

230
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,260
the color correction and all uh and then

231
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,540
the second one the the yellow strain

232
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,120
tissue which is extremely common with

233
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,940
people trying to do sort of this stuff

234
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,760
uh and most

235
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,480
um

236
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,580
people I talk to they really couldn't

237
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,000
fix it uh but we were able to fix it and

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,820
the the way we were able to do it is so

239
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,880
in the in the Reflow oven which is the

240
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,060
process for soldering the components

241
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,720
um

242
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,060
and the Machine you can do this profile

243
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,160
and it's basically how much is the

244
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,480
conveyors paid how much is the wind

245
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,860
speed and the temperature and everything

246
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,040
uh uh we did so many experiments and

247
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,800
then had so many fails

248
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,060
um so the the problem is if you put the

249
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,339
temperature too high the boat turns

250
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,140
yellow is for sure and then if the

251
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,240
temperature is too low then it's not

252
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,120
gonna solo properly

253
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,880
so we just kept experimenting and

254
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,980
experimenting and then trying to find

255
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,860
this sweet spot where the components are

256
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,019
soldered but at the same time there's no

257
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,899
allotted issues happening and eventually

258
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,959
we are able to uh find that sweet spot

259
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,180
and we were like yeah we found the

260
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,399
profile and then we made like two copies

261
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,220
of it just to be on safe side

262
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,860
um and noted it down you know history

263
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,680
books and so on uh so

264
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,279
and once we did that so uh we UV printed

265
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,100
the artwork so we black masked on back

266
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,019
side and then white mask on the front

267
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,360
side and then UV print the entire Auto

268
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,000
conference side and then you put it

269
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,640
through the Reflow one and solder it and

270
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:00,500
oops Yeah and I'm going to go ahead and

271
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,320
focus do not disturb yeah

272
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,399
and so yeah so the take on the PCB now

273
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,519
which is uh we have

274
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,200
uh

275
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,180
moved away from so some of the previous

276
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,920
data badges they featured achieved from

277
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,420
a company called a both

278
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,940
we have moved away from them now

279
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,820
um and we have started using note on

280
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,279
part of the reason is we wanted to have

281
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,600
some

282
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,839
proper support from those companies and

283
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:32,880
note on was the one they were like we'll

284
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
send you engineer to your site and he

285
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,660
will install a software and he'll be

286
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,820
there what do you need it from us and

287
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,140
you know just use our chips and you're

288
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,760
like okay fine I will give you a chance

289
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,040
and yeah it turns out I'm glad it turned

290
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,240
out very well

291
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,880
um they have good support and

292
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,120
[Music]

293
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,760
um

294
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,160
architecture and

295
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,220
we put the micro USB for a very quick

296
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,380
interfacing so even if you don't solve

297
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,899
the challenges here you can just go home

298
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,660
and you just need a micro USB cable and

299
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,579
you should be able to connect your

300
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,019
system and then you should be able to

301
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,519
play the CTF there are pads for uh

302
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,220
reprogramming if you want to dive into

303
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,200
that rabbit hole

304
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,920
um

305
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,260
and then data and maybe your Hardware

306
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,160
hacking pleasure and then we have a

307
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,680
customer server header as well uh

308
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,079
we did it again because I didn't want to

309
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,660
drill any holes on the board

310
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,899
so we it's a very custom SEO design it's

311
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:35,760
not the conventional one you will see in

312
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,100
batch life and of course all of it is

313
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,779
powered by the coin sale because that's

314
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,560
easiest thing and most suitable

315
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,279
um

316
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,019
so yeah this was pretty much the tech

317
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:46,940
and

318
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,980
there's a switch for you to turn it off

319
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,800
before connecting the badge and yeah

320
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,920
that's pretty much it so we soldered the

321
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,800
LEDs upside down once again these are

322
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,839
just the standard LEDs

323
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,940
um

324
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,519
so and this was the final form when

325
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,240
everything was done so

326
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,279
this is how it looks when all the

327
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,380
challenges are solved

328
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,120
um it doesn't show the essay although

329
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,100
but you can get this if you solve the

330
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,320
challenges here and just show the badge

331
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,700
that you have sold all changes will give

332
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,560
you the SEO it's like an alien abduction

333
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,060
yourself

334
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,279
um and this is how it looks when all of

335
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,139
it is done and ready

336
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,220
so now designing the SEO so which is uh

337
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,279
again as I said you didn't want to drill

338
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,720
the holes on the board so they it had to

339
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,779
be an like SMD mounted

340
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,440
and we did Fair number of

341
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,560
experimentation with it we tried to

342
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,560
try to see how we can mount it without

343
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,380
going the conventional way and it's just

344
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,600
it's just a single LED that's glowing

345
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,019
this abduction effect uh if you call if

346
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,579
you want to call it

347
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:00,480
um

348
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,360
and the initial one yeah and that was

349
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,660
the idea but uh so if you use the pth

350
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,540
LED it's going to not mourn properly it

351
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,600
was mounting like uh diagonal sort of

352
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,060
almost and then

353
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,160
we tried with the SMD LED but it wasn't

354
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,620
having the full glow it was just like a

355
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,440
pinpoint glow and but that fixed like

356
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,459
just the same uh so how do you fix it we

357
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,639
basically extended the leads and then

358
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:30,420
um

359
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,699
put a really nice urge ability on it so

360
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,339
it has this really cool alien abduction

361
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,199
effect

362
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,899
um so yeah but you know stuff like this

363
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,959
uh we always try to

364
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,540
see what new things we can do or not

365
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,820
what Innovative things we can do a lot

366
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,880
of time it's you can argue it's tacky

367
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,220
and I would agree it is a little tacky

368
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,300
but

369
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,240
um the whole point is how we can push

370
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,760
the boundaries of patch life and

371
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,420
try to do unique things and try to try

372
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,399
to experiment with what works and what

373
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,040
doesn't work and thankfully everything

374
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,920
works in this batch

375
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,540
so hopefully next one also was just the

376
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,199
same

377
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,820
uh uh so yeah so the best city of Seoul

378
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,480
um

379
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,320
is built on the

380
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,980
serial monitor setup that we have always

381
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,180
used so you can

382
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,639
use any serial monitor you like you can

383
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,339
use the terminal you need to know the

384
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,920
right tools to connect the batch but if

385
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,480
you don't you just want to get started

386
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,519
with it as a newbie you can download

387
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,620
Arduino which is the open source ID

388
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,959
to code these chips and

389
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,940
in the Arduino you can just select the

390
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,459
right port and that gets you started

391
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:55,259
it's it's like it takes like two minutes

392
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,660
to get started and that's what we

393
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,940
essentially want you're gonna make more

394
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,399
and more people to participate and more

395
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,400
and more make it accessible for majority

396
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,500
of people to get into it if not everyone

397
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,959
to get into it you just need to have

398
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,880
interest to do things

399
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,540
um

400
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,280
so the city of uh again it's uh

401
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,040
it's not too technical on purpose it's

402
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,599
just

403
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,400
um how to explain it it's more like a

404
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,260
puzzle uh

405
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,780
so you just need to think bit creative

406
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,660
so it's it has crypto puzzles then it

407
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,760
has ocean time it has techno puzzles on

408
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,780
it uh again nothing too difficult to

409
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,240
solve if you just if you know how to

410
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,320
Google things it should be fairly simple

411
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,360
uh again turn off the badge before you

412
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,160
connect the USB because you don't want

413
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,860
to risk it uh and again it won't work

414
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,860
the CTF by Design so you need to you

415
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,000
know turn off the batch before

416
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,760
connection so uh yeah and as usual we

417
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,100
have the three star thing you open the

418
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,679
serial monitors in three stars and the

419
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,140
badge goes into this CTF mode and on the

420
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,840
CTF mode uh it prints out this so we

421
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,200
build lot of ASCII art as well in it so

422
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,620
uh maybe any fans of you know 80s

423
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,320
terminal era uh you guys really gonna

424
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,440
appreciate the asciard

425
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,880
so it's built in that and there's a lot

426
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,559
of um

427
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,640
design and like rockets and ISS done in

428
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,980
SKR for each challenge has asked uh

429
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,320
so uh yeah and if you solve as I said if

430
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,660
you saw all the challenges you get the

431
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,200
SEO the alien abduction SEO and uh and

432
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,600
the fun part is to reset the badge you

433
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,039
have to send the command black hole

434
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,419
that's it so you just type the black

435
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,640
hole and send it and that resets it and

436
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,880
you just connect the batch again

437
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,340
and of course it's me from the last

438
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,340
having my lunch because I didn't get

439
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,400
time uh but yeah so we have the badge

440
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,179
Village to uh encourage the CTF and the

441
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,240
programming aspect of it uh try to get

442
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,000
people into some of the crypto

443
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,980
challenges and you know taking the

444
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,919
challenges in it uh we have plenty of

445
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,880
laptops to for you to try on then we of

446
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,280
course we want to hand out the seos you

447
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,679
will also get the badge there we have I

448
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,460
think 250 Something badges to hand out

449
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,220
without any cost so just only have to

450
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,100
have interest and that should be done

451
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,840
and yeah let's celebrate the bash life

452
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,200
and put cyber in space uh so if you need

453
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,260
any CTF or support or anything you it's

454
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,140
right on this link uh and then there is

455
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,780
a slack challenge if you just slack

456
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,660
channel on the research SF and there's

457
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,580
this bad CTF channel so you can just go

458
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,640
ahead and ask us queries there we'll be

459
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,980
here for entire two days so if you have

460
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,539
any issues for two days I'll be here and

461
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,840
if not you can text me on I don't know

462
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,880
Twitter or any any way you want you can

463
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,220
text and that should be fine and this is

464
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,200
the website so on the website as well

465
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,000
there is a contact form and email and

466
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,700
everything so uh yeah that should be it

467
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,020
I think

468
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,919
thanks a lot for coming to the talk it's

469
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,440
my first talk in U.S and I hope you

470
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,360
liked it so if you have any questions

471
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,700
we'll take questions for

472
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,039
five minutes if not then I will be just

473
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,200
around the badge Village

474
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,360
yeah anyway anybody okay

475
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,799
I was just wondering what is what was

476
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,840
the cost of the badge run about how much

477
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,059
is it per unit

478
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,760
uh cost of the bedroom yeah

479
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,160
um cost per unit and kind of total just

480
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,140
curious

481
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,740
um yeah I think we probably had some run

482
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,020
25 or something with the badger and yeah

483
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,080
and that's again because this was the

484
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,200
first time one of the thing is as I said

485
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,500
uh when I first time when I saw the uh

486
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,220
the UV printing uh samples I was so sold

487
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,320
out we went ahead and purchased the UA

488
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,120
printing machine so we imported it and

489
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,039
that was I don't know fifteen thousand

490
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,520
dollars for the machine but I was very

491
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,380
glad because we could now do the full

492
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,380
color pcbs and the the rest of the

493
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,000
badges we are doing this year all of

494
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,100
them are probably going to be full color

495
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,799
as well uh so yeah there you go yeah

496
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:35,700
