1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
hi everyone

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,560
um just I'll introduce myself and talk a

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,359
little bit about what I'm going to talk

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,639
about so my name is Hannah Zao I'm a

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,800
Staff attorney at the Electronic

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,139
Frontier Foundation

7
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,000
um I actually studied computer science

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,100
undergrad before I went to law school

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,440
and

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,439
um I work at eff I work on digital

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,420
surveillance privacy issues and

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,279
unreliable police technology so those

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,080
are my areas and I'm also a part of the

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,320
coders rights team where we consult uh

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,960
help with security researchers and I'll

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,399
talk a little bit more about that

17
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,420
towards the end of my talk so

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,320
um

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,180
as you can see this talk is called

20
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,340
scraping After High Q versus LinkedIn

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,379
Haiku versus LinkedIn obviously was a

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,960
big case in the ninth circuit what we're

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,239
going to focus on is in the past couple

24
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,219
of years there's been reinterpretations

25
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,579
and the Supreme Court has had a a case

26
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,420
on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act the

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,000
cfaa so we're going to talk a little bit

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,600
about what kind of things when you do

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,060
scraping is going to be more likely to

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,920
bring you into legal risk and what kind

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,020
of things you might do to make sure

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,420
you're less likely to get sued by other

33
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,659
people

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,640
so first I have to give the disclaimer

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,280
this is not legal advice please don't

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,100
take it as legal advice if you have

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,380
legal questions please do not ask me

38
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,420
right now if something is legal or if

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,920
you're in trouble

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,960
um if you come to the eff Booth we'll

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,000
give you a card you can email info

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,979
eff.org

43
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,560
I promise you somebody reads all of the

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,780
emails I guess sent there it'll get

45
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,479
referred to the attorneys who work on

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,220
the specific issue that you're asking

47
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,460
about and then we'll read it

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,560
um please also don't you know vaguely

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,079
disguise your scenario now during the or

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,299
during the Q a saying I have a friend

51
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,880
who maybe did this thing please don't do

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,280
that again email us so that we can have

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
attorney-climb privilege and nothing you

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,258
say will uh be held against you

55
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,980
so law is dynamic I'm sure we have seen

56
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,020
a lot of changes a lot or things that we

57
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,180
thought were law or rights and then they

58
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,980
get overturned by courts and they're no

59
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,220
longer law or rights so I'm not going to

60
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,140
use really definitive terms like don't

61
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,660
do this do this this is you know this is

62
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,400
legal this is illegal I'm going to use

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,739
terms more like this will give you

64
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,720
higher risk this will lower your risk

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,620
things like that and lastly and somewhat

66
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,440
importantly is that nothing will keep

67
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,360
companies from acting like you know

68
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,660
spoil little children and trying to

69
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,300
harass you or sue you you know they

70
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,879
can't do certain they can't be uh go

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,620
beyond certain lies they can't cross

72
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,140
them but in terms of filing a case

73
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,060
against you if they really want to put

74
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,099
all their resources and time into doing

75
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,780
that and they are paying a lot of money

76
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,599
to do that they can do that now it's

77
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,459
unlikely unless they're really really

78
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,080
mad about something or trying to make a

79
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,739
point but that's another reason why your

80
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,680
risks will be probably higher than or

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,379
like they're always existent because

82
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,300
even if you end up winning on those

83
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,400
lawsuits they might be annoying to deal

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
with

85
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,239
so what we're going to talk about when

86
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,159
we actually talk about scraping in this

87
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,440
talk specifically is the act of scraping

88
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,800
though web crawling the Gathering the

89
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,440
data from websites and we're now going

90
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,379
to be talking about actually publishing

91
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,720
that data or using that data in other

92
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,659
ways putting it on your own website or

93
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,220
anything else we're just talking about

94
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,799
what if you use these automatic scrapers

95
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,299
to get information from websites

96
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,760
um the other things that I was talking

97
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,680
about that's outside the scope of this

98
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,140
talk those actually entail a lot of

99
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,799
other cool pile of legal risks including

100
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,220
copyright trademark Trade Secrets all

101
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,780
that stuff that's not going to come into

102
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,040
play we're going to talk mostly about

103
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,939
cfaa with a mention of some of the state

104
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:18,060
law that comes into play as well

105
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,699
so cfaa as I mentioned before the

106
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,280
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act so this was

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,120
enacted in 1986 expanded in 1984 because

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,940
President Reagan watched war games that

109
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,440
movie

110
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,540
um and it was originally focused on

111
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,300
protecting government computers from

112
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,340
hacking because if you watch war games

113
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,460
that's what that movie was about

114
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,100
um now a productive computer is much

115
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,500
much more expansive it's basically any

116
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,380
electronic device that has processing or

117
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,580
storage

118
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,220
and I guess we can call this fact fun

119
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,600
but the 2021 Tia 84 plus a calculator is

120
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,419
more powerful than most 1986 era

121
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,940
computers so this is how the definition

122
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,860
of computers has expanded

123
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,699
so like I said we're going to touch a

124
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,820
little bit on state anti-hacking laws

125
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,240
um so in all 50 states Puerto Rico and

126
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,919
the Virgin Islands they all have their

127
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,199
own computer crime laws a lot of them

128
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,620
are structured similarly to the cfaa and

129
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,360
the type of things that they address

130
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
would be

131
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,699
unauthorized access and also what is

132
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,639
called Loosely computer trespass so they

133
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,039
borrow this theory of trespass from

134
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,720
normal property you know like when

135
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
someone comes onto your property without

136
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,500
permission and they borrow that legal

137
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,240
concept and used it in these computer

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,180
crime laws now eff we're really against

139
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,940
this we think it is a really outdated

140
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,400
way of thinking about what it means to

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,280
access a computer but unfortunately

142
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,500
there are some state laws that have that

143
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,360
and this is part of the reason why these

144
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,580
laws are even more restrictive than the

145
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,840
cfaa

146
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,039
so um this is a one of the dangers when

147
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,380
you do scraping even though you know

148
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,539
obviously eff's position is that

149
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,060
scraping public data as public you

150
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,979
should be able to access it whether it

151
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,500
is through web crawling or whether it is

152
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,380
your handwriting on every note of every

153
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,259
page that you visit on the internet all

154
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,300
of that should be okay but because of

155
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,160
these other Concepts that come into play

156
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,600
in the state laws there can be some

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,960
risks that you would have if you're in

158
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,060
the states that have

159
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,759
you know more restrictive state laws so

160
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,979
one example of that state is in fact

161
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,039
California unfortunately

162
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,639
um California the penoko section 508 of

163
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,400
502 it was interpreted in the friends

164
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,860
for Fullerton versus Fullerton case and

165
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,680
this was a where uh the friends for

166
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,900
Fullerton were charged under the

167
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,560
California state statute section 508 for

168
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,199
their scraping of data

169
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,039
um and it was a uh really bad decision

170
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:10,979
eff filed some briefs in that arguing

171
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,639
against the implementation of 502 or

172
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,120
that interpretation of 502 but

173
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,620
um you know unfortunately it resulted in

174
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,020
um some restrictions but that's not

175
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,520
going to come into play for the public

176
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,539
data that we're talking about here

177
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:35,280
so uh a little while ago there was uh a

178
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,180
case

179
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,400
um Van Buren versus United States now

180
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,740
this case was not about scraping at all

181
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,259
but it did it was the first case that

182
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,300
the Supreme Court decided that was about

183
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,680
the cfaa so if you remember cfaa passed

184
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,880
a while ago

185
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,039
um this is the first case the Supreme

186
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,500
Court has taken to interpret this law

187
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,960
took them a really long time to get

188
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,120
there but because of that it's a very

189
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,979
very important case when we think about

190
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,699
is what you're doing going to get uh

191
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,039
civil or criminal suits against you

192
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,240
under the cfaa so the way that

193
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,460
um Van Buren talks about it is the cfaa

194
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,580
prevents unauthorized access or the kind

195
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,060
of access that exceeds authorization so

196
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,039
what does that mean well the Supreme

197
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,419
Court said that basically if you they

198
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,339
took a gates up versus Gates down

199
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,679
approach so if the gates are up if it is

200
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,500
open you're allowed to access it then

201
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,719
even if you weren't supposed to but you

202
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,020
you could and you do then that's not a

203
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,700
violation of the cfaa it might be a

204
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,560
violation of other laws so what that

205
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,500
means is in this case for example there

206
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,519
was a police officer who was looking in

207
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,440
this database for some information that

208
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,940
they were selling to other people it's

209
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,500
kind of a complicated thing but

210
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,300
basically they had access to this

211
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,040
database they were authorized to use

212
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,620
this database as a police officer they

213
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,420
weren't authorized to use that database

214
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,100
to get this information to sell it to

215
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,800
someone else and do all of that so the

216
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,300
government argued this was a violation

217
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,820
of the CIA FAA that the way in which he

218
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,160
accessed it and the purpose for which he

219
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,380
did it was inappropriate and therefore

220
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,620
it was without access now eff's position

221
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,260
is no the it might be a violation of

222
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,940
other laws but under the cfaa he had

223
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,800
authorization he was authorized to look

224
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,120
at this data and the Supreme Court

225
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,820
agreed that he was in fact authorized to

226
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,220
look at this data so it wasn't a

227
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,560
violation of the CFA so what this means

228
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,040
is that basically if you have access to

229
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,320
data so for example public websites

230
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,959
anyone can visit public websites well

231
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,600
almost anyone can visit public websites

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,839
you have that ability therefore you have

233
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,240
the authorization to visit that website

234
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,339
therefore when you take information from

235
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,339
that website that is okay

236
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,600
then um you know this is a uh way of

237
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,880
thinking about the law that eff agrees

238
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,459
with that we liked but there's this

239
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,920
issue where there is footnote 8 which

240
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,899
suggests that there can be a withdrawal

241
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,180
of authorization so when we're talking

242
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,700
about scraping if you're authorized to

243
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,459
access the data so like a public website

244
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,740
you can scrape it but what does it mean

245
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,620
in the context of a website to withdraw

246
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,600
authorization

247
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,000
the Supreme Court did not explain

248
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,459
footnote a confounds a lot of lawyers

249
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,740
that's probably gonna um you know be

250
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,779
able to fund a lot of lawyers salaries

251
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,640
for the next couple of years as this is

252
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,920
litigated out exactly where the confines

253
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,899
of this withdrawing access

254
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,899
uh means but that is one of the things

255
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,240
that you would have to worry about so

256
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,060
what do we mean when we say with a

257
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,399
withdrawal authorization how can you

258
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,860
withdraw authorization from a public

259
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,800
website that you're scraping

260
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,560
so and the incomes High Q versus

261
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,720
LinkedIn so high Q in versus LinkedIn

262
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,779
began before The Supreme Court took of

263
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,540
Van Buren but it also continued after

264
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,380
Van Buren so high Q was basically a data

265
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,019
analytics company that was scraping

266
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,779
LinkedIn website for information so that

267
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,700
they could use it in their beta data

268
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,940
analytics and sell it to businesses

269
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,100
um LinkedIn decided they kind of want

270
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,380
that had been letting High Q do this but

271
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,940
then decided they basically wanted to

272
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,560
make the same kind of product they were

273
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,300
like we have all this info why don't we

274
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,880
just make money by building data

275
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,420
analytics off of it so then it sent a

276
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,220
cease and desist letter so the question

277
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,560
is when you are scraping public

278
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
information but you get a cease and

279
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
desist letter does that withdraw the

280
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,019
authorization that you originally had

281
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,640
eff's position is obviously as I

282
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,980
mentioned before no because this is a

283
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,980
public website you can't you know the

284
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,380
gates are up for everyone so if the

285
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,000
gates are not down so therefore this

286
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,420
cannot be a violation of the cfaa

287
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,399
um but LinkedIn argued this and then um

288
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,519
the ninth circuit actually prior to Van

289
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,560
Buren coming out from the Supreme Court

290
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,279
said agreed with eff said this is not a

291
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,860
violation of the cfaa but after Van

292
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,160
Buren was decided High Q was also up on

293
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,079
appeal at the Supreme Court and the

294
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,000
Supreme Court said hey we just decided

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,220
this case in Van Buren we're gonna put

296
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,680
this back in the ninth circuit you

297
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,200
redecided based on what we said in Van

298
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,740
Buren so the ninth circuit

299
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,519
looked at it again in high Q2

300
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,100
um they said that Van Buren's gates up

301
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,620
or down in curry which only applies when

302
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,139
authorization is required and as I said

303
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,779
before if it is public data then

304
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,120
authorization is not required

305
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,660
so that means that um Van Buren

306
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,500
basically its decisions really

307
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,120
reinforced what

308
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,820
um it had originally decided so it again

309
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,899
said that scraping information from

310
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,260
public websites is not a violation of

311
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,779
the cfaa and we're really really happy

312
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,120
about that because if you think about

313
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,639
data there's basically three categories

314
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,040
right there is a category where you only

315
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,740
get access to it through credentials so

316
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,139
you have to you know log in and things

317
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:37,260
like that then there is

318
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,220
um that there are other ones where uh

319
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,660
there are past so there's password

320
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,300
protected and then there are ones where

321
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,220
authorization is given but there's a

322
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,260
third category which is what is open to

323
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,420
the general public so it's not about did

324
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,220
you have authorization to log in it's

325
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,320
that you don't need a login at all

326
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,139
so the what the ninth circuit comes that

327
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,880
they're still litigating this in fact

328
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,200
but

329
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,120
um what they said at the end of last

330
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,540
year was that Haiku is likely to win on

331
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,600
the scraping violating cfaa issue

332
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,600
but um it because it was scraping public

333
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,260
profiles now there's an issue because

334
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,680
haikyuu ended up hiring Turks to

335
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,980
um scrape so basically to build fake

336
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,920
accounts on LinkedIn and scrape the data

337
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,100
that you would only get after you uh law

338
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,680
and you had an account with LinkedIn and

339
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,680
that is a different issue that did

340
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,260
entail higher risk so the course said

341
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,360
that was a violation of the user

342
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,160
agreement so you can what you can see

343
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
here is the more authorization the more

344
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,720
steps you need to take to get that data

345
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,899
the more closed off it is the higher the

346
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:54,959
legal risk that you're taking on when

347
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,820
you decide to scrape that so public

348
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,399
information that is just on the website

349
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,940
totally okay but then if you get down to

350
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,880
you have to log in to access that

351
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,160
information that is a little bit if

352
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,399
you're and especially so if to log in

353
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,440
and to create that account you had to

354
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,060
click you know one of those whenever you

355
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,500
create the account you have to click I

356
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,839
agree to these terms or whatever often

357
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,160
in those terms there will be

358
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,120
prohibitions of scraping data and while

359
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,940
LinkedIn had argued that prevented High

360
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,240
Q from scraping the data even of its

361
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,760
public profiles you know

362
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,980
um it was scraping it but it was a

363
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,839
public profile but they said if they

364
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,339
still created these accounts they still

365
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,060
clicked I agree for these uh contract

366
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,760
terms these user agreements but the

367
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,740
ninth circus said that didn't apply to

368
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,600
the public stuff but to the private

369
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,360
stuff it did and also LinkedIn prohibits

370
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,680
creating fake accounts to well prohibits

371
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,199
fake accounts in its user agreement so

372
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,779
in creating this account in order to do

373
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:03,540
scraping it violated the user agreement

374
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,839
so again when you're scraping data from

375
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,639
websites if it's the kind of website

376
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,620
where you needed credentials and there

377
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,839
was a user agreement where you clicked I

378
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,639
agree to the terms and conditions to

379
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,639
continue that might entail a lot more

380
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,300
risk when you are accessing that data

381
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,680
so

382
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,339
um

383
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,600
as I said uh these triggers who did the

384
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,300
quality assurance while logged into

385
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,060
LinkedIn by viewing and confirming the

386
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,699
the information The District Court

387
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,860
granted linkedin's motion for summary

388
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,920
judgment for this as a pre of contract

389
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,139
so that entails contract law which is

390
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,680
different from the cfaa the cfaa means

391
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,980
is a civil and criminal that means

392
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,440
LinkedIn could sue High Q under it and

393
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,899
also if a prosecutor was really gung-ho

394
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,360
about it could bring criminal charges

395
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,300
under the cfaa that's why the cfaa is

396
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,100
really worrisome because we're not just

397
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,380
talking about people losing money or

398
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,059
having to pay money we're talking about

399
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,000
possibly jail

400
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,400
so the lingering concerns we have after

401
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,619
this huge development leading up to even

402
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:16,260
November of last year is

403
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,000
first there are no technology barriers

404
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,459
for for the type of access that you need

405
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,819
to create and account for So in theory

406
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,700
the gates are still up under the Van

407
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,460
Buren's idea of gates up versus Gates

408
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,960
down

409
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,860
the question is is it is uh these types

410
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,620
of crit so Gates down means you know

411
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,000
they have

412
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,940
um technology that is preventing

413
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,000
scraping or that is preventing access to

414
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,360
the information so not just acquiring

415
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,820
authorization but also not just

416
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,679
requiring authorization that anyone can

417
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,200
get everyone can you know get

418
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,720
um can create an account on LinkedIn

419
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,580
with real information

420
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,340
so when there are no technology barriers

421
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,860
does that information count as public

422
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,140
obviously eff's position is that it does

423
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,679
but this is this is unclear so when you

424
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,720
like I said before when you do have to

425
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,299
create account that entails more legal

426
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,419
risk another thing is that doj has a

427
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,900
charging policy so to you know tell its

428
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,120
prosecutors when they should actually be

429
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,580
charging someone with a crime and did

430
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,520
that charging policies considers cease

431
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,440
and desist letters to revoke

432
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,080
authorization but it's unclear if that's

433
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,780
just talking about non-public data or

434
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,380
also public data so when I talk about

435
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,780
your risk going up or going down if you

436
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,539
are scraping even public data if you get

437
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,660
a CSUN assist letter now eff would argue

438
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,640
that is no good

439
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,480
but it is not completely clear whether

440
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,039
that is no good and whether the

441
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,200
Department of Justice considers that to

442
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,480
be no good or does it consider it to be

443
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,660
a valid revocation of the authorization

444
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,240
that you had so that definitely so

445
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,100
scraping after you get a cease and

446
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,020
desist letter that increases your legal

447
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,280
risk

448
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,380
I mentioned the brick of contract claims

449
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,820
and

450
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,539
um also the trespass claims which came

451
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,940
up in high q but uh LinkedIn didn't

452
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,039
really argue it so the nine circus that

453
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,380
we're not deciding this again that's the

454
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,260
kind of thing that um eff's position is

455
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,480
very much against interpreting those

456
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,940
types of trespass laws to apply to

457
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,039
computers and accessing computer

458
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,860
information but this is also kind of a

459
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,539
gray area

460
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,260
so uh what should you do when you

461
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,480
actually come across these types of

462
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,000
issues well the eff has a Carter's

463
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,940
rights project I'm part of it it is a

464
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,500
team a subset of our lawyers who provide

465
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,960
a free Council to security researchers

466
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,960
on legal issues so perhaps you're

467
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,220
conducting some research and you know

468
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,260
you come across something either you

469
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,240
want to disclose bugs or you're like I'm

470
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,820
doing this thing and I'm not sure what

471
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,400
my rights are or where I get into really

472
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,240
murky territory and you are please email

473
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,480
us at info eff.org like I said someone

474
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,480
will read it I promise and

475
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,780
um we also have guys up at eff.org

476
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,700
coders

477
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,799
um and we are able to consult with the

478
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,900
security research community and provide

479
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,840
you with some free advice and counseling

480
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,000
on your situation even if we don't

481
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,860
represent you or do anything for you

482
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,140
that conversation will both a be

483
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,360
privileged and B we will be able to

484
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,340
point you to someone who might be able

485
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,980
to help you so that's the end of the

486
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,160
talk

487
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,640
do we have questions

488
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,120
yes

489
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,559
um it was

490
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,440
so that is a really good question

491
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,179
um

492
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,700
uh yes is adding one of those captchas

493
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,960
to make sure that it is a human and not

494
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,340
um some code they're trying to access

495
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,559
the data it does that

496
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,840
so that um

497
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,840
in terms of revoking authorization it

498
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,179
does not but it does give them you know

499
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,900
it yes for the rest of it so it in of

500
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,419
itself the existence of that were not

501
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:11,520
necessarily suggests that there's a

502
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,799
revocation of authorization therefore

503
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,600
shouldn't change the legal risk that

504
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,940
you're taking on whether that exists but

505
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,159
if you have signed a user agreement and

506
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,200
the user agreement in there says things

507
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,000
like you cannot use automatic

508
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,700
subscribers this might be something that

509
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,260
comes into play in the breach of

510
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,158
contract claims

511
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,299
hi there uh can terms of service

512
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,820
uh

513
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,640
deny authorization to access a public

514
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,120
website

515
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,320
um but it is you know based on the law

516
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,380
right now it is probably unlikely that

517
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,000
it can be used for that there may be

518
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,559
issues with

519
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,780
um contractual

520
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,080
sorry there may be issues with uh Contra

521
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,780
like I said user agreement like the EULA

522
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,640
issues that come into play the breach of

523
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,340
contract claims but it looks right now

524
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,820
it is that is not very effective now

525
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,440
again this can be wrong like I said

526
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,880
there will be a lot of litigation about

527
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,220
what footnote it meant and that is one

528
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,480
of the worries although the the direct

529
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,460
uh opinion of Van Buren actually

530
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,100
suggests that that is not like that's

531
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,840
not effective that having that in the

532
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,039
toss is not going to be effective yeah

533
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,980
so yes so his question was what if the

534
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,640
terms of service includes that you can't

535
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,159
scrape data from the public website

536
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,340
so uh my answer was if you clicked the I

537
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,320
agree thing there might be contract

538
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,299
issues but

539
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,280
um it looks like from Van Buren that

540
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,500
should not be a problem that you should

541
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,720
still be able to scrape it even though

542
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,220
the terms of service says no

543
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,500
uh any other questions we have time for

544
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,720
one more question

545
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,179
has there been any legal cases or

546
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,640
Research into like for instance where

547
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,240
the New York Times they allow the Google

548
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,880
crawler to see all of their articles and

549
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,159
there's websites that'll go and grab

550
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:24,720
them for you

551
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,659
yeah so they're I'm not aware of the

552
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,600
legal cases of that but there is

553
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,700
um both in the doj charging policy and

554
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,260
in Van Buren there's some suggestion

555
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,900
that essentially the type of frame that

556
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,640
New York Times has is there is no

557
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,380
authorization but we will grant

558
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,780
authorization to specific parties so

559
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,880
like for Google crawlers to get it so

560
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,860
it's okay for Google to but it is not

561
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,020
okay for someone that the New York Times

562
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,600
didn't say it's okay too because they

563
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,220
have decided that their information is

564
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,480
going to be behind a paywall

565
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,780
okay

566
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:05,159
do you want to do one more okay remember

567
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,700
one more

568
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,380
describing where the case was against

569
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,440
the person who had done the scraping how

570
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,360
does that match in with what you're

571
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,240
describing I'm sorry can you repeat the

572
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,580
question sorry I didn't hear well

573
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,799
haven't there been some cases that were

574
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,960
decided against a person who did the

575
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,240
scraping didn't I'm assuming that those

576
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,520
preceded these decisions so they're in

577
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,380
contradiction with each other yeah yeah

578
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,659
so for example friends versus Fullerton

579
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,700
they found them

580
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,919
um so friends for Fullerton was found to

581
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,440
be in violation so some of the so the

582
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,080
cases that had interpreted the CFA in a

583
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,940
different way from Van Buren those cases

584
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,440
are overturned and they're not good

585
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,299
anymore but

586
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,299
um if it is under a state law like the

587
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,039
friends for Fullerton case where it's

588
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,080
about the California state law those

589
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,480
those are problematic and those are

590
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,799
something you would have to worry about

591
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,900
so yes where you're doing the scraping

592
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,360
and where that information is that also

593
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,279
changes how much legal risk you have

594
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,380
so all right thank you very much thank

595
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,620
you okay
