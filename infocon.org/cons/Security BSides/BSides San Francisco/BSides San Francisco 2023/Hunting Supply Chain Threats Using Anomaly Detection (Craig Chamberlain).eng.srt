1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,800
so thanks for coming to my talk my name

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,300
is Craig Chamberlain

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,980
and this talk is called hunting Cloud

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,420
Supply Chain threats using anomaly

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,280
detection

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,599
um my

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,900
I have a long version of my my biography

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,099
and my introduction but the short

9
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,599
version I can give you is what happened

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,160
is um

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,260
20 years ago I was picked by a security

12
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,180
product startup in the Boston area and

13
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,760
we got the MVP we had a purpose-built

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,740
rule detection language like many

15
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,840
security products do and

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,580
and the next question was well what

17
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,199
should it actually detect like what

18
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,700
should it detect what should alert what

19
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,680
should it do and and nobody wanted to

20
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,180
work on that for various reasons so I

21
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,880
thought it was interesting that we could

22
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,079
do anything but we didn't know what it

23
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,879
should do so I volunteered I kind of

24
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,680
said yolo and volunteered to work on

25
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,379
that and then went on to work on several

26
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,660
more large-scale threat threat hunting

27
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,480
and detection products and projects over

28
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,239
the course of my life and um still doing

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,620
it today

30
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,239
and

31
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,680
this is a talk about

32
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,719
um as far as

33
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,500
um

34
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,439
this is my second time at B-side San

35
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,180
Francisco well it's my second talk here

36
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,820
at B-side SF my talk last year was given

37
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,320
by a colleague because I wasn't able to

38
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,540
be here unfortunately

39
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,220
um this is actually my I think my

40
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,960
seventh piece I to talk now because I

41
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,479
was at um besides Rochester in March

42
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:22,740
um and I've done a bunch of other

43
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,659
conferences I've done uh 14 or 15

44
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,400
conferences

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,259
um lots of Publications basically just

46
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,420
been working on on threat detection for

47
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,580
most of my life

48
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,520
um how I got here is

49
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,520
uh six seven years ago I was doing work

50
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,520
for some of the largest cloud using

51
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,380
organizations in the Boston area where

52
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,619
I'm from and got interested in in threat

53
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:47,759
hunting and detection there and how

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,560
different it was

55
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,899
um along the way I I kind of went on a

56
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,240
walkabout in 2018 and I did a project I

57
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,740
did a detection project in some open

58
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,259
source tooling just for fun

59
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,040
um

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,040
started doing work on

61
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,600
practical applications of machine

62
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,740
learning for threat hunting and

63
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,439
detection in in 2019 that was the

64
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,660
subject of my talk last year and so

65
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,700
continuing to work on

66
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,140
applications of machine learning and

67
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,940
anomaly detection for threat hunting in

68
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,040
general Cloud threat hunting detection

69
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,620
in particular as well as the combination

70
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,140
of of you know new technologies like

71
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,400
machine learning with conventional

72
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,680
detection

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
um the the approach that I like to take

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,819
and I'm going to turn this into probably

75
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,760
a blog post or try to flesh this out and

76
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,500
try to articulate this more but

77
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,080
the approach that I think we need to

78
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,599
take or that I would like to take in

79
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,900
this problem space is um

80
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,519
is to kind of Define a new discipline

81
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,860
and the reason being is because

82
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,160
not many of the existing disciplines um

83
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,220
that we have in in detection engineering

84
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,080
are not exactly what we need in the

85
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,780
cloud world so um network security

86
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,000
monitoring endpoint detection and

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,239
response obviously are you know

88
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,280
absolutely foundational essential

89
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,319
pivotal tools and Technologies

90
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,680
um that that are that we need but there

91
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,780
are there are large areas of cloud

92
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,459
detection where they're just they're

93
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,560
just not that effective because a lot of

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,879
the cloud API activity just simply

95
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,580
doesn't leave host or network evidence

96
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,980
um the reason I don't call it data

97
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,319
science and I I don't plan to become a a

98
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,120
traditional conventional

99
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,459
um a data scientist is

100
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,140
when it comes to threat detection not

101
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,659
everything is a data science problem

102
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,540
um if you can detect a you know there

103
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,220
are some threats we can even even in

104
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,599
this space there are some classes of

105
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,920
threats we can detect with simple

106
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,780
conventional searches and rules and

107
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,560
queries and if we can detect a threat at

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,299
such a low cost as that then that's

109
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,459
that's preferable to spending enormous

110
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,599
time and effort on a machine learning

111
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,239
approach um in other cases there are

112
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,920
areas where we really need complex

113
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,239
machine learning or not the detection

114
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:58,560
Tools in order to find some of these

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,159
things but you know not everything is a

116
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,780
what we call detection engineering

117
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,879
problem in this world not everything is

118
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,500
a data science problem so what we really

119
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,379
need is is to kind of merge the two of

120
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,239
those

121
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,860
so

122
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,900
what I'm going to show here today is

123
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,680
I'm going to show you what I've been

124
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,120
doing over the past year or so as I've

125
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,860
been continuing to do work on anomaly

126
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,900
detection for cloud threat hunting and

127
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,580
Cloud threat detection

128
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,160
and

129
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,860
I want to show you some examples of of

130
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,960
you know kind of articulate how I'm

131
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,660
doing that in some detail and then show

132
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,220
you some of like the the most

133
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,960
interesting examples of what I found so

134
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,800
far one of which is and and the reason I

135
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,740
wrote this talk is

136
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,139
the first time I turned on this this

137
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,000
particular detection

138
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,919
um stacked and tool set that we're going

139
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,120
to see here today the first time I

140
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,699
turned it on on production data I found

141
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,440
something that I wasn't expecting I was

142
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,880
expecting to find possibly some

143
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,500
credentialed access and you know some

144
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,720
more of what I've been seeing I wasn't

145
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,940
expecting to find what I found which was

146
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,320
something kind of new and interesting

147
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,460
and so

148
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,900
um I'll show you what that looks like in

149
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,679
in great detail

150
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,919
so the reason for the Ocean's 11 theme

151
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,620
in this talk is

152
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,060
um if you if you've seen my talks you

153
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,139
know they a lot of them have Movie

154
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,900
themes my my mom was a huge movie Buff

155
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,000
when I was a kid so I grew up as a child

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,100
going to the movies so I guess that's

157
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,960
what happened here but

158
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,400
um the reason for this particular theme

159
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,419
is

160
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,880
what struck me is that it wasn't that

161
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,979
long ago that supply chain attacks were

162
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:40,199
kind of beyond our imagination

163
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,199
why I say that is if we go back more

164
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,500
than a decade ago I'm saying to into the

165
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,680
like 2007 8-9 time period I can remember

166
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
sitting in threat modeling sessions in

167
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,660
you know large financial institutions

168
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,060
with you know large talented very

169
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,759
capable security teams but when it came

170
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,060
to third party or supply chain scenarios

171
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,039
um it was it was simply beyond our

172
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
imagination at that time and one of the

173
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,699
remarks somebody in a meeting once made

174
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,680
a remark and said isn't that something

175
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,199
like an Ocean's 11 scenario and at the

176
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
time it was it was something we hadn't

177
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,740
yet conceived of of course a decade

178
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,900
later and now we've seen

179
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,820
um in in fact just recently now we have

180
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,620
possibly the largest most interesting

181
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,199
example unfolding right now with 3cx

182
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,580
where it appears that there was there

183
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,740
were actually two supply chain attacks

184
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,740
in that in that intrusion set

185
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,759
um

186
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,280
the earliest one is probably 2013 and

187
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,139
Target where there was potentially there

188
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,319
was a apparently a an HVAC vendor or a

189
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,759
third party that was compromised that

190
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,259
had access to the network that was that

191
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,900
was the the nature of the supply chain

192
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,800
there

193
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,060
um or the supply chain intrusion there

194
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,220
of course in 2020 we had Sunburst which

195
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,919
was probably that I mean prior to this

196
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:53,880
year

197
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,100
probably the largest I guess you know it

198
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,840
remains to be seen it's an open question

199
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,479
as to whether Sunburst or 3cx has the

200
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,639
the highest uh cost or impact in the

201
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
long term the RSA breach I include that

202
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,180
because that wasn't exactly a supply

203
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,000
chain attack because as far as I know

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,259
none of the software product there was

205
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,600
was actually poisoned or anything

206
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,979
um I think it was more a case it was

207
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,020
more strategic in that the ultimate

208
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,300
objective there was probably not the the

209
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,400
manufacturer of the two-factor tokens it

210
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,460
was probably one of the users

211
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,639
so we've seen supply chain attacks now

212
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,020
with

213
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,060
a network management product with a

214
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,099
Voiceover IP product

215
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,020
um probably see more of them over the

216
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,580
course of the decade

217
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,340
but what about

218
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,259
one area I think we haven't really

219
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,000
thought about yet is is in the cloud

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,039
Arena because

221
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,560
if you're a cloud user or if you are if

222
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,120
you work with large-scale Cloud users

223
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,940
one of the things I've noticed over just

224
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,580
the last few years is that there are an

225
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,520
increasing number of third parties that

226
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,680
have

227
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,380
some or sometimes a lot of access to

228
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,419
their customers Cloud accounts in order

229
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,240
to deliver Services

230
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,139
sometimes their security services

231
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,120
sometimes they're just management and

232
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,800
orchestration services but they're

233
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,539
delivering services and so sometimes

234
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,340
they have access to prod accounts and

235
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,199
sometimes they have a lot of access

236
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,880
and

237
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,419
Cloud thread hunting and detection is

238
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,780
it's it's hard enough that we've seen

239
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,259
um there there are four there are more

240
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,400
than four

241
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,180
um

242
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,219
examples out in the public record but

243
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,260
there are four large public record

244
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,899
examples and case studies that were big

245
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:37,979
enough that they actually went to

246
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,839
prosecution so we can go and read the

247
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,219
indictments and read about them in great

248
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,559
detail and

249
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,080
the thing that's interesting is that in

250
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,820
in the case studies that I'm going to

251
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,600
show you

252
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,240
I don't think that it I don't think that

253
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,339
the Common Thread is anything to do with

254
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,200
the organizations who experience these

255
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,300
because some of these organizations have

256
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,459
very large very capable very talented

257
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,560
security teams as as you'll probably

258
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,740
realize when you see the names and

259
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,839
I would venture to Guess that that many

260
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,820
of them were probably doing

261
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,800
you know not everything 100 right but

262
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,120
they're probably doing a lot of things

263
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,560
right when it came to security and they

264
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,820
probably did have sophisticated

265
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,620
detection tooling

266
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,779
um but in these four cases there was

267
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:20,339
large-scale X-File that simply went

268
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,580
undetected until it was far along and

269
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,019
you know it was not detected early

270
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,160
enough

271
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,920
and part of the reason is that

272
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,779
most of what we're looking at most of

273
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,040
what we're dealing with most of the time

274
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,200
is not always but most of the time we're

275
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,760
dealing with credentialed access where

276
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,200
credentials have been compromised and

277
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,700
somebody is persisting via credential

278
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,220
access and impersonating a legitimate

279
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,200
user

280
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,440
and that tends to look like

281
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,600
um that starts to look like Insider

282
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,220
threat hunting which is something that I

283
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,560
had worked on earlier in my career and

284
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,420
it's one of the it's one of the harder

285
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,459
things to hunt I think if you look like

286
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,640
if the biggest examples of this uh

287
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,680
possibly are

288
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,000
well there was there was actually

289
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,680
there's another example just recently

290
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,060
where

291
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,339
um there was a

292
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,220
an Air Force employee who released some

293
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,660
classified material into a Discord

294
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,880
server and so now there's a large debate

295
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,200
about you know oh how did this happen

296
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,519
and why did this happen and how is this

297
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,839
detected

298
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,339
um but you know it's it's the second or

299
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:21,779
third time that we've we've seen this

300
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,940
and I think the answer is it's not that

301
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,959
um

302
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,019
it's not that you know something

303
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,640
wasn't done that should have been done

304
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,320
at least I doubt that's the case I think

305
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,660
it's more case that somebody who is

306
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,880
technically illiterate and is very

307
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,800
familiar with the systems that they are

308
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,140
exfiltrating data from and possibly even

309
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,060
familiar with what detection mechanisms

310
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,060
exist and how they might evade detection

311
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,920
um hunting an Insider like that who who

312
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,560
has any degree of sophistication and and

313
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,660
knowledge of the terrain is is a very

314
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,519
difficult thing to successfully hunt and

315
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,640
and find and so when we have credentials

316
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,140
when we have you know smart

317
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,880
sophisticated threat actors who have

318
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,260
obtained credentialed access and Cloud

319
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,760
accounts

320
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,160
um it's sometimes it's it's hard to to

321
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,220
distinguish them from ordinary users so

322
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,079
this is the best

323
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,000
one sentence version of the problem

324
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,920
statement that I've found so far this

325
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,660
actually came from a blog post

326
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,760
um from one of the um from a Blog

327
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,040
related to one of the incidents this is

328
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,300
a better problem statement than anything

329
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,820
that I've come up with in the past a few

330
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,779
years

331
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,959
it's simply that the problem is that

332
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,820
at the end of the day it's very it's

333
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,320
sometimes it's very hard to

334
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,060
differentiate or disambiguate between

335
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,920
threat actor activity and legitimate

336
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,600
user activity

337
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,339
um because we're looking at credentialed

338
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,220
access and the difference between

339
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,360
legitimate and suspicious activity is

340
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,160
it's sometimes it's a matter of nuance

341
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,620
so working backwards through the there

342
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,420
are four big examples

343
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,560
um

344
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,060
there are four examples at least that

345
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,160
were large enough to go well three of

346
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,839
these have gone to prosecution

347
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,760
um the fourth remains to be seen But

348
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,220
most recently in 2023

349
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,760
we saw a case of credentialed access

350
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,320
this one was kind of interesting because

351
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,940
according to what was published

352
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,880
apparently uh there was a developer

353
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,800
laptop that was running a service that

354
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,560
was internet facing and their laptop and

355
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,880
so somebody was able to get execution

356
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,740
and persistence on this laptop and then

357
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,880
from there were able to obtain

358
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,640
credentials to access

359
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,399
um some to not only access cloud data

360
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,360
but to actually some particularly

361
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,220
sensitive cloud data and to exfiltrate

362
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,339
uh the data that they were after and you

363
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:33,600
know this is a hard one this might be

364
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,120
the hardest one of them all because this

365
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,839
might not have even if you were

366
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,940
um scrutinizing activity on the at the

367
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,260
time this happened this might not have

368
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,800
looked very different from that user's

369
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,600
you know ordinary work Behavior day to

370
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,680
day

371
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,380
um the exfiltration of course if you had

372
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,680
been able to see the exfiltration that's

373
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,019
that's a possibility but apart from that

374
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,519
so

375
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,160
um in 2021 we had this case where

376
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,260
according to the indictment we had an

377
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,300
actual case of Insider threat the first

378
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,519
the first big Insider threat case that

379
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,320
I'm aware of so far at least

380
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,180
um in in the cloud environments where

381
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,700
according to indictment a user with some

382
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,860
privilege privilege went rogue

383
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,680
and started to exfolt data and

384
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,360
apparently tried to engage in some kind

385
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,579
of an extortion scheme or some kind of a

386
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,820
monetary demand in exchange for the data

387
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,440
um eventually

388
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,820
um of course eventually law enforcement

389
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,620
were able to uh to identify them and get

390
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,260
attribution and went to prosecution

391
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,399
um

392
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,019
one of the things I've noticed about

393
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,940
these these indictments and the reason I

394
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,860
put them in here is that many of these

395
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,200
indictments have a kind of a breadcrumb

396
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,019
trail to anomaly detections are kinds of

397
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,300
anomaly detections and potential anomal

398
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,880
detection recipes that we can use like

399
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,500
in this case

400
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,180
they mentioned in the indictment they

401
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,519
mentioned that this user was ran a

402
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,200
command called get caller identity in

403
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,680
the course of so the user logged out log

404
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,779
came back in from a VPN in order to try

405
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,639
to hide their Identity or obfuscate

406
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,100
their identity and then ran get caller

407
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,600
identity and get caller identity is

408
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,240
basically like a who am I command and

409
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,639
um it's it's very unremarkable

410
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,760
to see a user or or a program running

411
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,380
that command it's pretty uh it's pretty

412
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,180
unremarkable for the most part so I'm

413
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,920
not surprised that this wasn't

414
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,720
you know if people were looking at the

415
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,579
logs on this day there wasn't really a

416
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:27,480
reason

417
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,800
um somebody would have found that

418
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,180
unusual

419
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,920
um there's one possibility though in

420
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,060
each of these so in each of these

421
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,519
examples there's one possibility

422
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,320
um something else that they mentioned

423
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,260
that might have been anomalous was

424
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,320
they changed retention policies on

425
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,660
certain um storage probably on an S3

426
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,360
bucket or a certain storage places where

427
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,720
logs were kept probably as a defensive

428
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,399
agent probably thinking that if they

429
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,800
change the retention to one day then

430
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,199
with only 24 hours of log data by the

431
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,699
time anybody got around to investigate

432
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,800
there might simply not be any log data

433
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,620
to to investigate

434
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,040
um in 2019 we had this case where and

435
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,019
this was this one was a bit more complex

436
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,899
where somebody was able to according to

437
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:14,279
what we know somebody was able to

438
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,860
actually kind of bounce through a WAFF

439
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,839
or web application firewall service and

440
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,459
get execution on their virtual instance

441
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,260
running the WAFF and then call the

442
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,060
metadata service the metadata service if

443
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,199
you're not familiar it's just an

444
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,940
informational service

445
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,079
um that exists in most Cloud

446
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,240
environments where a virtual machine or

447
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,760
a compute instance can call the metadata

448
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,600
service

449
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,220
um over HTTP and just ask questions

450
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,740
about itself and it can also ask

451
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,600
questions like what am I authorized to

452
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,720
do and if I'm authorized to do this or

453
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
that transaction or work in the servicer

454
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,500
that can I have credentials and

455
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,940
authorization to work in those services

456
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,860
and the metadata service say yes you can

457
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,779
and you know use these credentials use

458
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,240
these temporary access tokens

459
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,980
um long story short someone is able to

460
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,579
to obtain access tokens

461
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,019
um this way and we're able to use those

462
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,420
to start exfiltrating bulk data from the

463
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,500
storage service

464
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,959
and you notice that this was the one

465
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,639
this was the example that kind of

466
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,440
originally got me started thinking along

467
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,480
these lines because you notice in here

468
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
they even note and I they probably

469
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,720
weren't thinking about anomaly detection

470
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,060
here I I don't know if they were but you

471
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,160
know they actually they actually

472
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,720
um commented the fact that this this

473
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,060
waffle waffle would have been a it would

474
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,980
have been a role that was used by this

475
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,720
virtual machine instance in order to

476
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,480
deliver Waf related services

477
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,560
um in the notice that this waffle

478
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,240
doesn't ordinarily invoke the list

479
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,160
Buckets come in

480
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,600
um list buckets is if you're not

481
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,759
familiar it's basically like like an LS

482
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:41,399
it's like a version it's like an LS for

483
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,699
storage service it's like list available

484
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,940
um not directories but a bucket is not

485
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,040
exactly like a directory but a bucket is

486
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,259
a container where files and data blobs

487
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,779
can live so it's basically like show me

488
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:58,880
a listing of available storage units

489
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,860
um and then 2016 was the it was the

490
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,120
first one one of the more interesting

491
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,439
ones because

492
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,040
in this case they um according to the

493
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,720
indictment according what we read they

494
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,839
actually shared snapshots

495
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,839
from the victim account to the attacker

496
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,839
account and a snapshot is

497
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,059
um in in Cloud speak what a snapshot is

498
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,679
essentially a virtual disk image it's

499
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,179
virtually it's just an image of a

500
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,220
virtual disk it's normally attached to a

501
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,900
virtual machine but it can also exist in

502
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,940
a detached state in order to be attached

503
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,580
to some other virtual machine uh and it

504
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,020
but you know it will basically contain

505
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,720
the file system that whatever virtual

506
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,580
machine uses it expects to have which

507
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,280
may contain production data and of you

508
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,840
know any and all kinds

509
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,140
and so they use this sharing feature

510
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,900
um to sort of forklift data to their

511
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,160
account and presumably from their

512
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,200
account they exfiltrated to somewhere

513
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,539
else that was under their control

514
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,640
um but there's another case where let's

515
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,340
let's look at these so if we look at

516
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,679
these actions each one of these um in

517
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,840
Cloud speak when you call an API method

518
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,600
it's um in some classes called an action

519
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,039
but essentially you're calling an API

520
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,120
method

521
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,440
and so can we when it comes to the

522
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,760
question of how do we detect these

523
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,580
things well

524
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,520
many of these that we're looking at are

525
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,200
not really good candidates for simple

526
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,660
alerting or detection

527
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,640
um why because they're just super memory

528
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,260
so

529
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,660
um get caller identity is is sort of

530
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,299
like who am I and um

531
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,220
as you can imagine you know it would you

532
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,660
could have similar issues alerting on

533
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,039
that then you might have alerting on who

534
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,000
am I

535
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,620
um and it heavily automated environment

536
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,900
where that's used extensively but

537
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,000
um that can in in production

538
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,600
um

539
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,640
I'm looking at a cloud trail data here

540
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,679
which is what I've been focused on but

541
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,380
get color identity may exist there may

542
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,660
be hundreds of thousands of instances of

543
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,760
that action in the logs at any given

544
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,660
time

545
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,100
um list buckets is usually in the tens

546
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,559
of thousands and

547
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,780
shared snapshot volume created can range

548
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,240
it can be a few thousand but it can also

549
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,559
get up into the hundreds of thousands

550
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,399
anybody know why

551
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,440
that's something that is that has been

552
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,500
on the increase over over the last uh

553
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,600
while last few years uh the reason is

554
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,799
because

555
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:22,280
um snapshots are increasingly being used

556
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,500
by security products and services so for

557
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,240
so-called like agentless security

558
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,500
scanning

559
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,780
um so sometimes security tools will in

560
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,100
order to avoid having to install and

561
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,720
manage agents sometimes security tools

562
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,320
will scan this the snapshots instead

563
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,360
um and so

564
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,039
um snapshot access and snapshot

565
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,320
operations are are be kind of become

566
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,880
much more supernumerate than they used

567
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,460
to be say five seven years ago

568
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,100
um so then when it comes to user context

569
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,039
this is just a simple scatter plot to

570
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,360
give you an idea of what it looks like

571
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,980
but

572
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,039
um there are with and this is what a lot

573
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,020
of these look like in that there's a

574
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,400
there are a small number of user

575
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,640
contexts that call this action uh about

576
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,860
a huge number of times but then there's

577
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,020
a long long tail of user contexts that

578
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,539
call it occasionally

579
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:15,000
and um you know too many to think about

580
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,340
any kind of you know simple alerting

581
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,340
same thing with Source IP addresses

582
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,780
um there's a few Source IP addresses

583
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,480
that that call that action

584
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,700
um a large number of times and but

585
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,160
there's a long long tail of source IPS

586
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,799
that call it occasionally with a long

587
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,340
tail of normal outliers uh too many to

588
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,919
potentially too many for for to make

589
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,240
that a good candidate for anomaly

590
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,640
detection so list buckets

591
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,740
um is one of them is also a heavily used

592
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,320
command and it normally occurs thousands

593
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,940
of times a day it can occur millions of

594
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,039
times a day if if it's an environment

595
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,200
that makes heavy use of S3 as it's as

596
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,960
its primary data layer

597
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,299
um typically you'll see it if you in any

598
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,280
in any on any given day in any given

599
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,960
cloudtrail lock set you'll see at least

600
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,620
50 000 um you'll see you know up to 50

601
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,360
000 unique user contexts calling that

602
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,320
method

603
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,480
um over the course of not in a day but

604
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,100
over the course of most of the retention

605
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,360
windows that I'm dealing with are

606
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,700
between one and four weeks so in a

607
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,080
matter of weeks

608
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,880
so the problem is you know how would you

609
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,760
find on like on on that in that second

610
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,059
example when this one role associated

611
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,740
with a WAFF service that has no reason

612
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,600
to call this bucket starts calling it

613
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,820
the data was there but it might be one

614
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,880
user context amongst tens of thousands

615
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,880
so when it comes to detection

616
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,200
um

617
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,080
the snapshot sharing method actually has

618
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,500
a uh a tactic technique combination in

619
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,940
the attack Matrix and it's called

620
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,900
well there there are several related to

621
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,340
to snapshot

622
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,380
um sharing and modification

623
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,360
and I think the one we're looking for in

624
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,039
particular is the at the bottom is

625
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,080
called snapshot modification

626
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,360
but there's a tactic technique called

627
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,460
transfer data to Cloud account which

628
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,860
essentially involves using snapshots to

629
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,400
to exfiltrate data and so the guidance

630
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,200
here talks about

631
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,880
says you know periodically Baseline

632
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,380
snapshots to identify malicious

633
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,200
modifications or additions and so and

634
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,480
that's I think that's good advice

635
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,799
um the Practical problem is how to

636
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,299
implement that when we have tens of

637
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,860
thousands or maybe hundreds of thousands

638
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,440
of snapshot operations with a long tail

639
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,600
of normal outliers in most Dimensions

640
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,520
whether it's user context or Source IP

641
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,980
or something else

642
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,820
um

643
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,620
Source i p address we can pretty much

644
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,600
take that off the table as far as

645
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,620
looking for unusual Source IPS because

646
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,559
there for one in most Cloud environments

647
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,020
there are

648
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,860
there there's an incredibly large and

649
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,360
um unusually distributed number of

650
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,100
source IPS there's too many to even

651
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,780
start thinking about baselining or doing

652
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,520
anomaly detection

653
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,159
um there are normal outliers there are

654
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,620
new IPS that show up that you've never

655
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,940
seen before and they're used for a time

656
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,320
and they go away simply because Source

657
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,480
IPS are considered to be uh

658
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,460
they're they're not in there they don't

659
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,220
you can't consider them as an entity in

660
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,799
that you can't assume that there is a

661
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,720
user or a host or any kind of an entity

662
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,059
behind a source IP because things come

663
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,880
up and down and IPS are assigned and and

664
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,640
unassigned and so

665
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,799
um that's you know just that's not

666
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,720
really good fertile ground for for

667
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,700
conventional detection or for anomaly

668
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,960
detection

669
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,179
so

670
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,320
um

671
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,419
even though

672
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,059
we're looking at volumes like these

673
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:40,440
there are cases and there actually are

674
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,520
projects

675
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,860
where people have written alert rules

676
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,620
for they've written simple alert rules

677
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,900
for actions like these

678
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,000
um like assume rule assume rule is

679
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,679
basically almost like the equivalent of

680
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,380
a pseudo it's saying I wanted to assume

681
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,240
role I want to elevate or change my

682
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,179
privilege from from who I am now to this

683
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,220
other role why because this other rule

684
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,500
will allow me to do work in another

685
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,080
service or Elevate privileges to do

686
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,179
something I want to do again secret

687
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,860
values is pretty much what it sounds

688
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,620
like assume role with saml is is when

689
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,179
you have human users logging into the

690
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:16,980
console most of the time if they're

691
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,000
logged into the console they're

692
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
authenticating by a saml

693
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,400
um and you know there are fewer of those

694
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,159
than there are just plain old assume

695
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,299
role events but the reason being because

696
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,299
assume rule events are used more by

697
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:33,539
compute instances than by humans

698
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,860
um for the most part they're heavily

699
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,840
used by compute instances in order to

700
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,760
assume the Privileges that they need in

701
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,260
order to do work

702
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,179
and so you know with these kinds of

703
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,880
numbers it's it's it's you know way too

704
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,500
many of these to think about simple

705
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,820
alerting

706
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,640
but even if we wanted to start creating

707
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,740
complex logic to try to Baseline these

708
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,539
the amount of branching logic that we

709
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,159
would need to try to Define and

710
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,679
enumerate normal versus abnormal use of

711
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,440
some of these methods based on users or

712
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,240
sources or something else

713
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,580
um it's it's just too large to deal with

714
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,299
so the good news is that the

715
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,159
the threat model that we're dealing with

716
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,340
for the most part even though the

717
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,039
possible manifestations are are numerous

718
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,700
and the um if we draw in a tag tree like

719
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,220
I've tried to do here it's at least for

720
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,900
credentialed Access it's relatively

721
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,700
simple in that

722
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,159
most of the time we're really looking

723
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:30,720
for either

724
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,600
um a compromised compute instance so

725
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,919
somebody has persistence on a

726
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,480
compromised virtual machine or container

727
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,340
and then they're doing assume roles

728
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,860
calls from there in order to elevate

729
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,720
Privileges and gain access to data or

730
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,159
things or

731
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,440
um or pop or somebody has compromised

732
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,240
credentials and they're authenticating

733
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,340
using a key so they've they've obtained

734
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,200
either they've obtained a key from the

735
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,460
file system on a compute instance

736
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,380
possibly or they have obtained a working

737
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,020
set of credentials from somewhere else

738
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,539
um and so what I've what I've done is in

739
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:04,559
order to try to explain why I use some

740
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,480
of these anomaly detection methods I've

741
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,100
I've organized them here under these

742
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,659
these two different

743
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:11,340
um branches of this tree

744
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,340
so in the case of compromise credentials

745
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,580
what I found is

746
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,919
Geographic anomalies are are work pretty

747
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,360
well for this

748
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,860
um and that's not new so Geographic

749
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,840
anomalies are good at detecting a lot of

750
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,600
authenticated credentialed access

751
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,220
um and a lot of anomalous credentialed

752
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,960
access patterns

753
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,700
but they're also really useful here

754
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,260
because

755
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,380
um most of the time there aren't a lot

756
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,539
there isn't a lot of normal variance in

757
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,580
in Source geography for cloud activity

758
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,380
especially automated Cloud activity and

759
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,400
transactions

760
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,000
so

761
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,039
rare service for a user and rare Source

762
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,720
geography for an action or what they

763
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,059
sound like so rare service for user is

764
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:56,039
as a user working in a service that they

765
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,440
normally don't the reason is that most

766
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,080
users most of the time they work in the

767
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,659
same Services over and over again and

768
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,600
they do they generate very dense amounts

769
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,059
of transactions in the logs

770
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,039
um it's it's relatively unusual for a

771
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,760
user to to start using a new service

772
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,799
um and to generate a very sparse number

773
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,740
of transactions usually users in user

774
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,240
context usually they generate very Dent

775
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,820
activity or none at all

776
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,640
um a new action for user is

777
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,400
I'm using that instead of rare action

778
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,480
for a user and I'll I'll show you why

779
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,340
um spikes in errors and events are

780
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,740
useful and

781
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,120
in the next chart I've got another

782
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,860
diagram where I'm trying to try to

783
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,820
illustrate

784
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,360
um

785
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,460
what each of these like why are we using

786
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,600
which case

787
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,640
um each of these does better or worse at

788
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,440
finding particular particular parts of

789
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,880
the threat model tree

790
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,500
so

791
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,720
um on the compromise instance side there

792
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,880
are probably the odds are with a

793
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,020
compromised instance it's going to be

794
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,640
running you know there's not going to be

795
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,860
any kind of geographic anomaly there for

796
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,500
the most part but there there often will

797
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,360
be rare service activity there often

798
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,580
will be new transaction activity

799
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,740
um possibly new rules for a key what

800
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,480
that means is that there was a new

801
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,159
combination of

802
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,260
in an assumed role event there was a new

803
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,620
combination of key and roll name the

804
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,900
reason is that because most of the time

805
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,260
um because a a key can be assumed well

806
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,940
most of them we can assume that a key

807
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,860
has an entity behind it it's either a

808
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,400
user or a compute instance and where you

809
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,600
know whether it's your user compute

810
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,659
instance they tend to use the same roles

811
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,120
and do the same work over and over again

812
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,059
so when they when they um when you see a

813
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,760
new combination of user context and key

814
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,059
or a new combination of key and user

815
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,919
context or role that's often interesting

816
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,860
that can be an indicator of of

817
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,900
possibly privilege elevation or lateral

818
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,460
movement if it's a case of credentialed

819
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,900
access

820
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,960
so

821
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,059
this is

822
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,580
this is kind of like my attempt to

823
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,200
diagram

824
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,240
what each of these

825
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,000
um anomaly detection methods are are

826
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,679
good at finding

827
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,140
so

828
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,460
on the

829
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,580
on the horizontal axis so the horizontal

830
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,700
axis is the duration in time it's has

831
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,620
the intrusion did the intrusion just

832
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,899
start five minutes ago or has it been

833
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,000
going on for a day or has it been going

834
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,220
on for a week or has it been you know

835
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,380
longer than that so it's it's you know

836
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,960
is it is it a short or long duration and

837
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,179
the horizontal axis is the density of

838
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,880
the events is the intrusion set or the

839
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,740
is the intrusion or the threat act

840
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,140
you're creating uh many events and doing

841
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,760
many transactions and creating many

842
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,059
events or or is the density small

843
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:54,960
and so this is the reason why I find I

844
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,419
need the combination of

845
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,279
um different functions the three main

846
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,679
functions I'm doing are are new

847
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,000
um things that are new or combinations

848
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,340
that are new in um and that they have

849
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,559
not manifested before things that are um

850
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,539
statistically rare that they are the

851
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:10,980
least frequently occurring combinations

852
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,960
in certain combination sets

853
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,620
and then the spike function looks for

854
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,020
um they look for

855
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,720
rates of events or errors that are

856
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,360
unusually high say like if you take the

857
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,240
the five largest spikes in an error or

858
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,700
an event by standard deviation

859
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,580
and if you take the top five from the

860
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,260
entire set you'll often find that the

861
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,440
top five to ten are outliers in that

862
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,640
they are

863
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,460
well beyond any kind of normal Peaks and

864
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,860
troughs you see from day to day and so a

865
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,740
spike in error like that can mean it

866
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,880
doesn't necessarily mean that there is

867
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,559
an intrusion a spike in errors can also

868
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,480
mean that something is just broken or

869
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,980
something possibly something third party

870
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,740
is trying to do uh trying to elevate

871
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,600
privileges that it doesn't have and

872
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,580
something is just misconfigured but

873
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,200
there's the interesting thing about rare

874
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,520
or the interesting thing about a spike

875
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,320
in errors is that there's there's not

876
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,059
really a benign explanation for a spike

877
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,100
in errors either something is broken or

878
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,860
there's something suspicious going on

879
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,039
um so in the case of something that is

880
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,960
relatively new so it just started

881
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,520
recently

882
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,260
um

883
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,500
new functions say like a new action for

884
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,140
a user or a new combination of of um key

885
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,899
and role will often be good at finding

886
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,580
that

887
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,120
um but if the intrusion is is extant

888
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,399
it's been going on for some time maybe

889
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:38,100
some days or weeks then

890
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,779
most of the time a new function won't

891
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:42,360
necessarily find that so in that case a

892
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,559
rare function looking at rare

893
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,240
combinations is better at finding that

894
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,100
assuming that

895
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,380
um what they're doing is assuming that

896
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,820
there are aspects of what they're doing

897
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,500
that create kind of sparse events or

898
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,480
sparse combinations

899
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,640
um Geographic anomaly detection is is

900
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,799
good um generally

901
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,960
um of course there's a there's you know

902
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,760
but it's not a Panacea but of course you

903
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,080
know there's a simple Evasion for

904
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,640
Geographic and Nomine detection which

905
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,799
simply is don't be in a different

906
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,779
geography than your victim now make sure

907
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,220
you're in the same geography that the

908
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,360
victim is in

909
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,559
um in which case we have to start

910
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:14,820
thinking about things like autonomous

911
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,500
system Network names

912
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,059
which is something I want to do next

913
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:19,260
because

914
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,580
um even if you're in the same geography

915
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,620
as you're a victim the odds are your

916
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,419
um your as name and number is probably

917
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:26,100
different

918
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,779
um and then spike in errors and events

919
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,700
like I said a spike in errors is a good

920
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,620
way of finding if somebody lands on a

921
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,299
compromise instance and starts doing

922
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,700
large-scale enumeration in order to do

923
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,380
privilege elevation or lateral movement

924
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,299
or just starts doing Discovery it's

925
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,279
often the case that they'll create a a

926
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,740
huge spike in errors that's well beyond

927
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,419
uh it may have a could have a standard

928
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,399
deviation and into the tens of thousands

929
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,140
it's well beyond anything you've seen

930
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,460
before

931
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,919
um unless they land on an instance that

932
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,260
has say god-like access this

933
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,539
unrestricted admin access which case

934
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,039
they may not generate any authorization

935
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,020
errors but they may well still generate

936
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,360
an unusually large spike in certain

937
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,480
events especially Discovery events

938
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,539
so in the examples

939
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:10,919
um the practical application for this

940
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,140
and examples is

941
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,419
um in the first case

942
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,399
um

943
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,640
the the get caller identity transaction

944
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,980
would was coming in from some kind of a

945
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,840
VPN service that likely was in a source

946
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,080
geography that was unusual possibly new

947
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,500
not seen before but probably rare

948
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,980
um and but even if not if it was say if

949
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,539
the geography was unremarkable then

950
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,419
there's still a case for an rare or new

951
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,100
autonomous system network name

952
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,399
um in the case of where the life cycle

953
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,580
retention policies were modified

954
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,899
um this would be a job for something

955
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,760
like a rare Source country for an action

956
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,100
rare service for a user

957
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,960
um the odds are that most human users

958
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,940
most of the time most human users don't

959
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,980
go around setting life cycle retention

960
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,419
policies to one day especially for

961
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,280
logging logging is usually set up and

962
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,440
torn down by automation so this might

963
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,179
have been a rare service for user it

964
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,440
might have been a new action for a user

965
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,119
um in this case this was coming in from

966
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,800
and some of this from what I read was

967
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,839
coming in from a VPN some of it was

968
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,820
coming in via tour so there would have

969
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,040
been a rare Source geography for these

970
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,260
actions there would have been a rare

971
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,699
service for the user as this user

972
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,159
context started calling S3 for the first

973
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,399
time and if if we were running at the at

974
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:36,899
the moment this happened it would have

975
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:39,599
been a new action for the user and that

976
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,139
um

977
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,820
we would have seen this user context

978
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,619
called list buckets for the same for the

979
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:44,879
first time

980
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,000
and then the snapshot activity

981
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,339
um we don't actually know enough about

982
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,320
this to know if there was a rare Source

983
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,820
geography here but I suspect there

984
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,440
likely was

985
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,300
um and if not there's likely a rare

986
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,099
Source network but there would have been

987
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,900
a rare service for the user and a new

988
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,060
action for a user because from what I've

989
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,099
read about this from what I understand

990
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:06,780
the the user context in question here

991
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:09,359
was it was more of a business user not

992
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,099
an engineer and not somebody that you

993
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,780
would ordinarily see sharing snapshots

994
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,540
so it would have been very anomalous so

995
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,800
the reason

996
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,020
um the reason I'm doing

997
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,660
well the reason I'm not doing say

998
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,320
um rare action or method for a user is

999
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,280
because there are too many normal

1000
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,599
outliers

1001
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,220
um it looks like this

1002
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,980
um because and I've tried this I've

1003
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,119
tried

1004
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,880
um running combinations of

1005
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,820
rare say rare action action meaning

1006
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,859
method basically rare transaction for a

1007
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:44,640
user in cloudtrail data and it will find

1008
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,560
suspicious activity and threat activity

1009
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,320
but it will also find normal outliers

1010
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,000
that are just not remarkable so the

1011
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,460
signal to noise there it's it's good but

1012
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,980
it's not great

1013
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,839
um like in this case if if I were to run

1014
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:58,859
this

1015
00:35:58,859 --> 00:35:59,460
um

1016
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,260
what I'm doing at the moment I'm

1017
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,180
actually doing anomaly detection in SQL

1018
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,320
at the moment because I have my

1019
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,180
collateral data is in a SQL data in a

1020
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,460
series of SQL tables and it turns out

1021
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,320
you can do there's some math functions

1022
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,540
you can do in SQL so

1023
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,160
um

1024
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,920
when we tried running rare action for a

1025
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,060
user

1026
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,940
on a medium-sized cluster with say 300

1027
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,160
million ish events

1028
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,740
um there are

1029
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,940
200 to 250 results typically and

1030
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,520
some of those are interesting enough to

1031
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,339
investigate but many of them are not so

1032
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:36,720
the signal to noise is just not good

1033
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,099
enough to think about turning that into

1034
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,780
an alert or turning that into a

1035
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,240
something that goes into a unit of work

1036
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,460
um but if we run new action for user

1037
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,020
instead then we have to find that is

1038
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,720
what I mean is that

1039
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,180
um looking for

1040
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,700
in the set of transactions that have

1041
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,380
been called by user

1042
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,140
looking for instances in the last one to

1043
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,119
two days where I have a combination of

1044
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,000
user and action that has not manifested

1045
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,540
in the prior say 30 days

1046
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,060
um using a query and so using a query

1047
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,400
I'm limited to going back to however

1048
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,560
much Hot Table exists in the data are

1049
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,540
exists in the table sorry

1050
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,400
um in the future I plan to turn this

1051
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,079
into

1052
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,180
um an airflow pipeline so that it will

1053
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,920
have some memory so that it will be able

1054
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,980
to reason about new combinations that it

1055
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,740
has seen uh like new combinations in the

1056
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,060
last day or two

1057
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,740
um that have never been seen before for

1058
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,780
as long as the function is running even

1059
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,520
though we only maybe have one or three

1060
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,560
days of hot data it still remembers what

1061
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,180
it has seen you know basically for all

1062
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,240
time so a simple learning function

1063
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,940
um so the first time I turned this on

1064
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,099
what I found is this and it was not what

1065
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:48,480
I was expecting

1066
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,079
so this is the output of one of the

1067
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,240
queries called rare Source country for

1068
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,619
an action and it's essentially looking

1069
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:58,140
for the least frequently occurring

1070
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,260
instance combinations of event name or

1071
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,540
action basically the transaction name

1072
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,880
and the source geography because in this

1073
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,180
case I'm I'm enriching these events with

1074
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,280
with Geographic data which is something

1075
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,260
I don't think that happens automatically

1076
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,900
in most Cloud environments but um but

1077
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,160
it's something you can do they're using

1078
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,079
there there are there's Geographic data

1079
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,760
available for providers like Max mine

1080
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,320
that you can use to do this

1081
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,420
so does anyone notice anything

1082
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:28,200
right off the bat

1083
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,880
um in the first row

1084
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,180
there are two assumed role events from a

1085
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,380
source country

1086
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,839
and then there's another describe

1087
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:38,940
instances event describe instances event

1088
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,220
is what it sounds like describe it if

1089
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,839
you call describe instances with no

1090
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:44,880
arguments and then it'll basically just

1091
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,980
return say here's everything we know

1092
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,619
about all of the instances the compute

1093
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,760
instances running in this account

1094
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,680
basically just tell me everything about

1095
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,720
the compute instances

1096
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,660
um it's very unusual to see

1097
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,119
it's very unusual to see a user call

1098
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,040
assume roll twice

1099
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,599
um or it's very unusual to see a zoom

1100
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,240
role happen twice in any Dimension

1101
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,040
whether it's user Network Source i p

1102
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,200
Source country or anything else and same

1103
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,540
for describe instances so it turned out

1104
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,820
it didn't take long to find out that

1105
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,180
this was a source country that did not

1106
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,980
have any business relationship and so

1107
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,320
this this activity was

1108
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,660
um was inexplicable at first

1109
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,700
yeah

1110
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,200
um

1111
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,060
there were also a couple of start and

1112
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,099
stop instances events which were a

1113
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,680
little troubling because

1114
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,839
um what those do is a start instance

1115
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,839
will start a virtual machine a stop

1116
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,760
instance will stop a virtual machine the

1117
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,140
reason it's troubling to see that in

1118
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,579
combination is sometimes you'll see that

1119
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:46,020
combination if a virtual machine has

1120
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,619
been modified in order to um because if

1121
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,660
if you don't have say if you're a threat

1122
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,099
actor and if you don't have working

1123
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,420
credentials

1124
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,200
um to persist into a cloud API but if

1125
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,240
you do have the ability to modify a

1126
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,640
virtual machine sometimes people will

1127
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,800
will choose to persist in a virtual

1128
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,720
machine instead and then and then

1129
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,119
attempt to elevate privileges by means

1130
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,740
of whatever assume role operations the

1131
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,599
virtual machine can do

1132
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:16,740
um but to see you know again to see one

1133
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,599
instance of these two transactions from

1134
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,400
any Dimension whether it's user country

1135
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,560
or Source IP or anything else it's very

1136
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,480
unusual and most of the time

1137
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,700
um most of the time most user contexts

1138
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,560
are are doing very dense very large

1139
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,359
numbers of start and stop instance

1140
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,460
operations it's very unusual to see

1141
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,800
anything or anyone just just do one of

1142
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,980
each

1143
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,359
um

1144
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,460
and then this was new action for a user

1145
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,960
so

1146
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,460
it turned out that the describe

1147
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,240
instances transaction was also something

1148
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,920
that this user context had never called

1149
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,020
before

1150
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,680
um

1151
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,020
and so this has been a little bit some

1152
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,760
of this has been grayed out but what I

1153
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,839
found is

1154
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,920
it was actually a third-party account

1155
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,780
that's being used that was being used to

1156
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,760
deliver Services

1157
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,400
um in the in the environment so the the

1158
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,500
presence of this third-party account was

1159
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,500
normal but the transactions that it was

1160
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,900
were doing were not and could not be

1161
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,839
reconciled so

1162
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,940
um this was investigated and in the end

1163
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,520
it was decided to completely remove this

1164
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,640
access

1165
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,280
um in terms of hunting for this

1166
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,480
um I tried to include some more helpful

1167
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,339
information

1168
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,140
in terms of

1169
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,260
considering whether or not there may be

1170
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,599
unauthorized third-party activity going

1171
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,520
on in a cloud account

1172
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,180
um

1173
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,119
one of the good places to look is is

1174
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,160
um if you had say if you have a spike in

1175
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,359
errors if you have a spike in

1176
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,480
authorization errors related to this

1177
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,920
um then they'll often give you some

1178
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,140
clues about well they'll definitely tell

1179
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,540
you that the user context that's behind

1180
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,060
it and then that's one way to if you

1181
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,859
sort these out by user context it's one

1182
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:06,660
way to kind of quickly determine whether

1183
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,800
or not

1184
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,900
um you you have suspicious activity

1185
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,579
coming in from from any kind of

1186
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,060
third-party delegation accounts

1187
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,520
um and then in terms of the question of

1188
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,980
when you're looking at a data like this

1189
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,480
and you're asking

1190
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,640
well what is this third-party account

1191
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,859
actually supposed to do

1192
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:27,000
um one of the things you can do is if

1193
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,140
you can go back to find the original

1194
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,060
create policy events from when the

1195
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,460
access was first instantiated the create

1196
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,800
policy events will usually usually when

1197
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,359
the when the vendor is setting up their

1198
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:37,500
access

1199
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,940
um they'll do a create policy operation

1200
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,099
and that create policy operation will

1201
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:43,140
usually will tell you what it is they

1202
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,900
expect to do so that's one good kind of

1203
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,640
clue is that if you find a user if you

1204
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,140
find a third party account getting

1205
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,240
running into errors or trying to do

1206
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,619
something that

1207
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,780
um that you can't reconcile and if it's

1208
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,820
not something that is specified in the

1209
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,980
original crate policy then chances are

1210
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,260
that it's well it could be that

1211
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,319
something has changed on their side uh

1212
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,420
and they and they haven't thought to ask

1213
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,119
for increased permissions or access or

1214
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,440
it could be that something strange is

1215
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,700
going on

1216
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,040
and in terms of do I have any

1217
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,200
third-party access at all it's actually

1218
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,420
not that easy and straightforward to

1219
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,880
kind of audit for this but one of the

1220
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,560
things you can look for is depending on

1221
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,900
how about how far back your data goes is

1222
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,460
if you do sometimes you'll find this

1223
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,020
event called create open ID connect

1224
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,300
provider and this is just a sample

1225
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,760
request and response and if you have

1226
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,040
third-party access you'll often find or

1227
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,540
if you're if you're about to have third

1228
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,220
party access you'll often find that this

1229
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,500
is one of the events associated with

1230
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,579
with setting that up

1231
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,200
um a couple other examples

1232
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,020
this is uh this is actually there's

1233
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,180
actually two things going on here so the

1234
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,819
first line item is is is paku and that's

1235
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:55,680
actually authorized security audit

1236
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,660
activity somebody's running a pacu is

1237
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,980
essentially like a security testing

1238
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,900
framework auditing tool it can also be

1239
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,760
used for pen testing

1240
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,520
um but the third line item is not normal

1241
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,440
and what it's finding there is what is

1242
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,660
outputting there is that that user

1243
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,099
account

1244
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:12,720
um authenticated from two different

1245
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,359
countries at the same time

1246
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,000
um so and at the same time period they

1247
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,200
were authenticated from two different

1248
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,480
countries and one of the countries is is

1249
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,800
one that simply doesn't make sense

1250
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,240
because there isn't any kind of business

1251
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,899
relationship

1252
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,920
um

1253
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,560
planning on using so as as far as

1254
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,839
expanding this I'm thinking about

1255
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,780
um new country for user and possibly new

1256
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,460
source IP for an account and the reason

1257
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,560
being is that again

1258
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,760
if

1259
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,520
if an intrusion has been going on for

1260
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,220
more than a short time

1261
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,000
um

1262
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,940
then sometimes you know it'll be

1263
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,740
sometimes it'll be easier to find this

1264
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,960
sometimes it won't but

1265
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,060
um if you if

1266
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,619
you're in a situation where you have

1267
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:00,480
these functions running continuously

1268
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,460
like in this scenario I described where

1269
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:04,380
the new functions have been have been

1270
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,619
running for a long time and they're able

1271
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:09,000
to remember

1272
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,560
um basically they're able to remember a

1273
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,900
long-term Baseline then

1274
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,359
we potentially could pick up a

1275
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,280
geographic anomaly potentially pick up a

1276
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,780
credentialed access instance coming in

1277
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,060
from an anomalous country uh right away

1278
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,700
like in the first few minutes versus

1279
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,500
having to having to wait for a

1280
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,020
geographic anomaly to form

1281
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,640
um new source IP for an account what

1282
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,380
that's about is

1283
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,980
if um if you interrogate your Cloud

1284
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,980
inventory data and keep track of all the

1285
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,420
IP addresses that are in use in your

1286
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,099
account there's a lot of really useful

1287
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:42,599
things we can do with those to reason

1288
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:44,880
about like one is that

1289
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,619
um if we see authenticated activity

1290
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,500
coming in from a cloud provider IP

1291
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,319
address and it's not in use by one of

1292
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,640
your accounts or by one of your

1293
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,020
instances

1294
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,460
um and it means it's from somebody

1295
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,800
else's account so either it's an account

1296
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,359
we don't know about or it's something

1297
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,220
strange going on

1298
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,800
um plan on doing similar things for with

1299
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,540
with endpoint data one thing I find

1300
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,060
useful is if you have Network events

1301
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,180
from from virtual machine endpoints you

1302
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,520
can correlate those with the network

1303
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,520
inventory in order to look for like in

1304
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,140
order to look for sort of North South

1305
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,560
traffic where virtual machine instances

1306
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,599
are doing heavy network activity

1307
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,020
um outside of your AWS account now it's

1308
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,060
not always that abnormal for them to be

1309
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,619
going outside of your AWS account

1310
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,000
because odds are they're going out to

1311
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,160
the internet to do lots of work

1312
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,380
um but if they're going to say an AWS or

1313
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,660
an as your IP address that's not one of

1314
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,920
yours

1315
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,980
um and the and the activity is dense and

1316
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,440
it's authenticated maybe or if it's

1317
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,819
um if it's something that you can't

1318
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:49,560
reconcile an endpoint like if it's a

1319
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,960
netcat instance or maybe SCP or

1320
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,040
something else that doesn't make sense

1321
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,619
and it's it's doing heavy activity to

1322
00:46:55,619 --> 00:46:58,800
another Cloud account then it's hard to

1323
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,240
you know it's hard to think of a benign

1324
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,619
explanation for that so that's a good

1325
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,920
detection

1326
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,099
um

1327
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:06,900
this was an example it's a new action

1328
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,460
for user this is the best thing it's

1329
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,099
done so far was back in January there

1330
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:13,260
was some research that was published uh

1331
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,260
not by me but it accredited it here

1332
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,700
where

1333
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,140
essentially what they found is that

1334
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,819
there's this obscure method called get

1335
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:22,680
Federation token that was being used for

1336
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,599
persistence and it was interesting

1337
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:25,980
because

1338
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,520
you could use this method to persist

1339
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,140
um not everywhere but you could use this

1340
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,880
method to persist at least in the

1341
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,579
console UI but it would but even after

1342
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:37,680
the original user account was disabled

1343
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,020
you could still persist this way and so

1344
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,339
people were from what I understand

1345
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:43,079
people were using this method to try to

1346
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:45,420
survive an eviction and maximize dwell

1347
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,300
time and try to persist even after

1348
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,800
people were attempting to evict them and

1349
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,020
and disable the original account and

1350
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,260
kick them out they were still so

1351
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,240
um this was output back in

1352
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,599
like late January early February

1353
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:02,339
and

1354
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:04,680
I like this example because

1355
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,540
back in January

1356
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,200
um

1357
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,180
you know back in December January this

1358
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,800
was something that we didn't even really

1359
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,599
know we needed to look for which is

1360
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:14,280
often the case

1361
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,099
um the cloud threat actors are still in

1362
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,560
a period of Rapid Evolution and there's

1363
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,300
new research coming out and there are

1364
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,400
new tactics and techniques appearing now

1365
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,560
and then that sometimes there are things

1366
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,020
that we you know we didn't necessarily

1367
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,839
know we needed to detect so I like

1368
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:32,220
anomaly detection there for that reason

1369
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,660
because sometimes it's sometimes it's

1370
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,819
good at finding emerging threats

1371
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:36,960
um even when we don't know what we're

1372
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,520
looking for you know we know we need to

1373
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,859
be looking for what's next but we don't

1374
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:42,119
know what it looks like so we can't

1375
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,040
write a rule or a search for it but

1376
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,240
sometimes we can still find it with

1377
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,520
anomaly detection

1378
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,040
so that is my talk and

1379
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,220
we have one minute left I think

1380
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,480
um

1381
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,339
so it can take maybe one question but

1382
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:02,480
I'm happy to hang out for questions

1383
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,060
no questions

1384
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,440
question one question

1385
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,680
okay yeah so the question is what about

1386
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,200
time of day so I think it will be useful

1387
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,000
uh I think what I need to do there

1388
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,339
though is I need to type the users

1389
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:30,359
um because

1390
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:30,960
um

1391
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,819
program there's a lot of programmatic

1392
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:35,280
users running Automation and tooling and

1393
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,619
doing work in Cloud environments and the

1394
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,180
programmatic users

1395
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,680
um they don't have seasons you know

1396
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,819
they're not nocturnal they're not

1397
00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:43,740
diurnal they're just they're just doing

1398
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,140
work all the time but for the human

1399
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,720
users if I can type the human users uh I

1400
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,339
think looking for anomalous time

1401
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:53,720
patterns for them could be useful yes

1402
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,839
and I am at time

1403
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:58,970
thanks

1404
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:02,189
[Applause]
