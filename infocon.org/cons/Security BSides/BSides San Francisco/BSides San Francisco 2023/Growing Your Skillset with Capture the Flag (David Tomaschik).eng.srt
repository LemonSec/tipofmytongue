1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,060
oh welcome David so David is a senior

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,440
security engineer on the Google

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,200
Offensive security team and has been

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,200
helping us to organize the b-sides CTF

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,420
for seven years now

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,820
he focuses on red teaming embedded

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,920
device security web security and

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,320
security education and today he will be

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,000
telling us how to grow our skill set

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,100
with ctfs we welcome David

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,100
thanks

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,939
so hopefully everyone is here for

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,380
growing your skill set with capture the

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,360
flag uh or at least you'll find it

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,739
interesting if you just wandered your

16
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,579
way in uh here uh quick obligatory

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,620
disclaimer I'm only presenting on uh

18
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,719
behalf of my own views and they're not

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,059
necessarily the views of my employer's

20
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,440
past present or future

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,820
um I've been playing CTF for at least a

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,700
decade now probably even longer uh I

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,500
wouldn't even begin to count how many um

24
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,420
I've played and I'm currently on the

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,160
staff for two different ctfs the one

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,920
here besides San Francisco so come check

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,860
us out in the CTF area but also the pros

28
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,340
versus Joe CTF at b-sides Las Vegas

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,340
um every summer

30
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,900
and which means I get to switch tracks

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,640
basically next week and start working on

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,140
that

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,119
um to get paid I have a secure senior

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,799
security engineer at Google I'm at one

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,299
of the tech leads on our red team there

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,240
I also occasionally blog or post random

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,880
thoughts to mastodon

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,040
uh so I want to go a little bit into the

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,080
different styles of ctfs and how you go

40
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,460
about playing ctfs if you've never

41
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,080
gotten into it but then I want to

42
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,240
actually talk about how it can apply to

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,060
your role as a security practitioner

44
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,040
like what is the skill sets that you

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,860
have in common between a CTF and being a

46
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,079
security practitioner and how can both

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,740
players and organizers work to improve

48
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,899
that and use it as an educational tool

49
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,680
in addition to a fun game

50
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,299
quick primer about ctfs if you've never

51
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,100
looked at one before there's generally

52
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,460
speaking two big styles of CTF one of

53
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,200
them is referred to as Jeopardy style

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,119
which is a panel of problems to be

55
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,079
solved

56
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,818
generally speaking you can solve them in

57
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,500
any order you want you can pick and

58
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
choose which ones you want to play and

59
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,480
I'd say the vast majority of ctfs fit

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,980
into this category including the one

61
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,200
we're hosting uh here this weekend so

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,980
there's

63
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,379
a wide range of challenges and you can

64
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,540
pick the things that you want to take a

65
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,400
crack at

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
the other end of the spectrum there's

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,819
what's called attack defense ctfs these

68
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,220
are live networks typically with a

69
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,860
number of services running on them often

70
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,379
you have to exploit other teams Services

71
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,080
while Defending Your Own from their

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,300
exploits so you might have to do binary

73
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,000
hot patching you might have to add

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,040
Network ACLS depends on the seat

75
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,720
particular CTF

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,940
and then there's some miscellaneous CTF

77
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,019
styles

78
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,019
there's some that are run uh

79
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,300
defense only so the Collegiate cyber

80
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,519
defense competition is like this

81
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,739
college students are trying to defend

82
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:03,900
networks and there's actually a team of

83
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,459
professional red teamers that are trying

84
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:07,379
to break into that Network to simulate

85
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,500
the adversary for them uh but only the

86
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,440
blue team side of that is sort of scored

87
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,519
or evaluated

88
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,840
there's also kind of a spectrum of

89
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,659
styles within the challenges uh ranging

90
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,680
from realistic to contrived

91
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,540
and you know on one end you might have

92
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,239
uh running known vulnerable services

93
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,420
with public cves

94
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,180
uh services that are misconfigured but

95
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,159
are real world business services at the

96
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,560
other end uh of the spectrum you might

97
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,140
get fictional architectures Defcon CTF a

98
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,940
few years ago ran an architecture that

99
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,000
was middle Indian which no such

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,680
architecture exists in the real world

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,940
but they wanted to make players

102
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,560
understand a new architecture so they

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
went there

104
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,739
uh ours is kind of in the middle at

105
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:57,959
B-side San Francisco we try to make the

106
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,580
security vulnerabilities in it very

107
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,319
realistic very based on things we've

108
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,940
seen in the real world but we

109
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,340
encapsulate them in a nice fake service

110
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,200
so that

111
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,280
um we know that the challenge is

112
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,799
solvable and so that it's uh you know

113
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,459
not a 200 uh page Java application for

114
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,060
you to go through

115
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,839
there's also something called War Games

116
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,519
some of you may have heard of War games

117
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,560
are very similar to ctfs but they're

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,199
generally not time-bound very often not

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,380
scored there are a lot of these online

120
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,460
sites where you can do war games and

121
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,080
it's again a set of challenges to be

122
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,940
solved uh but not in that same

123
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,220
competitive time-based manner that a CTF

124
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,479
typically is

125
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,000
a nice advantage of that is that you

126
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,560
don't have a lot of time commitment but

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,199
the flip side to it is I personally get

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,759
a lot of satisfaction out of seeing my

129
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,960
name on a scoreboard so

130
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,460
uh so here we go out of our way to make

131
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,800
an approachable and educational uh CTF

132
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,660
so we want to

133
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,759
think about what people will learn from

134
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,560
playing this ETF we want people to be

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,900
able to drop in during you know one talk

136
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,120
slot that nothing looks interesting on

137
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,620
the schedule you can drop in for an hour

138
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,320
and try a challenge and we try to draw

139
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,240
inspiration from Real World issues all

140
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,639
of us are security practitioners and we

141
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,199
look at the things we've seen recently

142
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,960
in our jobs and try to use that but we

143
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,400
also try to figure out what is someone

144
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,259
taking away by looking at this Challenge

145
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,540
and so that's really important to us as

146
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,600
challenge authors is that there's

147
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,639
something whether it's exposure to a new

148
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,139
technology or exposure to a new

149
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,900
vulnerability class or Hands-On uh

150
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,660
practice with a particular tool

151
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,940
um that someone can learn by doing these

152
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,360
challenges

153
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
um we do a wide variety of categories

154
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
but most of our challenges are web

155
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,720
security or crypto some exploitation uh

156
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,100
and a couple of Android and reverse

157
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,660
engineering challenges but fewer of

158
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,500
those

159
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,240
uh and if you want to come give it a try

160
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,100
we're in the CTF room or there's the the

161
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,979
URL for it

162
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,840
so I want to take this time now to talk

163
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,580
about what is the educational value

164
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,259
right the the premise of this is that

165
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,759
you can grow your skill set with capture

166
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,400
the flag and I want to talk about how

167
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,820
that works so the first question I get a

168
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,680
lot is like ctfs are a fun game but can

169
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,400
you actually learn anything uh from them

170
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
um and my answer is yes but I'm guessing

171
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,199
that in a talk you're expecting more

172
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,699
than a one-word answer to the question

173
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,300
so I'll go a little bit more into it

174
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,800
so the question is what can you actually

175
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,300
learn from it right there's technical

176
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,000
skills to be sure uh maybe you've never

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,680
done reverse engineering this can be

178
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,180
your first opportunity to reverse

179
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,800
engineer something instead of trying to

180
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,500
find some live malware or some game that

181
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,360
you want to reverse engineer as many of

182
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
us started with or you can try

183
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,080
exploiting a service and you know that

184
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,759
the service is actually exploitable

185
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,580
versus maybe a vulnerability that you

186
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,440
found in another application and maybe

187
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,600
is or isn't exploitable

188
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,460
or you can look at forensics and have a

189
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,380
well-defined path to the solution

190
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,240
you can even practice just your basic

191
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,979
scripting skills if that's what you feel

192
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,440
like you need to be able to grow

193
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
but the one thing I think ctfs really

194
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,100
excel at is helping you learn to think

195
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,199
outside of the box and I know that's

196
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,300
like the most cliche thing about

197
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,220
education ever is thinking outside of

198
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,680
the box but really there are a lot of

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,419
different things presented that you

200
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,400
probably haven't seen in your day-to-day

201
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,800
and you can see these and start to think

202
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,360
about the problems in a slightly

203
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,880
different way

204
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,740
so the skills that the depressioner will

205
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,539
use right it depends on your exact role

206
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,819
we all know that there's no one security

207
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,680
role there's a whole bunch of different

208
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,660
ones of us I work in offensive security

209
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,520
there's people on our team that do

210
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,120
digital forensics security researchers

211
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,099
um but some of the general skills that

212
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,780
you find as a security practitioner

213
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,520
include reverse engineering or

214
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,259
exploitation forensics threat modeling

215
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,880
triaging of vulnerabilities and even

216
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,720
writing programs uh and programming and

217
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,539
so not all of these translate one to one

218
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,940
but I think that there are some

219
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,919
and beyond that there's the less

220
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,139
technical side of the of skills like an

221
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,599
attacker mindset thinking how is an

222
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,400
attacker attacking a network how is an

223
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,440
attacker attacking an application

224
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,840
uh communication skills a lot of the

225
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,400
time when people ask what they should

226
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,440
learn next in the security space when

227
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,699
they tell me they've learned a bunch of

228
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,800
technical things like well how are your

229
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,360
communication skills because at the end

230
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,940
of the day almost everyone in security

231
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,020
spends their time communicating with

232
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,060
people outside the security field even

233
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,500
if they're technical

234
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,940
they have no idea what cross-site

235
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,680
scripting is most of the time and I have

236
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,479
to explain this in a way that an

237
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,099
engineer can understand the impact of

238
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,719
their bugs

239
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,760
and finally teamwork is also an aspect

240
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,500
of a lot of ctfs and a lot of

241
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,360
practitioner skills so you can look at

242
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,180
how you do collaboration how you split

243
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,980
effort how you divide up a technical

244
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,700
project among several individuals

245
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,720
so I will say it's not one-to-one most

246
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,339
ctfs don't give you an opportunity to

247
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:57,600
throw up model

248
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,820
Communications is not usually a core

249
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,240
part of a CTF

250
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,160
on the other hand in my day-to-day I've

251
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,320
actually never seen steganography and

252
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,720
use in in the wild maybe the digital

253
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,060
forensics practitioners on my team have

254
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,880
but I haven't seen any of that I have

255
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,519
however seen a lot of forensics

256
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,500
application I have however seen a lot of

257
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,480
exploitation type of things and of

258
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,220
course

259
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,620
scripting automating our work is always

260
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,100
important

261
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,180
so as a CTF player and if I'm trying to

262
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,740
grow my skill set through that CTF what

263
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,300
I want to do is maximize the time I

264
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,940
spend in that overlap think about the

265
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,440
areas where I can improve the things

266
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,140
that apply in my practitioner uh role

267
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,880
and think about the things that apply in

268
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,920
my CTF role right so looking at

269
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,740
challenges that are in that area can be

270
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,580
something useful

271
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,440
now I did say Communications are not an

272
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,779
integral part of ctfs but I also think

273
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,000
that you can build your skills there if

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
you want to

275
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,080
so a lot of people after playing a CTF

276
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,120
do what we refer to as a write-up which

277
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,800
is a description of how you approach the

278
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,959
problem and found the solution

279
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,519
it tells you a little bit of background

280
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,959
on what the problem was what the

281
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,040
approach you took sometimes you'll

282
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,800
document your dead ends and maybe even

283
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,360
how the vulnerability would translate

284
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,060
into real world impact so I do those

285
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,440
because it helps reinforce what I've

286
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,660
learned during it because I can share

287
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,060
with others uh things that might be

288
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,339
useful for their future application of

289
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:30,620
techniques

290
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,779
and quite frankly writing is a good way

291
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:35,700
to improve your writing skills right you

292
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,260
learn a lot of people learn by doing I'm

293
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,240
certainly one of those people and it's

294
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,220
just an extension past the end of the

295
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,800
CTF time to continue to learn by doing

296
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,000
in terms of teamwork and Leadership I

297
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,800
strongly encourage people to play as

298
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,140
part of a team it's personally a lot

299
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,360
more fun to play as part of a team even

300
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,980
if you're just a sounding board or

301
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,660
rubber ducky for other people on your

302
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,579
team it can be very helpful if you get

303
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:01,740
frustrated if you get stuck you can just

304
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,480
bounce ideas off of someone and

305
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,920
sometimes just explaining the problem

306
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,500
again in simpler terms is enough to get

307
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,180
you to a breakthrough

308
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,279
but it also gets you an opportunity to

309
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,839
have experience with people with other

310
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,760
backgrounds right like like I said one

311
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,320
of the people on our team and I learned

312
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,899
I met them first in playing ctfs Works

313
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,180
in digital forensics right and so I

314
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,680
don't do forensics but I've learned a

315
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,560
ton from having conversations with him

316
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,420
um certainly not an expert at this point

317
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,220
but I still think I've learned a thing

318
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,019
or two that's useful

319
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,760
I also after a number of years I enjoy

320
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,740
mentoring others when people come up and

321
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,899
say I've never played in a CTF I think

322
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,519
that's wonderful it's an opportunity to

323
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,500
introduce someone to something new I

324
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,240
think it's great to tell people who come

325
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,040
in and say like Oh I'm a software

326
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,360
engineer but I want to get into security

327
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,760
that this is a little preview of some of

328
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,380
the technical challenges we face in the

329
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,180
security space

330
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,700
and so being able to to Mentor I think

331
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,440
is a great skill you can grow there as

332
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,180
well

333
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,560
so

334
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,779
some people want to visit the challenges

335
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,459
that they spend all day on or think that

336
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,740
they can further their regular uh role

337
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,120
in and that's certainly a reasonable

338
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,339
approach I like to step outside my

339
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:09,420
comfort zone

340
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,820
uh I like challenging myself with new

341
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,500
things and I also like the fact that

342
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,120
there's very little

343
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,279
downside or risk associated with trying

344
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,260
these if I don't get a CTF challenge it

345
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,640
may be a little bit disappointing but

346
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,160
it's not gonna be a big problem for my

347
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,620
employer or for my career as an

348
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,420
opportunity so if I ever want to play

349
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,740
with a tool I've never played with

350
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,540
before it's a low risk environment to

351
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,640
give it a try in and so you can step

352
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,260
outside your comfort zone and do these

353
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,180
things you've never done before

354
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,640
uh and get into it it actually turns out

355
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,959
a number of things that I was first

356
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,779
exposed to in capture the flag have

357
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,940
since come up in my career in the time

358
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,980
since then I've seen vulnerability

359
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,440
classes that I first saw in a CTF and

360
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,860
then later saw in the real world

361
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,600
I've gotten much better at debugging

362
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,180
some certain types of things from doing

363
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,060
ctfs I understand how to do all kinds of

364
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,420
weird things with GDB if anyone uh

365
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,639
ever spends time in there I could give

366
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,680
an entire separate talk on weird GDB

367
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,940
tricks

368
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,560
um and those have actually come in handy

369
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,139
when trying to debug uh real world

370
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,740
applications

371
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,959
um and another great thing is a lot of

372
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:19,980
ctfs will publish their challenges

373
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,600
afterwards we open source all our

374
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,300
challenge repository for this at the end

375
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,459
of the CTF we also try to leave it up

376
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,139
for a little while

377
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,660
um so long as B-side uh is willing to

378
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,600
continue to pay for the infrastructure

379
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,339
um and it gives you an opportunity

380
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,200
afterwards to come back and take a look

381
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,720
at it in a lower pressure situation or

382
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,160
after someone has done a write-up for

383
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,480
you can look at it right up and you can

384
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,339
go oh so that's how that part worked and

385
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:45,720
then you can actually play with it

386
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,279
Hands-On which if you're a Hands-On

387
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,500
learner I think is a great opportunity

388
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,940
for that

389
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,040
so you can go on CTF time as a site with

390
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,500
a bunch of CTF resources you can go for

391
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,120
links to write-ups you can also go find

392
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,279
some YouTube channels live overflow is a

393
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,920
popular one uh genvale cold wind is

394
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,019
another one these are people who are

395
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,120
security practitioners that also play a

396
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,120
lot of CTF and will start talking about

397
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
how they approach challenges and how

398
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,959
they are looking for Solutions and walk

399
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,139
through some of the things that they do

400
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,940
I want to talk a little bit

401
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,100
whoever wants to design a CTF or wonders

402
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,240
what's going through our minds when

403
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,160
we're writing challenges

404
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,079
um we are not just into it for like the

405
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,639
sadistic nature of giving people hard

406
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,079
problems but

407
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,959
that can be fun sometimes

408
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,700
uh but we really do want to think about

409
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,800
the educational value for a lot of these

410
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,720
ctfs so

411
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,399
um sometimes there's two different types

412
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,000
of audiences I run uh as I said this CTF

413
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,180
and the one at besides Las Vegas as well

414
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,699
um and so those are public ctfs where

415
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,279
people have a wide variety of skills and

416
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,339
interests and backgrounds coming into it

417
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,660
um and maybe have different personal

418
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,000
learning objectives I've also used ctfs

419
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,620
as a teaching tool within my team at

420
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,240
work

421
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
um and or within partner teams at work

422
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,500
and sometimes there you can actually

423
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,360
narrow down the CTF a lot because you

424
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,100
know where people are coming from you

425
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,779
know what their Baseline skill set looks

426
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,519
like and you're usually trying to focus

427
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,220
on one particular type of learning

428
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,260
um I've run one for embedded device

429
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,300
security for example at work because

430
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,000
most of my team had no background in

431
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,560
that space and I really like playing

432
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,099
with devices

433
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,660
um several Studies have shown that

434
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,500
gamification which is a nice buzzword

435
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,899
actually does improve retention improve

436
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,279
performance and improve skill

437
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,699
progression and students think that it

438
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,740
is easier than learning in other ways

439
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,199
whether it actually is or it's just the

440
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,839
fun aspect coming in studies are a

441
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,100
little bit unclear on but there are

442
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,360
studies that show that gamification

443
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,839
helps from an educational perspective

444
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,699
one of the things we really like to do

445
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:54,660
here is we build what we call

446
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,120
Progressive challenges which is where we

447
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,740
build a series of challenge that

448
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,920
introduces New Concepts and ramp up in

449
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,660
complexity so instead of just one

450
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,040
challenge with the ultimate level of

451
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,500
complexity we end up building a couple

452
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,139
of them to get you progressively to the

453
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,880
harder solution

454
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,800
we also like to take challenges with

455
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,380
real world applicability based on real

456
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,600
cves real forensic solutions from our

457
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,760
day jobs

458
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,760
uh one of them that we've done before is

459
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,100
an Android app with SQL injection a lot

460
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,320
of Android apps use SQL Lite as their

461
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
local data storage

462
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,279
um and there have been a few apps that

463
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,139
have had SQL injection via intents which

464
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,639
is how Android apps communicate with

465
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,560
each other

466
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,660
um we've also done a very realistic

467
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,459
environments or a fully functional apps

468
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,839
instead of just being the vulnerability

469
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,699
to exploit

470
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:45,300
um

471
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,040
this year we have a password manager

472
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
that

473
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,279
basically a fully functional password

474
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,660
manager but please don't put any

475
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,579
sensitive credentials in it

476
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,519
but it would work

477
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,259
and then as far as the progressive

478
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,000
challenges we basically think about it

479
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,880
in three stages introducing the concept

480
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,099
adding a little bit of complexity and

481
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,740
then coming to a sort of an edge case or

482
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,339
a particular Nuance of the topic

483
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,919
and we think that it helps the a wide

484
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,480
range of players be able to approach the

485
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,980
topic maybe they get the first one but

486
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,720
not all of them

487
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,160
um maybe they can get a little

488
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,020
confidence boost from starting off with

489
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,059
it uh and just in general it's a great

490
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,439
way to build the skills and layers

491
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,599
instead of trying to make one giant leap

492
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,100
all at once

493
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,140
so in a couple of examples for that is

494
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,580
like trying to get access to an

495
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,919
encrypted file system right an obvious

496
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,419
file system with a known partial

497
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:38,220
password like oh I remember that the

498
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,140
password started with b-sides SF but I

499
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,700
can't remember the end

500
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,980
and you try to crack it from there

501
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,720
second stage maybe you don't remember

502
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,220
anything about the password and then the

503
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,740
third stage like oh and I deleted the

504
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,419
files by accident so now you have to do

505
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,960
file recovery as well as the other steps

506
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,000
there's also ways to approach it for SQL

507
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,500
injection or exploitation type

508
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,840
challenges uh where you give

509
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,360
progressively less feedback to the user

510
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,280
which is actually what you'll see in

511
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,020
more real world cases you won't usually

512
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,299
get like the whole query you submitted

513
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,460
back as an error message unless someone

514
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,200
is horribly misconfigured things

515
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,340
um and as far as like player motivation

516
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,260
we think about the competitiveness the

517
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,539
scoring uh the progression throughout

518
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,820
the game and also the particular skills

519
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,200
that they can build uh throughout that

520
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,400
um so I know this has been kind of a

521
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
whirlwind tour of our approaches to it

522
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,059
and why we think there's educational

523
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:35,520
value in it uh we've got just a minute

524
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,380
or so left but I'm happy to take any

525
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,179
questions that anyone might have in that

526
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,340
time

527
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,440
yes I think we have a microphone for

528
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,799
questions

529
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,940
just so everyone can hear because I know

530
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,140
it's kind of noisy from over there

531
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,380
hi uh uh would you recommend people do

532
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,299
ctfs only if they're interested in doing

533
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,039
security or would you also recommend it

534
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,200
for like software engineers and devs and

535
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,220
stuff like that

536
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,980
I mean you know obviously I have some

537
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,620
bias as a CTF organizer I recommend it

538
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,480
for everyone but if you like solving

539
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,280
puzzles if you like challenges things

540
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,500
like that uh I think you there are

541
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,360
things you can enjoy in it a lot of the

542
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,299
topics are somewhat security focused but

543
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,160
you don't have to have a current career

544
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,780
in security

545
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,580
um I actually played my first CTF before

546
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,039
I was a security practitioner by by day

547
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,320
I was just doing it for fun while as a

548
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,600
site reliability engineer

549
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,059
um and uh transitioned into security

550
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:34,860
later so I think there's a lot of value

551
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,500
in it for anyone who has some interest

552
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,120
in security or some awareness of

553
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,340
security topics

554
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,960
um even like debugging reverse

555
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,280
engineering kind of things or topics

556
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,020
that apply to software engineering as

557
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,960
well as uh you know to security specific

558
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,059
roles

559
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,760
g'day great talk thank you

560
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,919
um when you do the ctfs for your teams

561
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,620
at Google how do you sell the idea to

562
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,080
your managers you know the time

563
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,480
investment and whatever else

564
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,940
um that is a great question

565
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,520
um I guess uh

566
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,980
a lot of it comes down to demonstrating

567
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,799
that there is a need for skill growth in

568
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,679
a particular area uh and then being able

569
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,840
to assemble something

570
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,580
um around that

571
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,799
um

572
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:24,900
the additional part to it is I think at

573
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,059
this point I've worked with my manager

574
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,340
and my director long enough

575
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,559
um to have a sort of a rapport for a lot

576
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,880
of these things they support a lot of

577
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,220
like growth team like team building

578
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,679
exercises as fun activities and also as

579
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,740
uh educational activities so

580
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,460
um

581
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,960
I guess the good news is I don't have to

582
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,640
sell too hard so long as I have a

583
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,559
clearly defined plan for it uh they're

584
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,879
usually on board with the time

585
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,500
yes I think we can take one more

586
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,620
of course I'm on the opposite side of

587
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,400
the room

588
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,400
um what as somebody who's at the app SEC

589
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,799
level or I guess the total SEC level at

590
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,419
Google how do you feel about some of the

591
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,820
platforms like Haiku Pro

592
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,400
um try hack me as sort of a gateway drug

593
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,580
for people who are getting into this

594
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,020
um yeah so I think the question I I

595
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,700
didn't hear all of it but like about the

596
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,860
these platforms like hack the Box uh try

597
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,720
hack me yeah there's a bunch of these

598
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,160
online platforms that have security

599
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,260
challenges of various forms

600
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,780
um so uh hack the Box actually has a

601
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,460
really great Academy that is like very

602
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,840
good at progressing people who are new

603
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,240
into the security space

604
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,980
um

605
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,740
hack the box has a bit of a problem with

606
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,580
uh the boxes being authored by people

607
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,320
who are trying to one-up each other in

608
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,120
weird ways so a lot of them

609
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,280
have strayed very far from what I would

610
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,380
say is something you're going to see in

611
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,059
your day-to-day but I also think they're

612
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,620
fun to play

613
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,380
um so I would say that they are a great

614
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,360
way into it a great way to do it on your

615
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,240
own schedule and things like that

616
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,400
um but I would caution that particularly

617
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,240
the ones that curate boxes from uh the

618
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,039
general submissions that they receive

619
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,380
have a tendency to get more and more

620
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,480
contrived because I think they're trying

621
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,880
to outdo each other and writing a box

622
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,360
yeah

623
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,159
I think we're just about out of time but

624
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,720
I'm going to be in the CTF room all

625
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,280
weekend along with our other CTF

626
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,440
organizers so if you have questions or

627
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,000
think of questions later or want to try

628
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,400
it out uh come visit us

629
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,020
um we're basically at the other end of

630
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,539
the hallway uh Twin Peaks I believe is

631
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,340
the name of the room

632
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,559
um and uh thank you all for attending

633
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,210
the talk

634
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,829
[Applause]
