I'm gonna talk about

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,860
trying to make some method in the

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,979
madness that security is

26
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:09,240
and you know you can find me talking

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,680
security

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,799
at conferences like this I also Mentor

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,439
at security Mentor Club I also work for

30
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,299
the women in cyber security

31
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,220
and in general you can find me talking

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,780
about security sarees dogs food hikes

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,820
any of those countries

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,500
so when Tom actually reached out to me

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,479
about career Village

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,100
I know it's not the best of the times

37
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,920
right now which is why

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,960
I stepped I wanted to help in any way I

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,100
could and my way of helping you all is

40
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,720
uh for lack of any better words

41
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,020
distilling my gray hair into the slides

42
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,420
that I have so I hope it makes some

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,119
sense it's a very um

44
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,640
it's a very click having slide so I'm

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,619
I'm open to sharing slides later on so

46
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,360
you don't need to take any notes it's a

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,299
click heavy slide because then it lets

48
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,280
you go back home and take notes and go

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,640
from there

50
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,399
so that said why are you here at 4 pm

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,739
still listening to me

52
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,560
I have spent over a decade in security I

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,900
am currently at databricks I have worked

54
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,860
at b2bs like databricks mapbox I've

55
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,980
worked at b2cs like fangs

56
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,080
I worked at startups I've worked at

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,660
unicorn rocket ships I've been there

58
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,760
done that I've worn so many hats at this

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,860
point of time that I've covered you know

60
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,780
I've been a security software engineer

61
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,580
I'm a detection engineer incidence

62
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,560
response engineer I've been giving

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,860
interviews since 2013 and I've been

64
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,560
taking interviews since 2020 so that's a

65
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,120
lot of breadth a lot of hats that I've

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,920
covered over the years

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,440
and like it or not some people might

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,940
burn out but I'm still here talking

69
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,620
about security

70
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,840
so in this talk today I'm going to cover

71
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,980
a few

72
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,860
um two aspects of interviewing you know

73
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,000
one is

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,980
how do you interview for the different

75
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,019
roles in security

76
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:05,700
because there's so many kinds of roles

77
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,080
you cannot prepare for everything when

78
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,160
you are interviewing as a security

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,900
engineer you can be so many different

80
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,879
kinds and each of them need a different

81
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,280
way of preparation and the second the

82
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,099
other side is how do you hire for these

83
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,200
kind of roles because as a manager

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
you're constantly shifting between

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,900
different roles different skills

86
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,659
different people different countries how

87
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,580
do you make sense of that so that's what

88
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,900
we're going to try to cover in the next

89
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,159
20 minutes

90
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,800
vicious luck

91
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,260
so this slide that you see here is

92
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,780
intentionally very text Heavy

93
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,599
but it has almost all the categories

94
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,840
that security means to different people

95
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,019
this is the Mind map of a seesaw it's

96
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,940
been on my wall for the last five years

97
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,700
because even I lose track of it

98
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,099
so one side that you see is you you have

99
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,720
risk and governance you know features

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,560
like

101
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,360
a lot of people who do this on a daily

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,519
basis of how risky is your business how

103
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,379
risk is the product can we buy cyber

104
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,760
insurance for a company and those kind

105
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,900
of decisions

106
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,760
the next set of decisions and the people

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,400
and the teams working are business risks

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,680
you have your Disaster Recovery your

109
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,659
business continuity plan

110
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,120
right ensuring all the processes all the

111
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,478
plans work as a as expected all of that

112
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,940
the third category is compliance legal

113
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,240
uh you know it to people outside of

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,560
compliance and legal it seems very

115
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,160
tedious but in my opinion it's it's one

116
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,960
of the quickest way to gain your

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,000
customers trust so if you have a new

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,100
product in the market and you have a

119
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,960
sock tool or some kind of compliance I

120
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,479
as a buyer would know that you have at

121
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,639
least certain checklists done and

122
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,440
hopefully done the right way

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,900
so I can trust your process

124
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,699
on the other side this is what I'm going

125
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,080
to talk about the next three ones which

126
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,139
are in the trenches more of I see work

127
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,540
more of people like probably most of you

128
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,139
here that would be secops which is a lot

129
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,759
of the operational in the trenches

130
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,199
reactive

131
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,720
alerts report responding to alerts doing

132
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,699
pen testing Etc

133
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:08,400
then we have the infrastructure side you

134
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,840
are probably an engineer working to

135
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,759
protect your infrastructure

136
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,000
or you're an engineer trying to protect

137
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,919
improve your own product security so

138
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,080
these are roughly the

139
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,780
the groups and as you can see it's not

140
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,880
easy right so it's so many things so

141
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,259
when you say I'm interviewing as a

142
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,840
security engineer you could mean any one

143
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,820
of these things

144
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,120
so if we were interviewing I'm not gonna

145
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,620
go to the first three I'm gonna go to

146
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,479
the next three

147
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,180
but I'm sure many of you me included

148
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,620
have been in these kind of interviews

149
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,139
where I've been asked random terrible

150
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,300
questions not related to my workspace at

151
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,380
all

152
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,500
so here's my note to all of you when you

153
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,180
are interviewing for a company it's a

154
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,280
two-way street if you don't understand

155
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,840
what's being interviewed why you're

156
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,240
answering certain questions chances are

157
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,039
it's not a good place to work either

158
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,660
so skip that take it as a two-way

159
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,880
interview two-way street ask them the

160
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,960
equal questions and we'll see deeper how

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,320
so the first category of interviews that

162
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,880
we often or I have often given is

163
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,000
product you know I'm building and my

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,280
company sells security products for

165
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,020
example at Palo Alto right so you build

166
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,520
firewalls

167
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,199
you have a lot of the information in

168
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,940
there and you can see the common titles

169
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,699
and roles are pretty much very common

170
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,340
like software engineer Cloud security

171
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,380
engineer network security engineer all

172
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,680
of these kinds the skills you need here

173
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,680
they are mostly uh your basics of

174
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,180
computer science that you need

175
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,460
you're a software engineer first then a

176
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,660
security engineer so you can skip past

177
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,940
the security classes if you want if you

178
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,500
want to go down this direction

179
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,180
but you also need to understand your

180
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,979
business a little bit because you can't

181
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,120
build good features without

182
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,740
understanding what your company sells

183
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,120
anyways

184
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,860
so these are the titles these are the

185
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,120
skills

186
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,400
coming next is

187
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,100
how do you hone your craft if you want

188
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,680
to be a software security engineer this

189
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,660
is not an exhaustive list this is a list

190
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,240
that works for me but the idea that you

191
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
should go away with is you should have

192
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,520
your elevator pitch ready as a software

193
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,319
engineer if you're interviewing for one

194
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,580
of these if I ask you here what do you

195
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,020
do

196
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,419
second is you should try looking at all

197
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,639
the regular software engineering

198
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,319
interview questions that's out there in

199
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,639
the market out there on the internet

200
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,819
cdci lead code etc etc practice practice

201
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,900
it because that's what makes you less

202
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,560
um

203
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,840
practice where you fight so if you

204
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,880
practice in the right places you're most

205
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,319
likely going to be nailing those

206
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,180
interviews

207
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,340
you can also start given how hard the

208
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,139
job market is right now you might not be

209
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,360
getting many calls etc etc so you might

210
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,220
start looking at open source projects

211
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,020
because that's where you're building up

212
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,180
your you know your resume your portfolio

213
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,440
you're working

214
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,599
and you're also helping some open source

215
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,940
Community uh build products which a lot

216
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,099
of us in the industry often use

217
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,199
and last but not the least

218
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,479
if you go down as a regular software

219
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,639
security engineer you are potentially

220
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,620
allowing your career and your movement

221
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,240
in and out of very many different

222
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,300
software products it could be a database

223
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,280
developer next or a spark developer Etc

224
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,840
you don't have to stick to security

225
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:28,080
the next is proactive set of roles these

226
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,660
are security specific roles

227
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,659
where you're looking at either improving

228
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,940
or securing your product or improving

229
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,000
and securing your infrastructure by that

230
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,299
I mean you know for example if I build

231
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,660
if my company sells potatoes how can I

232
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,660
secure the potato as in like are there

233
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,860
any bugs in it are there any

234
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,600
vulnerabilities in it can I scan it

235
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,399
that's project

236
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,500
how can I protect the farm which is your

237
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,360
infrastructure for growing so that's

238
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,720
possibly AWS Azure gcp wherever you're

239
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,980
building your infrastructure so that's

240
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,080
corporate infra security and then you

241
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,120
also have bits and pieces of Enterprise

242
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,519
security thrown in for example

243
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,980
how does your company configure OCTA or

244
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,140
what do you do with lastpasser

245
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,019
I hope no LastPass person here but all

246
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:18,899
of those things put together is your

247
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,899
proactive security engineering when you

248
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,660
are in this field or in this roles you

249
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,880
should focus on preparing more as a

250
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,100
security engineer first

251
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,680
you might not have the greatest

252
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,420
coding skills

253
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,920
but if you start preparing a security

254
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,540
engineering skills and bring up your

255
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,399
coding skills later on that's totally

256
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,500
fine

257
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,140
for improving um you know for improving

258
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,120
interviews and talking more about

259
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,600
this line of work I would say uh all the

260
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,560
list here

261
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,519
and shout out to projects like Yara

262
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,640
the ovasp cheat sheet you have OS query

263
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,860
rather these are all I mean look up

264
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,540
GitHub for security projects you will

265
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,399
see the most hard projects pick anything

266
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,080
that suits you start contributing

267
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,700
because the minute you contribute you

268
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,140
have something

269
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,019
to show to an interviewer that hey I

270
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,820
have done this piece of coding so that

271
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,260
itself is half a battle one there

272
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,459
oh last but not the least I want to call

273
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,440
out the sixth bullet point

274
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,660
for the longest time I never had a good

275
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,600
ctci equivalent for security engineering

276
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,000
and then Tad came up about two years

277
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,459
back he put up a very rough list of

278
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,740
security engineering questions I don't

279
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,180
think it's been updated much since then

280
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,980
but it is the best that we have out

281
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,080
there so if you want to look in one

282
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,720
place what all do I need to answer

283
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,040
I would start off from there

284
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,380
the third category and I'm smiling

285
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,880
because that's what I do right now the

286
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,660
third category is reactive security Ops

287
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,959
this set of roles is

288
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,720
mostly your IR Ops your investigations

289
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,459
your threat hunting your detection

290
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,019
engineering your forensics analyst

291
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,180
you're red teaming all of these comes in

292
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,540
as reactive roles so the skills that you

293
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,519
need here actually the first skill I

294
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,680
would hire for is resilience and

295
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,579
integrity

296
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,800
you will have burnout if you don't have

297
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,600
these two and if you can't keep up with

298
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,579
the pace because it's an incredibly fast

299
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:20,279
moving it's a roller coaster ride I can

300
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,959
walk into the office on morning and be

301
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,420
like oh wow or oh no so it can go either

302
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,980
ways

303
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,660
but then comes the technical skills you

304
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,160
still need you know you still need to

305
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,600
know the tools of the trade you need

306
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,459
your store you need your hunting skills

307
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,920
you need SQL pretty much quite a lot you

308
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,779
need to know how to pass through large

309
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,240
amount of data logs everything else in

310
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,399
there so all of that put together makes

311
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,860
it reactive security which is very close

312
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,120
to

313
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,279
being a roller coaster ride but you can

314
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,320
also burn out

315
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,380
for these I would say the first thing is

316
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,180
you should say is hey I survived these

317
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,220
many years doing IR or I survived these

318
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,860
many years doing pen testing that to me

319
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,899
is the biggest fact that you're still

320
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,060
talking about it means you are you've

321
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,860
survived it you want to do it and you're

322
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,200
doing it for the right reasons

323
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,779
a lot of the learning that comes in from

324
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:11,760
here is where most of the hacking

325
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,579
resources come in you might want to look

326
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,980
at security conferences as well because

327
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,260
you know conferences like these end up

328
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,660
having a lot of hacking conversations as

329
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,300
well so on the list here you want to

330
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,220
talk about

331
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,860
conferences hacking uh expertise is do

332
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,440
do the ctfs that have that conferences

333
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,640
have

334
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,320
if you don't want to do that part but

335
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,700
that's a very half visit path if you

336
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,959
don't want to do that path you can also

337
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,480
go look up any course any online

338
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,339
certification which

339
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,740
I'm I'm not pro or Force for

340
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,899
certifications I just think it's a good

341
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,320
way to give a structured learning that

342
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,660
you would need to nail that role so if

343
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,160
you want to look at some roles there and

344
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,380
look at some incident handling courses

345
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,579
that would be the place to go

346
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,899
so that's it we have covered the three

347
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,540
series of interview tracks we have the

348
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,100
product where you build security

349
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,980
products we have the proactive improving

350
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,839
shift left security and then you have

351
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,639
the reacting where you are fighting

352
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,399
fires day in Day Out

353
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,500
now comes to hiring

354
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,720
if you thought giving an interview is

355
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,700
hard which it is it's nerve-wracking if

356
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,100
you thought giving an interview is hard

357
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,899
try taking interviews for a hundred

358
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:25,800
people

359
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,920
and B standard evaluation you're fair

360
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,660
you don't have your subconscious bias

361
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,399
you you are doing the right things day

362
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,959
in day out while you're interviewing

363
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,880
those hundred people it's incredibly

364
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,019
hard if you want to do the right thing

365
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,480
which is also why when you're giving an

366
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,920
interview you never know it went well or

367
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,139
not because it's very subjective today

368
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:45,180
so how do you make

369
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,060
a very subjective process into a more

370
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,760
detail or a more standardized outcome so

371
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,740
you're hiring for the right skills

372
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,600
rather than what you think is the right

373
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,399
person

374
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,500
some things that have worked for me are

375
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,480
outlined here you don't have to follow

376
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,279
them but they have made my life easier

377
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,139
which is why they're on the slide

378
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,480
the first is preparation

379
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,040
actually the first two slides are

380
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,839
preparation the first preparation that I

381
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,139
do is for my team anybody and everybody

382
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,660
whenever they're joining every quarter

383
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,579
every once in a while every one-on-one

384
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,380
gives me a chance to go and look at the

385
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,899
skills and capabilities Matrix

386
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,480
on the left

387
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,300
I dump out everything that I think my

388
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,519
team needs it doesn't have to be filled

389
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,200
in by one person it can be filled in by

390
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,300
15 people but that's the list my

391
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,540
business needs from my team it can be

392
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,160
something as stupid as industry Network

393
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,660
how do you how do you quantify that

394
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,160
there's no degree for industry Network

395
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,519
or it can be as technical as rootkits

396
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,019
and containers right but it's all there

397
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,760
it's all on that page

398
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,519
if you make it available to your team

399
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,459
your team knows what you want they know

400
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,899
the transparency they know where they

401
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,760
can grow their career they know what

402
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,279
gaps exist and not only that they will

403
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,660
sometimes come in and be like hey Arpita

404
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,100
you know what I want to learn that skill

405
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,019
next can you help me do that so that

406
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,760
makes your job as a hiring manager much

407
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,779
easier

408
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,899
what it also does is it lets you do

409
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,519
targeted hiring

410
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,440
it's very painful to maintain this list

411
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,820
up to date but I think it's worth it

412
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,440
because at the end it allows you to do

413
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,180
what I'm gonna show next which is

414
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,579
targeted hiring but also it helps you be

415
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,680
a better nurturer or a retainer of your

416
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,519
talent in the team

417
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,980
so this when you see is that Gap list

418
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,320
that I've identified and put it in an

419
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,940
interview panel

420
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,100
once you've identified your gaps what

421
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,899
next you need a series of people to

422
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,940
interview your candidates right so that

423
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,560
can happen in two ways

424
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,620
it can either be like hey five people go

425
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,940
interview this candidate they'll come

426
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,440
back saying great not great you don't

427
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,940
quite know what is why is someone

428
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,279
greater why someone not great

429
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,779
or you can give them this evaluation

430
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,480
Matrix where you say hey if you are if

431
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,160
you are interviewing a candidate for me

432
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,440
at an L3 level this is what I expect

433
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,899
them to be if you're and then you go

434
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,899
down and you see L6 it's all that L3 has

435
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:12,060
all that L4 has going on and on and on

436
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,399
and then you add layers to that onion

437
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,560
and so it makes it very easy for your

438
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,800
interview panel to hire and interview a

439
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,260
person that you want rather than they

440
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,300
would want on their team so it allows

441
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,880
you to hire it allows you to

442
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,760
ask people to evaluate using their

443
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,860
intelligence but yours your selection

444
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,019
criteria

445
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,440
having done these two prep materials

446
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,779
dear now now you come to the actual

447
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,579
hiring this is all pre-hiring before you

448
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,139
open open your legs so when you come to

449
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,440
hiring you need to do about six or seven

450
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,800
things one don't try to hire unicorns

451
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,660
none of us are unicorns being a unicorn

452
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,339
is extremely challenging extremely

453
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,199
burning out we will not have security

454
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,959
people if we try if we continue hiring

455
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,360
unicorns

456
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,480
second is keep the skills and

457
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,240
capabilities Matrix very up to date

458
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,099
once you have that up to date half your

459
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,599
job is done as a manager because then

460
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,400
you know what to hire for which

461
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,500
candidates to go for where to Showcase

462
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,380
you know my I need a gap I have a gap in

463
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,720
gcp okay fine go to a Google conference

464
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,179
you will find TCP candidates there

465
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,459
then be very cognizant of

466
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,860
um you know what you write in your job

467
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,559
description you don't want to copy paste

468
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,840
a same job wreck from five different

469
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,460
wrecks because then you're hiring the

470
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,020
same kind of candidate every time which

471
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,140
does not improve your diversity

472
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,480
so when you once you write down try to

473
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,299
minimize it to five to seven items that

474
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,340
you need on the mid on the candidate and

475
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,559
that's it and you will not find unicorns

476
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,020
but you will find the exact kind of

477
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,080
candidate that you're looking for

478
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,280
then

479
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,720
sometimes and I've seen this when I'm

480
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,880
hiring in different countries uh of late

481
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,980
is because everyone's on video every

482
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,780
country has a different video bandwidth

483
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,520
every country has a different holiday

484
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,559
month every country has different

485
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,500
cultural jokes so when you are hiring as

486
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,840
a manager if you if you are not

487
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,780
cognizant of the workings that someone

488
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,760
could have a different working style a

489
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,520
different uh thinking style a different

490
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,740
language style you're missing out on a

491
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,240
lot of thought diversity that would

492
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,100
actually benefit your team

493
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,039
so when you have that list there and you

494
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,360
know which which countries or

495
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,460
geolocations you're hiring for what gaps

496
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,900
you have

497
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,179
put it in your evaluation Matrix stick

498
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,700
to it and then you will have a holistic

499
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,039
and diverse interview panel

500
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,480
which will give you the kind of

501
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,460
candidates that you're looking for and

502
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,200
the interview candidates would then fit

503
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,760
into one of the three buckets that I

504
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,620
shared earlier

505
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,539
so going back interviews are a two-way

506
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:52,500
street

507
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,080
if you are interviewing and you don't

508
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,940
like the team you're talking to

509
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,340
stick to your gut it's harder to do in a

510
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,780
job market like this

511
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,820
so I'm take that with a pinch of salt at

512
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,380
least for the next six months

513
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,179
but also when you're

514
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,740
the hiring manager for an interview

515
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,660
check in with the candidates they might

516
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,039
not have liked the experience which you

517
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,360
thought was amazing and you spent so

518
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,460
much time preparing for it so be open to

519
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,080
that feedback as a hiring manager

520
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,280
because

521
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,080
what you see what you think they're

522
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,280
getting is probably not what they're

523
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,380
getting

524
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,500
so that was my uh gray hair in a slight

525
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,460
deck

526
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,559
and that said I'm also available in all

527
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,820
of these places

528
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,220
happy to answer any questions now and or

529
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,740
later if they come up

530
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,940
but

531
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,240
all right
