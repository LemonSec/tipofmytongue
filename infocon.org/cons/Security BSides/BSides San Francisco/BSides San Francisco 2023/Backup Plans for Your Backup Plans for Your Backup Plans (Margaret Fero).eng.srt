1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:02,639
good afternoon everyone my name is

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,319
Margaret Farrow I am the head of

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,720
corporate security at La Decora and if

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,580
you want to tweet or mess it on or

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,460
whatever my pronouns are they them

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,559
today we are going to talk about backup

7
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,900
plans for your backup plans for your

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,180
backup plans

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,180
this image is a NASA photo of Catherine

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,640
Johnson at her desk she calculated Ellen

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,019
Shepard's trajectory for the flight

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,640
where he became the first American in

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,640
space among many other voyages but one

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,380
of her Specialties was calculating

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,540
backup navigation charts for astronauts

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,920
to use in the case of electronic

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,500
failures and so we hope to channel that

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,600
energy as we dedicate our efforts to

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,160
hopefully less life or death backup

20
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,780
plans here today

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,059
you might notice the image citations as

22
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,579
we go through are all with NASA image

23
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,079
numbers these are all from a really cool

24
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,399
Gallery where you can find these and

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,379
many more space images

26
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,539
today I'm going to start you off with

27
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,239
what I'm calling acronym soup this is a

28
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,640
bcdr talk I didn't say that in the intro

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,899
you may have been tricked into coming

30
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,059
here but we're going to start off by

31
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,159
discussing some core terms and Concepts

32
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,560
in bcdr and other continuity planning

33
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,360
just to make sure that everybody is on

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
board with that then I will have an

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,299
opportunity for people to ask

36
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,979
terminology questions please do limit

37
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,600
that to just a few questions about key

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,920
terms and then I'll take broader

39
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,600
questions at the end but I do want to

40
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,100
make sure that nobody is getting lost

41
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,259
kind of right off the bat if there is

42
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,939
something you're unsure of there's

43
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,380
almost definitely somebody else who's

44
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,939
also unsure of it so please don't

45
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,380
hesitate to ask questions during that

46
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,000
section if you have any

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,100
then we are going to talk about business

48
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,560
continuity when it's going well I call

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,000
this business continuity as usual but

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
we're going to start with an idealized

51
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,180
version then we will discuss business

52
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,119
continuity for your business continuity

53
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,159
before going a little bit into how you

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,060
can plan for unplanned plan failures

55
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,920
first off when we're talking about

56
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,140
backup plans in a security context there

57
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,259
tend to be a lot of acronyms in play

58
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:56,159
hopefully many of you are already

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,020
familiar with these but just in case

60
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,520
you're not we're going to start with a

61
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,780
little review of some of the terminology

62
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,280
that might come up either during this

63
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,720
talk or during the question and answers

64
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,700
after

65
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,619
first off some terms that I've already

66
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,538
used business continuity and business

67
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,819
continuity plan or planning business

68
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,099
continuity is almost exactly what it

69
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,840
sounds like it is ensuring that the

70
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,819
business can continue to go about its

71
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,680
daily operations when people are talking

72
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
about business continuity they usually

73
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,760
mean continuing to go about your normal

74
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,260
operations in the face of something

75
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,480
having gone wrong

76
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,700
your business continuity plan or the

77
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,860
business continuity planning process are

78
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,319
how you come up with a strategy or a

79
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,300
plan in advance so that when something

80
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,099
goes wrong you know how you will ensure

81
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,800
business continuity

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,900
Disaster Recovery is a slightly

83
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,340
different but closely related concept

84
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,080
here we're specifically talking about

85
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,620
disasters go a large thing going wrong

86
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,540
this often refers to things like

87
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,940
recovering from a fire or a flood or a

88
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,160
data center outage or a broken air

89
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,959
conditioning system in a room that had a

90
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,420
bunch of your on-prem servers in it and

91
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,459
Disaster Recovery plan or planning is

92
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,860
again what you've written in advance as

93
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,540
kind of a strategic document hopefully

94
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,120
some detailed procedures and the process

95
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,280
of coming up with those so that you can

96
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,519
be ready when those things happen

97
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,120
you may also see bcdr with or without a

98
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,040
slash these are both exactly the same

99
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,519
thing and here we have an image of

100
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,040
Hubble viewing two galaxies merging

101
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,319
because very much like two galaxies

102
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,800
emerging in this space photo bcdr is

103
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,300
just the combination of business

104
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,819
continuity and Disaster Recovery all in

105
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,819
one we're talking here about the kind of

106
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,860
combined holistic approach to ensuring

107
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,599
that business continues in the event of

108
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,959
an emergency

109
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,040
um finally here we've got a business

110
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,140
impact analysis a business impact

111
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,780
analysis is a way of calculating in

112
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,120
advance what the likely effect on the

113
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,099
continuance of business operations is

114
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,140
going to be if something goes wrong that

115
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,340
can be an important part of your risk

116
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,560
planning

117
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,420
some other common terms that might come

118
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,879
up in the course of this include crisis

119
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,980
event or incident these are all slightly

120
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,360
different but we're going to talk about

121
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,980
all of them in conjunction with each

122
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,140
other a lot today because really

123
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,420
anything along the crisis event or

124
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,639
incident scale is going to be a business

125
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,680
continuity event and a situation in

126
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,260
which you may want to activate your BCP

127
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,940
we're also going to talk a little bit

128
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,620
about incident response activating an

129
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,479
incident response process is a certain

130
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,360
type of business continuity activity but

131
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,759
this is specifically usually when

132
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,199
there's something that your organization

133
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,880
has determined to be an incident is

134
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,800
happening a crisis is often something

135
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,720
affecting many different organizations

136
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,300
though you may also encounter it in the

137
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,979
context of like Crisis Communications

138
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,720
especially if you work with your PR team

139
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,100
at all

140
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,740
um an event is not necessarily going to

141
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,080
be rising to the level of a crisis or an

142
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,419
incident but is instead something that

143
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,880
has happened that was either unexpected

144
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,919
or that was expected but maybe a little

145
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,380
bit unusual

146
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,720
um we also might talk about recovery

147
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,820
point or recovery Point objective often

148
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,100
an acronym

149
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,800
anachronomized as RP or RPO as well as

150
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,800
RT or RTO recovery time or recovery time

151
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,320
objective these kind of interlock with

152
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,780
each other so your RPO is the state of

153
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,639
the system you hope to return to usually

154
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,979
referring to data loss and the recovery

155
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,800
point is the kind of point in relation

156
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,680
to things having

157
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,720
um in relation to the recovery having

158
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,520
begun that you're going to get back to

159
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,440
that in some cases you may be able to

160
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,360
tolerate up to several minutes lost data

161
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,340
or even longer while in others

162
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,500
especially Finance or similar any data

163
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,120
loss may be unacceptable and so it's

164
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,820
important to set out a shared recovery

165
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,699
Point objective in advance the recovery

166
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,080
point is what you actually end up

167
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,699
getting to recovery Point objective is

168
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,440
where you want to go to and then the

169
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,940
recovery time and recovery time

170
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,919
objective are the same general type of

171
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,080
concept but instead it's how long it

172
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,940
takes you to restore the system to that

173
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,000
state once the recovery activities start

174
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,220
I'm going to talk very generally here

175
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,479
it's going to be fast and loose and a

176
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,220
little sloppy about risk and risk

177
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,919
assessments if you want more specific

178
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,780
discussions on risk we can absolutely do

179
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,880
that in the hallway after but here I'm

180
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,620
going to lump kind of all of business

181
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,080
and Technical risk together just so that

182
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,360
we don't have to get too too specific

183
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,860
about the types of risk that you might

184
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,600
be handling in a business continuity

185
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,199
scenario

186
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,400
um with that said before we move on to

187
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,020
business continuity as usual I'm going

188
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,340
to stay on this one so that I can see

189
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,660
you in the audience in case anyone is

190
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,220
Raising hands does anyone have any

191
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,900
questions about this terminology before

192
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,520
we go into

193
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,139
kind of jumping straight into the

194
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,440
content

195
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,979
excellent let's continue then

196
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,800
business continuity as usual

197
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,139
we are going to talk about the ideal

198
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,180
business continuity state that you could

199
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,180
be in here you've got a vast library of

200
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,340
resources ready to activate for any of

201
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,960
the common scenarios you might encounter

202
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,120
you are ready for voluntary departures

203
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,160
of key people you are ready for layoffs

204
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,139
and firings you are ready for fires

205
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,539
floods anything that could possibly

206
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,100
disrupt your business

207
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,960
we're going to start talking about the

208
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,300
dream BCP that you could have in this

209
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,340
ideal situation with the full knowledge

210
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,800
that nobody actually has all of this in

211
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
a row unless you are very skilled and

212
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,319
very lucky and very well supported by

213
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,780
the rest of your business even the

214
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,220
largest and most mature companies and

215
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,720
government organizations aren't actually

216
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,460
going to have all of this but first

217
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,900
we're going to talk about what you might

218
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,300
strive for if you could have literally

219
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,000
anything you wanted

220
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
so these are some of the covered

221
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,039
scenarios that your ideal business

222
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,960
continuity plan would address

223
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,580
fire and flood are pretty

224
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,039
self-explanatory here a utility outage

225
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,380
could be electricity or water to an

226
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,840
office or to a data center a course

227
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,160
service outage is where everybody's

228
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,479
favorites come in that's where we're

229
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,460
talking about DNS outages that's where

230
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,400
we're talking about AWS Us East one all

231
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,960
those types of things

232
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,300
a disease outbreak is the one everybody

233
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,639
used to joke about even the CDC they had

234
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,979
a really cool zombie plan but probably

235
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,360
one of the most frequent ones that

236
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,800
you've handled lately if you're working

237
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,960
on a BCP at all in a company right now

238
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,599
uh temporary loss of a key person could

239
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,699
be where you lose internet but only to

240
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,979
one person's house or there's not a

241
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,840
whole outbreak of a disease but the one

242
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,899
person who does get sick is the CFO

243
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,599
and they need to sign things

244
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,979
um departure of a key person you

245
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,360
hopefully get a little bit more notice

246
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,799
for there should be a transition plan

247
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,779
there ideally that succession plan is

248
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,099
really a part of your continuity

249
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:46,020
planning as well

250
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,279
um but you need to solve the problem

251
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,380
longer term maybe a key holder moved on

252
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,899
to a new role in your organization or

253
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,700
you are otherwise losing some

254
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,320
institutional knowledge

255
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,180
a malware infestation could include

256
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,160
things like ransomware as well as other

257
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,779
infections where you maybe can't trust

258
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,600
Key Systems anymore and region-specific

259
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,160
disasters are going to be things like

260
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,320
the power going out because it stayed

261
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,420
really cold for a long time in Texas or

262
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,040
there's an earthquake in an area with a

263
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,440
fault line there's a hurricane a tornado

264
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,420
a tsunami things that you don't expect

265
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,040
to have happening everywhere that you

266
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,540
have Personnel in a remote environment

267
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,040
or in a larger corporate environment

268
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,500
with multiple offices but that you do

269
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,540
expect with some regularity in the areas

270
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,459
that are affected by them and at varying

271
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,200
levels of severity

272
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,120
there are also a couple more scenarios

273
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,560
you'll want to cover like various

274
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,060
violent threats to the building but this

275
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,160
is an ideal BCP so we're going to assume

276
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,779
that all of the scenarios that are not

277
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,700
covered on this slide are also covered

278
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,700
and you've got resources ready so to

279
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,380
address each of these scenarios you will

280
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,420
use some combination of these fully

281
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,640
tested tools and probably some others

282
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
but these ones are super common to see

283
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,320
in a BCP you've got expert resources

284
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,060
you've got data backups you've got

285
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,920
backup office locations you've got

286
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,080
pre-written support macros you've got IR

287
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,959
run books policies and procedures backup

288
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,300
Services cross-trained backup people and

289
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,420
PR training

290
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,080
you

291
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,760
um for your expert resources you're

292
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,260
going to have people like your legal

293
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,300
teams maybe some medical professionals

294
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,040
for the disease outbreak situation on

295
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,680
call your communication stuff and anyone

296
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,600
else you need specialized advice from on

297
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,820
how to act in this specific type of

298
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,399
situation your policies and procedures

299
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,899
should tell the vast majority of the

300
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,220
business how they should proceed in

301
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,080
these situations and hopefully everyone

302
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,300
is familiar with those before you need

303
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,440
them

304
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,540
because if nobody knows that you have a

305
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,000
policy let alone what it is beforehand

306
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,040
you have approximately a zero percent

307
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,260
chance of it getting used in an actual

308
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,180
disaster situation

309
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,160
hopefully you have some data backups as

310
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,779
well as backup services like a power

311
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,060
generator or another AWS region ready to

312
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,519
go where applicable

313
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,440
um if you typically have people working

314
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,420
out of offices a backup office location

315
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,339
even if that's everybody go home and

316
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,260
pick back up there is really important

317
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,459
for any event that would shut your

318
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,800
office down for all of those key person

319
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,240
risks you hopefully have some

320
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,800
cross-trained backup people who can take

321
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,360
over a task if that initial person

322
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,000
becomes unavailable and for corporate

323
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,620
Communications about the kinds of

324
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,480
incidents that make the news ideally

325
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,920
there are some pre-written support

326
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,620
macros to help that team enabled to do

327
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,720
their jobs as well as PR training for

328
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,740
anybody who might have to give

329
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,480
interviews and people who are involved

330
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,820
in IR for technical incidents

331
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,140
um sorry for people who are involved in

332
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,820
IR for technical incidents you hopefully

333
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,100
have your run books or your playbooks or

334
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,660
whatever your organization likes to call

335
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,760
that big thick packet of detailed

336
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,260
procedures and supplementary information

337
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,540
calling out exactly what should be done

338
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,519
in the event of an incident and who

339
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,740
needs to do each bit of it

340
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,839
so let's say you're in one of those

341
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,700
covered scenarios you are experiencing

342
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,040
the temporary loss of a key person

343
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,160
your CEO has a really bad cold like the

344
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,440
worst cold and cannot get work done at

345
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,600
all maybe they lost their voice and

346
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,160
their eyes are runny they can't even see

347
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,600
the computer screen well enough to work

348
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,360
if they wanted to

349
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,399
the first step that your BCP has covered

350
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,200
for you is that a couple of other people

351
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,060
have PR training

352
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,980
anytime the CEO has to skip an event

353
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,180
because of their cold you've got

354
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,920
somebody ready to show up and give an

355
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,480
excellent speech about how the business

356
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,519
is doing great and they can cover any

357
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,380
public-facing questions about canceled

358
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,360
appearances

359
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,279
next you're going to use some of those

360
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,040
pre-written support macros maybe the CEO

361
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,079
is a figurehead and your email your

362
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,820
users are emailing you disappointed

363
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,440
because they missed an appearance that

364
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,700
people had been really looking forward

365
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,459
to but your support team is already

366
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:37,200
prepared with some heartfelt words from

367
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,959
the CEO about how valuable the users are

368
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,240
because your CEO getting sick is a thing

369
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,100
that's going to happen eventually and so

370
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,660
you can anticipate this and have them

371
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,339
write this who the support team has it

372
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,980
on hand when it happens this allows the

373
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,959
CEO to tell the users directly that they

374
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:52,860
regret they couldn't make this

375
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,480
appearance even if they aren't in any

376
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,279
state to write an email at the time when

377
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,320
it happens

378
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,200
finally cross-trained backup people if

379
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,000
your CEO is out sick there are some

380
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,040
decisions you should probably delay but

381
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,600
hopefully other Executives have the

382
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,220
background information and the trusting

383
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,200
relationship with the CEO that they can

384
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,480
still keep key initiatives unblocked and

385
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,480
moving while your CEO is out this allows

386
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,639
the CEO to wait until they actually feel

387
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,380
better to come back and when they come

388
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,240
back they are not coming back to a pile

389
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,500
of everything that happened while they

390
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,899
were gone being stuck which is never the

391
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,220
thing you want the first day back to

392
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,200
work

393
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,480
having successfully implemented your

394
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,220
business continuity plan in this perfect

395
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,139
world where you have unlimited resources

396
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,820
you are now feeling great about yourself

397
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,399
you are well prepared and executed your

398
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,680
plan successfully allowing your CEO time

399
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,839
to rest and recuperate maybe other

400
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,459
businesses would have forced them back

401
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:47,519
to work early but not you this is the

402
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,639
dream

403
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,360
however this is not typically how things

404
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,700
go you may not have everything you need

405
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,740
in place before an event happens and

406
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,380
unfortunately incidents and crises and

407
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,480
anything along that Spectrum are not

408
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,300
nearly so polite us to take turns so you

409
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,040
might find especially the last couple of

410
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,899
years that you are not handling one

411
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,880
adverse event with three well-formed

412
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,519
Advanced mitigations but instead several

413
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,320
events with maybe one of your

414
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,360
mitigations working as expected if

415
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,720
you're lucky

416
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,800
this is where you need business

417
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,260
continuity for your business continuity

418
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,200
in early 1966 the crew of The Gemini 8

419
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,760
mission were the first to link two

420
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,100
spacecraft together in Earth orbit

421
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,959
various technical controls were in place

422
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,940
to ensure successful docking and if they

423
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,440
ran into trouble the Gemini had a

424
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,420
command to Take Over Control of the

425
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,339
second spacecraft the agina in the case

426
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,680
of attitude control failures was a

427
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,300
particular area that they seem to have

428
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,160
been worried about because there were a

429
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,560
ton of extra controls around that

430
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,959
the ajino was supposed to obey orders

431
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,060
from both Gemini and Ground Control note

432
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,100
that redundancy coming in there Mission

433
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,839
Control was also available for live

434
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,459
assistance if further troubleshooting

435
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,800
procedures needed to be enacted however

436
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,600
just after the two spacecraft

437
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,399
successfully docked completing the core

438
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,160
portion of their mission a yaw Thruster

439
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,440
in the orbital attitude and maneuvering

440
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,980
system or oams misfired as it turns out

441
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,660
later probably because of a short

442
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,920
circuit

443
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,260
this unfortunately happened just after

444
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,120
they left the communications range of

445
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Mission Control one of those layers down

446
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,199
and even though that was planned it

447
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,019
still reduced the redundancy available

448
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:36,060
the spacecraft began to Tumble and using

449
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,279
the oams thrusters to stop the tumbling

450
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,740
didn't stop the roll for long

451
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,420
the crew initially suspected that

452
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,800
something had gone wrong with the ajina

453
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,420
the spacecraft that they had adopted to

454
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,300
and so they undocked and backed away but

455
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,339
without the agina's mass the rate of

456
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,980
spin accelerated quickly and by the time

457
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,959
they re-entered Communications range

458
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,300
Neil Armstrong who you may recognize

459
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,339
from his later work like being the first

460
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,380
person to walk on the moon

461
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,959
reported that we're rolling up and we

462
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,180
can't turn anything off

463
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,160
as the spin rate became faster and

464
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,380
faster the astronaut's Vision got blurry

465
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,959
so they couldn't read their instruments

466
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,060
and Armstrong turned off the entire

467
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,440
system that seemed to be causing the

468
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,480
problem instead using the re-entry

469
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,160
control system thrusters to regain

470
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,019
command of Gemini 8 and stop the

471
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,100
spinning

472
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,019
because the new Chief flight director

473
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,120
John Hodge knew that Armstrong had used

474
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
nearly 75 percent of the re-entry

475
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,560
maneuvering propellant stopping this he

476
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,880
had to make the hard decision to bring

477
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,440
the crew home without pursuing remaining

478
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,779
mission objectives this was because too

479
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,639
many backup plans had been used up at

480
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,620
this point for adequate resiliency to

481
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,660
continue work on that mission

482
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,279
even though the mission objectives

483
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,100
weren't entirely achieved I do consider

484
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,420
this an overall successful Mission

485
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,040
because they achieved their primary

486
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,500
objective and importantly the entire

487
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,660
team made it home safely we have later

488
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,160
work we can talk about from them

489
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,779
the Gemini 10 Mission leader that year

490
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,579
was able to Rendezvous with the agina

491
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:03,660
and complete some of the remaining

492
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,299
objectives as well because of this issue

493
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,339
astronauts were given an additional

494
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,319
switch in future versions of Gemini

495
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,119
spacecraft so they could turn off the

496
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,619
individual elements of systems that

497
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,660
weren't working properly thereby adding

498
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,520
that extra layer of resilience that they

499
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,500
would have needed

500
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,380
this team needed business continuity for

501
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,119
their business continuity

502
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,760
if NASA had settled for one or two or

503
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,559
maybe even three layers of backup plans

504
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,360
and considered things handled this

505
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,040
incident could have prevented Gemini 8

506
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,360
from successfully confirming their

507
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,340
docking and could even have resulted in

508
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,480
loss of life

509
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,039
fortunately they were looking at the

510
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,660
systems level and also at the people who

511
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,039
needed to be involved in the processes

512
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,900
and the effects of those people as

513
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,700
humans and their tools as Technologies

514
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,799
so of course there were unexpected

515
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,720
behaviors that could without adequate

516
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,100
planning and redundancy create

517
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,200
significant risks to the mission and the

518
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,260
astronauts involved in it and the use of

519
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,880
some of those backup systems like the

520
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,500
thrusters caused others to be more

521
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,960
likely to fail but they had plans for

522
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,140
this

523
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,980
I'm going to ask everybody to reflect

524
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,960
right now on where your organization

525
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,880
might need more support to ensure that

526
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,440
your business continuity plan can be

527
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,419
followed when it needs to

528
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:14,340
how many people can go out of the office

529
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,620
at a single time before some of your

530
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,660
core processes become unstable or

531
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,280
impossible

532
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,559
how many of those people live on the

533
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,900
same fault line or use the same internet

534
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,360
provider or have the same electrical

535
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,559
grid

536
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,559
have you adjusted the base rates for the

537
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,059
likelihood of disasters in your current

538
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,740
environment while living in a pandemic

539
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,360
and working probably more remote than

540
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,899
you're used to

541
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,299
is this still you I see entirely too

542
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,640
many of these note that date this is a

543
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,380
pretty nice template however templates

544
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,059
don't need to be updated quite as often

545
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,220
as actual policies so while it's fine

546
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,480
that this template version of the

547
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,980
document hasn't been updated since March

548
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,799
2020 it is not fine if yours hasn't we

549
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,360
have learned so much and hopefully your

550
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,740
business processes have been adjusted

551
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,179
accordingly but many organizations

552
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,860
haven't taken advantage of that new

553
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,600
knowledge to improve policies and

554
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
processes you've got to adapt those to

555
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,740
your current business environment

556
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,140
off my soapbox other than keeping your

557
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,120
policies and procedures up to date what

558
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,700
can you do about this

559
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
some of you may already be familiar with

560
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,260
taichiono's concept of the five wise as

561
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,760
used in evaluating business process

562
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,160
failures when something goes wrong you

563
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,539
should try to find why it went wrong

564
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,520
then why that happened and why that

565
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,140
happened and when you've asked why five

566
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,940
times you're at the root cause or at

567
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,799
least close enough to it that that is

568
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:34,200
where you should try to fix it NASA

569
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,880
similarly analyzes failures beyond the

570
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,380
first tier and even on much earlier

571
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,940
missions like we talked about way back

572
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,280
in that first overview slide had people

573
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,080
like Katherine Johnson calculating extra

574
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,840
backup plans we don't always do that as

575
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,240
well in Tech though what if instead of

576
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,620
waiting for something to go wrong you

577
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,120
not only look forward but also for

578
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,100
overlaps if there's a fire at the office

579
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,840
which potential disasters or instance

580
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,360
become more likely which incidents

581
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,520
become more severe if they do occur do

582
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,840
any of these increase the risk of

583
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,240
burnout among your team in ways that you

584
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,640
need to plan for long-term recovery on a

585
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,200
human level

586
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,820
think through in advance how a certain

587
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,200
scenario may impact the resources

588
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,460
available to you to respond to other

589
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,440
concurrent scenarios for example coming

590
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,580
back to that currently common one

591
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,460
disease outbreak you've normally got all

592
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,320
of these resources ready but when you

593
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,700
experience a disease outbreak that

594
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,020
affects chunks of your organization

595
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,299
maybe you lose access to a bunch of your

596
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,160
export resources because they attended a

597
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,020
party together and they all got sick you

598
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,400
can't go to your backup office locations

599
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,840
because some of your team are contagious

600
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,580
your cross-trained backup people are not

601
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,380
able to work either the people with the

602
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,120
pr training and the people who can

603
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,580
provide more are all out sick some of

604
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,020
your policies and procedures are still

605
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,580
fine but lots of them have references to

606
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,960
specific people you're supposed to ask

607
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,400
questions and those people are not at

608
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,660
work either

609
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,460
I miss when this sounded like a Sci-Fi

610
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,480
scenario I bet lots of you do too

611
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,980
unfortunately I have seen this happen at

612
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,480
multiple companies I either worked for

613
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,340
or alongside within the last few years

614
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,440
and this is only one of the several ways

615
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,360
that BCP execution needs to allow for

616
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,039
multiple kinds of crisis at once

617
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,240
keep in mind though that I am not

618
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,679
expecting any of you to work in our

619
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,539
imaginary ideal organization your

620
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:12,299
organizational resources will vary and

621
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,160
it's important to look at which things

622
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,200
you can do as scale to your organization

623
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,600
and its resources human factors increase

624
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,039
the risk but also the Ingenuity

625
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,480
available once you get stuck in these

626
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,700
situations Neil Armstrong's use of those

627
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,620
thrusters was not an anticipated backup

628
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,260
plan but it did save lives

629
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,059
you can also take advantage of human

630
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,740
creativity and curiosity earlier on in

631
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,840
the planning process and let people have

632
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
fun with exploring what could possibly

633
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,200
go wrong the best thing you can do for

634
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,580
disaster preparedness if you work at a

635
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,840
company is to create a safe environment

636
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,860
for your employees so they feel

637
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,240
confident communicating early and often

638
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,220
about problems like these and remember

639
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,960
that you're all in it together if you

640
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,280
don't work at a company either because

641
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,659
you're a student or just doing your own

642
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,280
thing you might think about how the same

643
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,600
type of planning principles can be

644
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,679
applied to things like your earthquake

645
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,480
Readiness kit or your camping plans or

646
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,100
what you take to a conference to make

647
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,440
your life smoother in other areas I will

648
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,120
be taking questions in the hallway not

649
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,039
here and I look forward to seeing

650
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:05,539
several of you out there thank you
