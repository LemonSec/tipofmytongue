1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,940
hello everyone thank you for joining us

00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,460
this afternoon we are delighted to have

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,379
Tanya Sims and Lauren Williams to talk

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,480
to us about space and cyberspace at the

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,780
White House

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,759
thank you so much for that introduction

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,460
um I guess first off welcome back from

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,020
lunch

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,240
um these seats are very comfortable so

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,960
feel free to recline back and listen to

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,080
us drone on about policy

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,119
um yeah very exciting I got a woo

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,380
somewhere

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,140
um okay so uh first off um I guess a

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,820
round of introductions my name is Tanya

16
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,700
Sims I'm the director for cyber policy

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,200
and programs at the office of the

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,840
national cyber director over the course

19
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,379
of the last 12 years prior to oncd

20
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,559
um I was I've been in the National

21
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,680
Security Systems

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,719
cyber defense sort of community making

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,719
sure that our critical assets critical

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,100
for military operations for other uh

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,739
sensitive National Security missions are

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,500
well defended and protected and so I see

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,000
one of my former colleagues in the

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,680
audience there but I guess I shouldn't

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,180
point to him because he might have

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,260
issues with that um but uh anyways so um

31
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,240
at the office of the national cyber

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,439
director

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,200
um oh and CD as we like to call it

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,840
um uh my primary goal as a director for

35
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,240
cyber policy and programs is to look at

36
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,040
critical infrastructure related

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,979
governance right how is the federal

38
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:35,460
government Community organized and

39
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,500
um sort of around critical

40
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,500
infrastructure systems protections and

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,479
so you think about sort of all the

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,939
Departments and agencies uh dealing with

43
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,740
the 16 critical infrastructure sectors

44
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,780
that we have in this country

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,460
um that are called sector risk

46
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,439
management agencies right how are we

47
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,500
actually working as a cohesive unit to

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,479
properly defend the different sectors

49
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,479
from cyber related risks and

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,140
vulnerabilities attack but also how are

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,540
we talking about sort of private public

52
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,580
collaboration when it comes to critical

53
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,099
infrastructure systems cyber security as

54
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,920
we all know probably that um over the

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,200
course of the last 20 years critical

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
infrastructure is mostly within private

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,220
sector hands right right and so public

58
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,959
private collaboration in that sense is

59
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:24,360
very important and Space Systems while

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,239
not a critical infrastructure sector per

61
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,239
se formally designated as such we

62
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,680
recognize it to be a critical

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,239
underpinning function right when you

64
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,800
think about not just military

65
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,620
application but also sort of all of the

66
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,739
communications GPS right weather

67
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:43,739
monitoring that that we rely on

68
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,959
um in our daily lives is just average

69
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,019
civilians right Space Systems becomes

70
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,440
incredibly important and so these are

71
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,000
just some of the things that I focus on

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,099
within oncd Lauren

73
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,959
thanks so much Tanya I'm really glad to

74
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,540
be here with my colleague given all of

75
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,640
the Aries expertise that she's focused

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,860
on for for a long time I'm Lauren

77
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,420
Williams and I think we very much are

78
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,739
here to bring put the space in

79
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,420
cyberspace through this panel and this

80
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,800
conversation

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,140
um and I am a senior advisor for

82
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,400
strategy and research was in the office

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,400
of the national cyber director and have

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,080
been in this office for the better part

85
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,900
of this year but previously immediately

86
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,519
before coming to the White House was

87
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,260
working in the Department of Defense in

88
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,580
the office of the assistant secretary

89
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,580
for space policy which is I'm sure as

90
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,280
many of you know space policy

91
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
particularly within the government is

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,420
kind of a new a growing area an

93
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,760
expanding area of focus given all the

94
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,379
reasons that Tanya mentioned that's

95
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,420
because Space Systems are so critical to

96
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,280
way of life to National Security to our

97
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,659
economy and so I joined that that office

98
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,680
relatively immediately after the space

99
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,239
force was created lots of activity

100
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,459
around space issues within the

101
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,319
Department of Defense while I was there

102
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,420
I focused very particularly on kind of

103
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,620
the intersection thinking about the

104
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,959
intersection between National

105
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:01,980
securities-based missions and how we can

106
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,900
better leverage our Partnerships with

107
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,120
the private sector particularly many of

108
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,620
the companies that are based here in

109
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,180
California how can the Department of

110
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,260
Defense way on the other side of the

111
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,120
country be better integrated and

112
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,680
thinking about how the private sector

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,019
does things and incorporating that way

114
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,940
of thinking and systems and services

115
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,600
into how we do things back in DC and

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,100
since I joined the White House when I

117
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,600
walked in the door as the person who had

118
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,160
come immediately from from the

119
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,479
Department of Defense working on Space

120
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,000
issues this issue of space system cyber

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,320
security was one that had been

122
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,720
percolating it's one that Tanya had been

123
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,240
thinking about at the White House for

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,419
some time but it's one that needed kind

125
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,120
of further high level attention from our

126
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,580
perspective at the White House and so

127
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,340
we're here today to talk to you about

128
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,080
um I would say in the better part of the

129
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,479
past six months of effort on going

130
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,900
within our offices to lend more of that

131
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,780
high level next expertise and

132
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,900
invisibility to this issue

133
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,540
okay and with that maybe the next slide

134
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,419
so first off right

135
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,660
um a little bit more about the office of

136
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,699
the national cyber director how many of

137
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,479
you have heard of oncd just a oh there's

138
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,699
a lot of you okay well

139
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,280
um I will still do my spiel

140
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,860
Berg

141
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,500
and so um Owen CD right

142
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,139
um the newest sort of organization

143
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,780
policy organization at the White House

144
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,080
um I I'll just circle back right over

145
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,180
the last 40 years and that predates my

146
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,039
existence on this Earth but over the

147
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,900
last 40 years there's been sort of a

148
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,880
debate a discussion at the highest

149
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,740
levels in terms of how do we organize as

150
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,780
a US Government around cyber security as

151
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,139
the sort of thing that is not just you

152
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,479
know in the movie movie hackers as a

153
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,340
subculture right but as a as a critical

154
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,919
function that that underpins sort of

155
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,900
everything that we are doing

156
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,720
um and so there's this rapid Innovation

157
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,419
rapid sort of Market expansion and then

158
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,259
and also a growing rapid need for cyber

159
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:09,240
security and so

160
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,100
um there has been this debate but really

161
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,259
sort of I think no sort of central point

162
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,300
to say how do we actually do this how do

163
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,860
we actually create some accountability

164
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,340
in this space and so in 2019

165
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,520
um the uh Solarium commission

166
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,100
um stood up and sort of tried to examine

167
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,620
and how do we actually do this right and

168
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,080
what the commission found was that there

169
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,819
is a need that there is a gap to be

170
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,860
filled with the creation of a national

171
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,660
cyber director well first the commission

172
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,340
thought it was going to be a great idea

173
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,479
to maybe

174
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,000
create a new Department of cyber that

175
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,280
was scrapped pretty quick pretty quickly

176
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,520
right we we need more federal agencies

177
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,759
um but no so uh after sort of toying

178
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,740
with the idea of the creation of a

179
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,080
department of cyber they said well what

180
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,300
if we had sort of an organization at the

181
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,400
highest level at the White House

182
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,280
um who had the sort of a national cyber

183
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,400
director who had the convening authority

184
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,620
to to bring together public and private

185
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,960
stakeholders like never before right no

186
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,900
one truly has that Authority whether you

187
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,000
go to sort of a specific Federal agency

188
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,699
like sizza or NSA or whatever right not

189
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,580
one of them has sort of um an overall

190
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,979
convening authority over the entirety of

191
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,080
public and private and so this office

192
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,599
would be sort of stood up to first and

193
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,539
foremost have that convening Authority

194
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,160
and then

195
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,020
um the other point right

196
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,240
um is that

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,180
um Congress agreed with that assessment

198
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,039
surprisingly so

199
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:41,940
um

200
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,699
in uh 2021 the National Defense

201
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:47,460
authorization Act of fiscal year 2021

202
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,120
actually called for the stand-up of this

203
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,520
position the national cyber director and

204
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,120
so in June of 2021

205
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,039
um Chris Inglis so many of you might

206
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,419
have known him

207
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,699
um former deputy director of NSA and

208
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,580
also fighter pilot extraordinaire

209
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,880
um he was actually sworn in uh sorry

210
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,819
confirmed by the Senate to be the

211
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,860
nation's first cyber director and in

212
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,440
July he was actually sworn in but he was

213
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,240
employee number one so we like to call

214
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,300
ourselves a startup of the White House

215
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,220
um

216
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,080
for all that who have worked in federal

217
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,819
government that is

218
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,819
um it's it's both fun and interesting

219
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,740
and daily excitement right but uh as

220
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,659
employee number one right he had the

221
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,240
hard task of right-sizing the

222
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,399
organization because he can't obviously

223
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,159
cannot do it all so over the course of

224
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,380
the last year we've grown to 80 people

225
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,220
strong within oncd and I would say it's

226
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,399
still growing right and we have people

227
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,459
like myself and Lauren and others from

228
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,820
um sort of private and public sectors to

229
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,260
bring their background and experiences

230
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,019
to bear in onc and

231
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,600
um what is really our mission so our

232
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,080
mission right one is that public and

233
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,580
private partnership what does that

234
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,019
actually mean right we've talked about

235
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,160
it and talked about it and talked about

236
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,860
it over you know decades and decades but

237
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,360
how do you actually bring that to bear

238
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,040
what do you do to bring some

239
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,580
accountability to that second is federal

240
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,800
coherence who is actually doing what in

241
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,959
the federal sphere right if you're going

242
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,480
to reach out to or if you have a concern

243
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
about a cyber security risk or

244
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,540
vulnerability who do you reach out to

245
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,580
you shouldn't write

246
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,980
um you just have to Google it right you

247
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,779
should have a roster of candidates at

248
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,580
your disposal to reach out to for

249
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,380
additional information and to be

250
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,060
connected to the right people right you

251
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,680
don't want to just be constantly

252
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,720
searching and searching and searching

253
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,600
um third is increasing future resilience

254
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,279
right cyber security isn't something to

255
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,620
just sprinkle in after the fact after

256
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,740
you know a cyber 911 type of event right

257
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,620
you want to we want to consider a

258
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,019
culture where it's cyber security by

259
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,120
Design so that we are increasing the

260
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,580
security and resiliency of products that

261
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,980
everyday citizens use whether that's you

262
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,160
know your your grandparents or also your

263
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,920
children or the businesses and the

264
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,500
organizations that you support right

265
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,899
um we want those products to be secure

266
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,779
by Design and then fourth is aligning

267
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,700
resources to aspirations

268
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,880
um very very important which I think is

269
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,440
um a little bit different from maybe

270
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,000
some of the other organizations that

271
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,800
have been stood up at the White House

272
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,260
level where this one is especially when

273
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,700
we're talking about cyber security cyber

274
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,160
security can be expensive right and

275
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,380
maybe not all the different

276
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,000
organizations that we're talking to have

277
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
the resources to actually do the things

278
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,339
that that we are asking of them and so

279
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,019
how do we align that there's a specific

280
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,480
team within oncd looking at budget right

281
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,279
looking at and talking to different

282
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,440
organizations to make sure that we can

283
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,680
have those resources that align to what

284
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,959
we are talking about and that gets into

285
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,140
sort of implementing and talking about a

286
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,459
national cyber security strategy

287
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,540
all right so I think that's a great

288
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,480
lead-in to again our very new

289
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,839
organization just showed up in 2021

290
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,360
um just very much now uh reaching its

291
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,220
full strength and uh kind of thinking

292
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,019
about the full breadth and range of

293
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,700
activities that an office of the

294
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,260
national cyber director should be

295
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,880
undertaking for the purpose of

296
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,320
increasing security and resilience

297
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,019
across the digital ecosystem and so it's

298
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,459
been it's been very busy and as Tanya

299
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,320
mentioned it's been an exciting time

300
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,079
um and not least because in just last

301
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,380
month early in March 2023 the Biden

302
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,300
Harris Administration released a

303
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,399
national cyber security strategy and as

304
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,899
I'm sure many of you know this was the

305
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,640
first cyber security site the first

306
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,140
cyber security strategy but the first

307
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,839
cyber strategy uh released within the

308
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,519
last five years and for this

309
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,560
Administration

310
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,240
and this strategy is very much focused

311
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,860
on what we like to call an affirmative

312
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,660
vision for cyberspace an affirmative

313
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,120
vision for a digital ecosystem that is

314
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,920
different from from previous versions

315
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,959
previous iterations of cyber strategies

316
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,459
because it's not one that's focused on

317
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,079
the threat actors it's not one that's

318
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,820
focused on you know what we need to do

319
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,700
to um what we need to do to defend

320
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,260
ourselves from threat actors primarily

321
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,300
but also to think about how we can be

322
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,079
better using cyberspace to enable all of

323
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,940
the things that are important to us as

324
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,920
Citizens and across National Security

325
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,260
and kind of economic implications and so

326
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,839
kind of the key underlying principles

327
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,880
are that you know cyberspace exists to

328
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,680
help us achieve our goals it should be

329
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,079
an enabler not an impediment the end

330
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,579
state that we're seeking is a digital

331
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,279
ecosystem in which it enables civil

332
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,440
society and defense and National

333
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,279
Security as well as cooperation in

334
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,160
advanced areas like space

335
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,660
um and so the key fundamental shifts

336
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,519
that are important to highlight are are

337
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,500
the ones that are listed on on this side

338
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,139
of the the slide here and they are one

339
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,300
kind of the primary uh fundamental shift

340
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,740
uh that has been getting a lot of

341
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,800
attention is this Focus um now within

342
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,600
this Administration to Shifting the

343
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,420
burden of responsibility from the actors

344
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,040
that are most vulnerable that are at

345
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,820
least

346
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,700
um least able to handle it to those who

347
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,579
are most enabled and most empowered uh

348
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,860
to be able to make the changes that can

349
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,300
have Ripple effects across the digital

350
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,100
ecosystem so very specifically we're

351
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,839
talking about government we're talking

352
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,639
about bigger companies that should have

353
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,019
more of the burden of responsibility

354
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,139
than for example our grandparents or us

355
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,940
as individual citizens who have been

356
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,320
told you know just change your passwords

357
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,540
or do XYZ and and then

358
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,860
um you know you will you yourselves will

359
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,540
be will be protected those things are

360
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,160
all important but there's also a bigger

361
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,779
conversation to be had about where the

362
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,700
burden of responsibility should lie so

363
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,079
that is fundamental shift number one

364
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,380
number two uh to Tanya's Point earlier

365
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,240
as well focusing on implementation and

366
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,980
thinking about what should be done kind

367
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,459
of realign incentives there's a focus in

368
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,560
this strategy on realigning incentives

369
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,440
to favor our longer term aspirations and

370
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,019
Investments the strategy itself is

371
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:09,120
organized around five critical pillars

372
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,360
which are listed on this side defending

373
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,920
critical infrastructure and disrupting

374
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,380
and dismantling threat actors shaping

375
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,880
Market forces to drive security and

376
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,680
resilience investing in a resilient

377
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,440
future and finally for and last but not

378
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,120
least finally forging International

379
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,880
Partnerships what we would argue as we

380
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,680
we transition to talking more about

381
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,079
space cyber security is that the

382
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,139
national cyber security strategy and the

383
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,160
Five Pillars included in that strategy

384
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,720
are an opportunity they provide an

385
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,220
opportunity their policy it's a policy

386
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,899
document a strategic kind of high level

387
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:44,940
language but it provides an opportunity

388
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,820
for us as government and as a private

389
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,220
sector and across Society just apply

390
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,600
those principles to real world

391
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,940
challenges to real World threats that

392
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,180
are ongoing today and one area of

393
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,459
growing activity and growing Focus for

394
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:01,380
our office as well as other elements at

395
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,699
the the White House the National Space

396
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,560
Council National Security Council as

397
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,779
well is the important and Urgent issue

398
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,920
of space cyber security

399
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,579
foreign

400
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,820
all right so in particular the work that

401
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,339
we have been doing and thinking about

402
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,079
related to space system cyber security

403
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:21,839
very much is driven and motivated by the

404
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,240
existing policy and the law of the land

405
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,880
when it comes to space cyber security

406
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,920
and so this is very specifically space

407
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,899
policy directive five which was released

408
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,360
during the previous administration

409
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,839
um and it is good policy we would argue

410
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,560
um it is high level it it provides

411
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,980
General policy and five principles to

412
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,220
apply to the space ecosystem and kind of

413
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,279
stepping back for a moment uh the policy

414
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,279
is based on the the assessment and the

415
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,560
argument that you know Space Systems are

416
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,779
a critical and critical enabler of all

417
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,699
critical infrastructure those 16 sectors

418
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:01,680
that Tanya mentioned here on Earth and

419
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,839
so we don't just care about space for

420
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,360
space's sake or because it's cool we

421
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,519
which all of which is true but we care

422
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,660
about it because Space Systems they

423
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,240
satellites allow us to utilize GPS here

424
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,959
on the earth they enable Communications

425
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,040
more and more you know companies are

426
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,380
providing private sector companies are

427
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,540
providing space-based internet and

428
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,940
communication Services

429
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,339
you name it probably any daily activity

430
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:31,620
that you rely on also relies on on Space

431
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,600
Systems and so for that reason it's

432
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,459
incredibly incredibly important for us

433
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,339
to think about how we can better as

434
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,320
across private and public sector how we

435
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,480
can better ensure that space systems are

436
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,880
resilient to cyber threats and thinking

437
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,920
a little bit more uh thinking about the

438
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,680
threat environment it is I'm sure very

439
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,899
well known to all of you that in the

440
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,199
Ukraine Russia Ukraine context over a

441
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,300
year ago the very first shot we would

442
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,440
argue in that in that conflict was a

443
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,140
Cyber attack on a U.S U.S based space

444
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,480
system which had Ripple effects across

445
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,140
Europe and so they're very very real

446
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,179
threat and kind of urgent

447
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,179
urgent challenges to be addressed so go

448
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,980
ahead yeah no I just wanted to

449
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,740
underscore that last point right and so

450
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,020
during the Russia Ukraine conflict we

451
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,280
saw that

452
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,859
um space assets weren't just focused on

453
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,859
for sort of projecting military

454
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,360
operations or military might but

455
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,340
specifically when it came down to it the

456
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,080
impact to the civilians and the Dual

457
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,760
nature of space assets is what we're

458
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,039
talking about in terms of criticality

459
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,240
right

460
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,880
um Communications for you know phone

461
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,460
signals were disrupted but also access

462
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,679
to Internet for just people trying to go

463
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,840
about their daily lives and then the

464
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,760
other point is what we're talking about

465
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,200
when when you hear sort of thought

466
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,520
leaders talk about great power

467
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,260
competition

468
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,520
um and just you know great power

469
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,620
competition in in terms like that right

470
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,960
we think about Russia the the People's

471
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Republic of China right you think about

472
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,160
the doctrines that they have issued

473
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,320
which which highlight the importance of

474
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,120
space assets not just because of the

475
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,679
Dual nature but because of both the

476
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,660
economic Advantage

477
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,660
um in sort of peacetime as well as in

478
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,900
Wartime that military advantage and so

479
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,840
um space Assets in in in that respect

480
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,299
right remain incredibly important

481
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,280
um for us as a government

482
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,100
um but the issues with spd5 So

483
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,080
principally speaking the general

484
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,940
principles that are outlined here right

485
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,799
I think everybody can agree these make

486
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,660
sense they look good they sound good

487
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,940
they feel good but at the end of the day

488
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,640
we're lacking one a lot of technical

489
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,760
detail right we're lacking what what are

490
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,679
the steps to implementation what are

491
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,600
those some of the key features that

492
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,760
people can really grasp and say okay

493
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,280
this is how I'm going to prioritize my

494
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,679
cyber security in in working through

495
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,299
this issue

496
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,460
um and so those measures are sort of

497
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,080
missing right we don't have sort of

498
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,240
accountable parties even listed out in

499
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,799
the actual directive calling out

500
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,240
different government agencies for

501
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,799
example in terms of them having

502
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,900
accountability over certain aspects of

503
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,320
of what is presented in spd5 the other

504
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,360
point is that there is no enforcement

505
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,760
mechanism that in that sense

506
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,460
um it's policy not law and for the

507
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,900
lawyers out there right that distinction

508
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,600
is very very important it's not statute

509
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,240
right no one is required to do it it's

510
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,120
not a mandate and so um in that sense

511
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,320
right

512
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,660
if there's no implementation details

513
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,240
right and there's no nobody's sort of

514
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,039
cracking the Whip or not even cracking

515
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,500
or providing a very soft carrot right to

516
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,020
say like Please do this right

517
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,679
um

518
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,679
then who's actually tracking progress

519
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,419
um when it comes to a space system cyber

520
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,679
security

521
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,380
um and so with with solarwinds I think

522
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,539
we saw a lot of the challenges

523
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,400
associated with supply chain security

524
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,559
but also first and foremost it was an

525
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,900
issue with information sharing and truly

526
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,880
understanding what resides um within

527
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,059
your software product and so something

528
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,520
like spd5 right what we're saying is

529
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,320
well let's take these basic principles

530
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,900
and let's add some teeth to it but also

531
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,600
let's let's provide some technical

532
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,360
details where we can get at things like

533
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,200
soft uh supply chain security

534
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,000
absolutely and then the other element

535
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
that is really that is critical and it

536
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,620
also uh very much fits into our ethos as

537
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,900
an organization is that as we all know

538
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,660
uh the private sector is very much kind

539
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,160
of driving the pace of innovation when

540
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,260
it comes to thinking about the growth of

541
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,600
the space economy and all of the

542
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,299
Innovations across the the ecosystem of

543
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,500
Space Systems so we're talking about

544
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,960
launch and Commercial imagery satellite

545
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,299
Communications cloud and data

546
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,799
infrastructure the private sector is

547
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,480
very much on the Leading Edge of

548
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,020
innovation and so we as oncd with a very

549
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,340
much a focus on public-private

550
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,799
collaboration and our partners within

551
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,600
the White House would agree

552
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,880
um very much see the the importance of

553
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,200
especially even in just you know the

554
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,960
past three years when uh since spd5 was

555
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,940
released very much see the importance of

556
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,039
Leaning into understanding perspectives

557
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,900
from the White House sorry perspectives

558
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,539
from industry and how those can be taken

559
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:17,520
back to the White House and better used

560
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,440
to be to inform

561
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,419
um further kind of Developmental policy

562
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:23,820
and again to the point of implementation

563
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,280
even when it comes to the National cyber

564
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,460
security strategy oncd has already begun

565
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,559
focusing on implementation plan because

566
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,539
implementation is really where policy

567
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,659
hits the road and so we see space cyber

568
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,840
security as another very important area

569
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,419
in which to apply uh that prioritization

570
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,880
of you know policy is needed but

571
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,960
implementation is really where the

572
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,000
rubber hits the road yeah and there's

573
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,980
also been of some other policies that

574
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,260
have come out since then um right in May

575
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,220
2021 there was executive order 14028

576
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,539
um improving the nation's cyber security

577
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:00,240
which really put a spotlight on the need

578
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,760
for better critical or better sort of

579
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,220
processes guidelines procedures when it

580
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,559
came to critical infrastructure related

581
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,299
systems and assets as well as those in

582
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,740
the federal government

583
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,440
um right you had things in there to call

584
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,020
out specific

585
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,600
principles and sort of requirements for

586
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,260
federal agencies to look at zero trust

587
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,080
to look at uh different sort of better

588
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,059
encryption right multi-factor

589
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,100
authentication things like that that are

590
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,039
I think pretty you know well maybe aside

591
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,659
from zero trust but the other ones right

592
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:34,919
probably things that you have heard

593
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,900
again and again and again but those are

594
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,140
things where when it becomes policy or

595
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,620
when you see that sort of reflected and

596
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,720
um in an executive order right you take

597
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,419
stock of that um but even with that

598
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:49,200
right

599
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,100
um it's how can that EO then be applied

600
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,820
or expand upon spd5 and I think it does

601
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,299
take it one step further but also it's

602
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,520
not directly relevant to Space Systems

603
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,919
right um it's not for Space Systems and

604
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,960
so people have to extrapolate and do an

605
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,120
extra layer of thinking so

606
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,580
um but also with the EO the question

607
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,620
becomes well who can offer some

608
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,559
coherence around the federal governments

609
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,140
and agencies trying to implement the

610
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,200
executive order and that's where sort of

611
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,659
um oncd comes in in terms of the mission

612
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,240
that we have the public private sort of

613
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,980
collaboration and the federal coherence

614
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,260
that we have to bring to bear right one

615
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,080
of the key things that we're we have

616
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,000
been driving since

617
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,360
um you know oncd standup is convening

618
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,360
executive level forums at the White

619
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,700
House to share sensitive information but

620
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,539
also to present it to to the c-suite

621
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,700
level leaders who if you deal with them

622
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,320
on a daily basis right they might not

623
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,940
understand the context for why you're

624
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,679
asking for additional Technical

625
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,960
Resources right and so trying to add

626
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,460
some context to the things that their

627
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,740
people might be already communicating to

628
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,900
them right and adding a level of urgency

629
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,059
to that those were some of the dialogues

630
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,100
that we have been trying to convene at

631
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,480
the White House so

632
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,820
um first was focused on energy sector

633
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,059
then we did I think healthcare Aviation

634
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,720
um the last one in December was on

635
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,940
electric vehicles

636
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,179
and most recently was the one at the um

637
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,980
focused on space

638
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,980
yes so just a few weeks ago

639
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,440
um as Tony mentioned oncd continued a

640
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,200
series of executive level forums

641
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,539
um with our most recent activity focused

642
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,640
on space system cyber security so this

643
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,039
was a really exciting event for for us

644
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,320
exciting activity um for us at the White

645
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,260
House we co-hosted our acting National

646
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,640
cyber director Kemba Walden in

647
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,440
particular co-hosted with National Space

648
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,059
Council executive secretary shirag

649
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,360
Parikh an executive forum on space at

650
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,320
the White House with 10 leading space

651
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
industry Executives at the c-suite level

652
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,299
along with a really uh really long list

653
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,760
of senior level U.S government officials

654
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,740
and I think what was really important

655
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,360
about the kind of just looking around

656
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,559
the room which you can you can see a

657
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,900
depiction of of here

658
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,000
um was that in the corner oh yeah we're

659
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,460
in the corner exactly right over there

660
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,820
we were very excited about that

661
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,799
um what this demonstrates is

662
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,559
demonstrated for us was the importance

663
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,500
of this particular issue area across the

664
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,960
private sector across government because

665
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,140
uh you know this this was a very tightly

666
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,760
held forum for the purpose of a Sunday

667
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,320
mentioned providing sensitive

668
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,820
information that may not otherwise you

669
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,260
know be able to be shared

670
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,000
um unless officials come to the White

671
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,140
House as well as to have a a small sort

672
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,419
of moderated discussion so those two two

673
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,240
elements formed the executive forum you

674
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,679
can't really have that if you have a

675
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,799
kind of a conference level a sort of

676
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,360
event and so we've scoped these very

677
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,760
tightly for the purpose of generating

678
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,279
conversation and we very much saw

679
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:04,020
um kind of across the board in the

680
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,700
conversations with industry Executives

681
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,200
and with the senior government leaders

682
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,960
how important they found this issue just

683
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,340
demonstrated by the fact that you know

684
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,960
these Executives flew across across the

685
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,640
country to the White House for a half

686
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,900
day event I think that very much

687
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,120
demonstrated to us how important this

688
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,400
issue was the opportunity for them them

689
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,779
to share our perspectives with each

690
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,580
other and to gain in real-time

691
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,159
information from senior officials like

692
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,840
uh you know our bosses we mentioned in

693
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,000
the National Space Council but NASA

694
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,440
administrator Bill Nelson was there as

695
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,020
well uh and Deputy Administrator deputy

696
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,960
secretary of Commerce Don Graves also

697
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,440
was an anchor of that event for us and

698
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,299
so it was a really critical sort of

699
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,640
launch I would say of the work that we

700
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,020
had been doing to gather perspectives

701
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,059
and to understand what are the critical

702
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,400
concerns that industry has and how can

703
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,860
bringing together like using the

704
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,059
convening power of the White House

705
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,880
really Galvanize

706
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,980
Galvanize activity related to space

707
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,380
system cyber security

708
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,600
yeah

709
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,880
all right so we wanted to share some of

710
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,039
the things that um were relayed during

711
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,440
that forum and so

712
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,980
um I think the key thing here to note is

713
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,120
that

714
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,299
um regardless of whether or or not we're

715
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:21,179
talking about sort of ground segments

716
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,340
the space segment or link segments right

717
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,159
we're saying essentially that

718
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,880
um if you have a space system right

719
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,520
um You can leverage terrestrial sort of

720
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,260
traditional cyber security best

721
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,419
practices as well Concepts and

722
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:37,980
principles in sort of your daily

723
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,039
operations and that's I think really

724
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,539
important right we're not just saying

725
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:44,460
that space systems are this you know

726
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,799
unique bin of

727
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,020
um set of challenges though we do

728
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,539
recognize that there are sort of some

729
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,299
very complex nuances to Space Systems

730
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,940
but for in generally speaking right

731
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,620
there are a lot of sort of basic cyber

732
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,600
security principles that we use for

733
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,760
terrestrial networks that can be applied

734
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,220
to Space Systems cyber security

735
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,779
um and so

736
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:09,960
the main risks out that we see right one

737
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,340
is

738
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,860
um not being secure by Design so when

739
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,740
when we talk about space assets and

740
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,360
being launched into orbit I think

741
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,880
there's a general recognition that it's

742
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,760
incredibly it would be incredibly harder

743
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,419
to apply cyber security mitigations to

744
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,299
something that is vulnerable than in

745
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,419
orbit and so what we're saying is

746
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,640
harping again on secure by Design secure

747
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,400
by Design right we're not talking about

748
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,480
um trying to do something after launch

749
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,580
right we're saying before that actually

750
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,860
takes place in your r d phase think

751
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,760
about better ways to to have cyber

752
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,620
security based on some of the policies

753
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,240
that have been out there based on some

754
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,039
of the best practices that already exist

755
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,880
in that ecosystem two is also not being

756
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,740
Innovative in silos right so what we're

757
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,600
talking about is

758
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,000
um getting away from that culture of

759
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,340
sort of being first to Market but secure

760
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,559
to Market and that's something where I

761
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,900
think it's very much a distinct call out

762
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,520
in the National cyber security strategy

763
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,559
right it's that push for Innovation

764
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,080
should shouldn't be sort of segregated

765
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,059
from the fact that you want to also have

766
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,919
a secure product and that's something

767
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,260
where um that's that's something that

768
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,320
we're trying to footstomp with people at

769
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,299
all levels of sort of the cyber security

770
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,880
ecosystem and then third is

771
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,740
um not ignoring sort of incidents that

772
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,419
have occurred in other sectors right we

773
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,039
talk about Colonial we talk about solar

774
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,299
winds

775
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,520
um even uh some of the things that have

776
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,500
affected sort of the food and AG sector

777
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,779
right those incidents shouldn't be

778
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,880
viewed as something that is Irrelevant

779
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,279
for the Space Systems Community there

780
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,600
are a lot of good Lessons Learned

781
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,399
whether it's from better information

782
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:55,620
sharing practices or better risk

783
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,240
management related approaches right

784
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,980
those things are are the things that can

785
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,419
be applied as well for the space system

786
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:01,440
community

787
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,179
yeah and one point I want to emphasize

788
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:05,100
particularly on that that second element

789
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,840
there um talking about you know

790
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,820
integrating cyber security into how we

791
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,700
think about Space Systems one of the

792
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,620
fundamental learnings uh for us along

793
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,600
this process and I think it's it's very

794
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,500
uh it could be could be apparent but um

795
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,940
it's been really really critical to how

796
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,399
we think about communication is that um

797
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,799
in government and I think as well in the

798
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,779
private sector even within the

799
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,820
communities of space and cyber security

800
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,980
space and cyber communities there was

801
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,080
not always that overlap in terms of even

802
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,460
common terminology of common

803
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,340
understanding they are two very distinct

804
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,580
and very technical areas but even across

805
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,200
those two there isn't always the

806
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,460
communication that would allow for

807
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,140
thinking holistically about spaces and

808
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,940
cyber security and so even just

809
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,340
physically by bringing together

810
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,679
stakeholders from those two communities

811
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,059
I come from the space Community Tanya

812
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,080
has spent more time in the cyber

813
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,480
community across our team making sure

814
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,860
that we're we're thinking about ways to

815
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,120
communicate that's been a really

816
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,220
critical finding for us and so we hope

817
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,679
to continue to convene thinking about

818
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,659
bringing those two communities together

819
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,940
yeah so the next slide

820
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,799
um just more generally

821
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,440
or actually more specifically cyber

822
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,980
threats to Space Systems and so we talk

823
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,860
through the ground segment

824
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,860
um the space segment and then more

825
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,679
generally what should be done so

826
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,779
um there's a lot of words I think on

827
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:28,799
this slide

828
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,419
um but really what we're trying to get

829
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,080
at is the it's I think

830
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,140
um an incredibly frustrating but all too

831
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,980
sort of familiar position to be in where

832
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,159
we realize sort of where our weakest

833
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,659
vulnerabilities or unpatched

834
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:48,320
vulnerabilities are after they have been

835
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,820
exploited by an adversary right whether

836
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,679
that's a nation state adversary whether

837
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,720
or not that's a cyber criminal these are

838
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,399
the things that we find out only after

839
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,899
the fact and what we're trying to get at

840
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,659
here is you should know what resides on

841
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:02,100
your network you should know what was

842
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,960
what you know all of the different

843
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,020
endpoints that you have you should know

844
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,580
where your weakest sort of

845
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,159
vulnerabilities are

846
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,500
before the adversary so when

847
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,720
um you know the adversary decides to

848
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,720
take out a certain critical node in a

849
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,159
critical infrastructure sector whether

850
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,559
that's a pipeline whether that's a

851
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,500
Waterway a railway whatever if they know

852
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,480
the critical node before you actually

853
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,100
know it we're always going to be playing

854
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,380
catch-up right and so that's the sort of

855
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,360
cyber 911 that I'm talking about where

856
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,840
there's the adversary knows the state of

857
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,940
our critical infrastructure perhaps in a

858
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,559
way that we don't even know ourselves

859
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,840
and that's something that I think we

860
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,820
can't afford to be in and that's a

861
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,080
culture shift right that's a culture

862
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,840
shift of better understanding your

863
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,360
network be being vigilant in doing those

864
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,360
vulnerability risk assessments having a

865
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,399
cyber security plan that actually maps

866
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,500
that out and being cognizant and and

867
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,140
persistent in sort of conducting those

868
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,480
risk assessments and so this is sort of

869
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,100
just some general things that we shared

870
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,679
with the CEOs and I don't think that any

871
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,360
of this is gonna

872
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,340
surprise or Scare any of you in the room

873
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,159
right but this is I think generally some

874
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,419
of the things that I think would be

875
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,580
useful for you to note that we relate to

876
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,000
those CEOs so that when you are having

877
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,039
um conversations about what you need and

878
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,720
how you need to do them the resources

879
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,519
that you need it should be sort of

880
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,159
Fairly easier right an easier

881
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:32,340
conversation to have in a much more

882
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,039
um a one where it's going to be more

883
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,779
productive

884
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:38,640
absolutely

885
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,740
all right

886
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,559
okay the question that we got from the

887
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,600
executives were um where can we find

888
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,360
additional information right and so the

889
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,100
thing to note here is that the federal

890
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,580
government has issued or has attempted

891
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,440
to sort of

892
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,620
um provide as much information as as as

893
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,740
as as possible to the broader public not

894
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,419
just for the national security systems

895
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,220
Community but for you know people

896
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,339
working in all sectors to say here are

897
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,820
some of the common the used ttps that

898
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,199
these different threat actors that we

899
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,659
are concerned about are using and how

900
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,918
they're doing it and here are some

901
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,080
mitigation steps right and so

902
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,760
um there are a couple that to highlight

903
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,199
again there's a lot of words I don't

904
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,580
expect you to read them but there's the

905
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,320
website there um it's NSA also sizza has

906
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,020
um their own sort of Library as well but

907
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,820
they're complementary

908
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,940
um NSA says uh even FBI and some of the

909
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,060
isacs have partnered a lot over the

910
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,879
course of the years to um provide some

911
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,139
context for some of the things that

912
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,599
they're talking about and how this

913
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,139
relates to Space Systems these are some

914
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,599
of the ones that that were presented to

915
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,599
the CEOs but also you know when we talk

916
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:58,940
about resets right um how visat is is

917
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,580
sort of that integral layer to

918
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,800
communication communicating from a space

919
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,480
asset to

920
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,859
um you know a ship related asset or some

921
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,980
aircraft right those vsat terminals are

922
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,839
going to be incredibly important but

923
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,420
also very vulnerable to Cyber attack and

924
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,460
here are some specific ways to mitigate

925
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,859
this one's talk talking about rmm

926
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,720
software and how adversaries are

927
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,880
exploiting that to gain persistence on

928
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,920
specific networks

929
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,780
um and then the last one there to

930
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,720
highlight is just commonly used or

931
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,260
commonly exploited cpes by

932
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,579
PRC threat actors

933
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:41,280
yeah and one of the again to the the

934
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,960
overarching point I think we would

935
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,339
definitely like to want to make and want

936
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,800
to leave with with all of you uh is that

937
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,380
there are resources obviously that exist

938
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,520
um that are being pushed out on a

939
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,260
regular basis by by agencies like the

940
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,000
National Security Agency like the

941
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,040
Department of Homeland Security but we

942
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,060
also understand

943
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,900
um this is something that you know

944
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,820
government needs to do better is to

945
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,980
share and make sure that the private

946
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,200
sector is aware and is receiving that

947
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,700
information and again knows who to come

948
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,619
to and no Sue to call so threat

949
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,060
information sharing especially in the

950
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,280
context of space cyber security which

951
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,859
again historically has been a relatively

952
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:17,839
kind of over classified area of a study

953
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,339
there are ways existing there are

954
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:21,660
existing ways and there are ways to

955
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,339
improve information sharing from from

956
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:24,540
public to private sector and that's very

957
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,520
much an element and a key priority of

958
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,180
the work that we're doing

959
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,220
and further to that work so we have

960
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,680
obviously held a forum at the senior

961
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,599
executive level and it was limited in

962
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,660
scope and tightly uh tightly scoped for

963
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,520
for a reason which was to to generate

964
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,800
kind of safe conversation among

965
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,500
Executives at that level which uh to

966
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,320
then uh to kind of ensure that they are

967
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,119
thinking about cyber security more

968
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,839
holistically and have informed views

969
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,460
that are informed by more sensitive

970
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,800
information and and takeaways to take

971
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,200
back to their companies and Implement up

972
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,420
and down the chain but the the next

973
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,280
critical step for us

974
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,440
um that was the clear from the start was

975
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,119
not only to have those kind of high

976
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,140
level

977
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,660
um uh sorts of events but to immediately

978
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,460
take the conversation following that

979
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,740
executive level Forum down to the

980
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,020
technical level and so we are here in

981
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,300
California this week Tanya and I are are

982
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,500
going to be convening a group of uh

983
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,560
space industry representatives from the

984
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,540
the West Coast from California yeah and

985
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,780
kind of surrounding areas for the first

986
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,579
stop on what we are calling an industry

987
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:38,220
Road Show and so as you can see here we

988
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,040
have a busy spring and summer ahead of

989
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,040
us and the purpose of this of this road

990
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,280
show is to one for us to get out of our

991
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,560
comfort zone to get out of Washington DC

992
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,720
and to go to the hubs of space industry

993
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,119
and to very much be in a listening

994
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,040
posture

995
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,680
we want to hear what the current kind of

996
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,720
state of play is across across companies

997
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,180
and how they're thinking about across

998
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,200
space companies how they're thinking

999
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,000
about tackling cyber threats and the way

1000
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,859
to do that we understand we very much

1001
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,440
understand is by going to where industry

1002
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,079
is is based and we want to have some

1003
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,940
geographical representation geographical

1004
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,220
diversity in terms of the conversations

1005
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,780
that we're holding and so we will we

1006
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,960
will be across the country and um again

1007
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,300
in California and Colorado and Texas and

1008
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,160
Florida in the northern Virginia area

1009
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,339
and maybe others as seem necessary in

1010
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,380
order to to gain that holistic set of

1011
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,619
perspectives and all for the purpose of

1012
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,300
Gathering perspectives from the private

1013
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,579
sector having parallel conversations in

1014
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,820
government thinking about how government

1015
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,140
owned and operated Space Systems can be

1016
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,540
better secured and better more resilient

1017
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,520
to cyber threats and taking that whole

1018
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,320
body of information and feeding it back

1019
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,420
into the policy process as we think

1020
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,640
about from the White House level what

1021
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,320
should be done what should be built upon

1022
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,440
from uh built on the existing policy

1023
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,560
dating back to 2020 recognizing that the

1024
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,359
the pace of Industry Innovation and the

1025
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,000
pace of development the space economy is

1026
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,520
moving really quickly so that's the

1027
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,099
overarching perspective and and plan

1028
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:14,160
ahead for us at oncd in partnership with

1029
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,900
the National Space Council in a

1030
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,640
partnership with with other federal

1031
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,680
government partners

1032
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,800
yeah I think it's it's really important

1033
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,900
for us to do this because

1034
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,599
um as we sort of have been saying

1035
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,400
throughout this whole talk right policy

1036
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,140
is only as good as its implementation

1037
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,680
and for us it's listening to the actual

1038
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,079
key stakeholders not just at the c-suite

1039
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:39,180
level right but um the people who are

1040
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,400
The Operators and the actual sort of

1041
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,720
developers

1042
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,760
um that level right hearing from them in

1043
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,980
terms of does this actually apply to you

1044
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,079
or how are you thinking through

1045
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:50,400
um some of the things that that you're

1046
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,740
being presented with in policy

1047
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,260
um and and having sort of a dialogue

1048
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,300
around that that's how we are viewing

1049
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,619
sort of

1050
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:01,800
um this Roadshow hosting these workshops

1051
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,079
to really try to get at

1052
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,380
um sort of that technical Workforce

1053
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,540
all right and so last but not least this

1054
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,300
is this is a representation of

1055
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,339
um Federal cohesion and kind of a whole

1056
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:16,920
of government uh sort of approach that

1057
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,460
we are taking uh into this work on Space

1058
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,859
cyber security because it can't just be

1059
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:24,839
a White House driven initiative even

1060
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,480
though we have heard and listened to the

1061
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,339
fact that it does require

1062
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,500
um you know to tackle a threat like the

1063
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,940
chocolate challenge like this it does

1064
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,640
require senior level attention which we

1065
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,160
have tried to generate through convening

1066
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,099
but it very much does require a Litany

1067
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:44,220
of departments and agencies I won't list

1068
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,220
all of them in specificity here but you

1069
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,060
know

1070
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,460
yes their logos are big um so you can

1071
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,400
see that we are we engaged in a lot of a

1072
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,680
conversation across uh departments and

1073
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,900
agencies and uh are moving forward on

1074
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,579
this work in Partnership

1075
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:01,500
um with all of them yeah and I think I

1076
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,940
just wanted to call out right a lot of

1077
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,460
government agencies are already doing or

1078
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,720
um you know trying to be thought leaders

1079
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,420
in this space no pun intended already

1080
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,720
um so sizza developed the uh cyber

1081
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,460
security performance goals which are

1082
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,960
meant for staying a local but it could

1083
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,740
also be applied for uh to sort of um

1084
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,880
different sectors of industry and so

1085
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,619
um the question is how right and that's

1086
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:26,940
the conversation that we want to have

1087
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,880
nist has done or just closed sort of

1088
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,339
their public commentary period for

1089
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:35,220
um uh 8270 which is on on the cyber

1090
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,839
security of commercial satellites right

1091
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:39,240
but um what does that final thing look

1092
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,020
like

1093
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,720
um final report look like and how does

1094
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,540
the community view implementation right

1095
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,040
that's that's kind of what we're trying

1096
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,560
to get at soza and the FBI are also

1097
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,980
convening public-private sector sort of

1098
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,900
workshops as well

1099
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,359
um which we hope to that will be very

1100
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,760
complementary with some of the efforts

1101
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,960
that we're talking about at a broader

1102
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,720
scale and so we're really excited about

1103
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,060
this road show and really happy to be

1104
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,160
here to tell you all about it so I think

1105
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,579
we have some time for questions

1106
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:13,859
eight minutes

1107
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:16,740
so your Roadshow your uh you're very

1108
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,240
space oriented because that's your point

1109
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,740
but you're also going to be seen as a

1110
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,780
cyber industry and you assume the space

1111
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,220
industry knows enough about cyber

1112
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,420
anything else

1113
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,420
with cyber hap or only

1114
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,099
yeah it's a great question

1115
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:35,280
um I would say uh well so very much we

1116
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,260
are we are focused on making sure that

1117
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,359
we as a cyber oriented White House

1118
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,980
organization in partnership with our

1119
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,260
space oriented White House organization

1120
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,300
the National Space Council that we as a

1121
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,220
cyber organization are touching space

1122
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,079
industry uh very much for the for the

1123
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,839
reason that you note which which is that

1124
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,300
you know there may be there there is a

1125
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,140
need to bring together those two

1126
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,400
communities to make sure that they are

1127
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,540
communicating

1128
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,040
um you know with each other and able to

1129
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,480
speak the same language and so there

1130
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,700
definitely is an education piece when it

1131
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,440
comes to our our objectives for for

1132
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,300
outreach with the space industry where

1133
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,180
you know as Innovation is is moving

1134
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,980
along quickly cyber may not cyber

1135
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,500
security may not be uh top of mind

1136
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,940
um and so that you know changing that

1137
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,760
mindset and introducing uh and

1138
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,960
emphasizing the importance of cyber

1139
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,640
security by Design is very much a key

1140
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,880
priority and so yes uh space industry is

1141
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,760
is the the key Focus but we will have

1142
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,380
some some cyber companies that are

1143
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,300
already planning to come to the account

1144
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,400
California event and I think as we move

1145
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,900
forward yeah having a good

1146
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,099
representation of the two will be key

1147
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,020
I am yes and I think

1148
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,839
uh go ahead yeah

1149
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,359
um a direct contact for both of us no

1150
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:06,660
but the larger oncd yeah we we do is

1151
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,579
zero point to to make sure that we are

1152
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:09,900
working with them

1153
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,140
yeah I mean if you need to uh

1154
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,440
connect better

1155
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,119
yeah we've had some engagement with a

1156
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,460
space cyber expert who's plugged into

1157
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,720
IEEE

1158
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,098
yes right here

1159
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:39,240
some of which will be degraded uh in the

1160
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,760
next turn

1161
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,000
that be considered in the scope of spd5

1162
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,700
and cyber security risks or space risks

1163
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,660
I I don't think so

1164
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,400
um so I think what we're talking about

1165
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,480
are sort of the assets that'll have sort

1166
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,280
of dual use

1167
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,619
um specifically for our purposes but

1168
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,619
when it comes to sort of

1169
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:10,200
assets that are beyond their lifespan

1170
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,940
which is what I think you're getting at

1171
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,380
right um

1172
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,020
what to do about them in terms of the

1173
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,579
risks that they pose could they be

1174
00:45:17,579 --> 00:45:19,619
leveraged for other purposes or

1175
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:22,619
repurposed I think that's some of the

1176
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,020
conversation that we're having right now

1177
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,579
um maybe not specific to the climate

1178
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:27,960
change question but very much specific

1179
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,720
to some of the the assets that are that

1180
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,040
are already beyond their life cycle

1181
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,480
okay

1182
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,880
there's a couple so maybe over here

1183
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,720
yeah go ahead

1184
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,618
space

1185
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:51,740
it should I would think should apply

1186
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,180
government-wise is there another group

1187
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,800
that looking at the broader picture

1188
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,800
government-wide

1189
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,119
because everything you're saying should

1190
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,380
apply to everybody

1191
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,000
you should be doing it

1192
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,500
yeah I think I think that's absolutely

1193
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,900
right um so kind of zooming back to our

1194
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,520
conversation about the national cyber

1195
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,560
security strategy which is the bigger

1196
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,960
picture uh whole of government whole of

1197
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,020
society a set of principles and policy

1198
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,140
practices to to lead toward that broader

1199
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,180
resilient digital ecosystem so so that's

1200
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,220
kind of the overarching

1201
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,599
um set of principles for this

1202
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,000
Administration and then uh how we're

1203
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,380
thinking about spaces and cyber security

1204
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,780
it's just one of many and I think one of

1205
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,119
probably uh other future to be

1206
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:38,880
articulated specific areas of real world

1207
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,339
threat that require very urgently today

1208
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:43,140
you know applying those principles of

1209
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,119
the national cyber security strategy and

1210
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,619
cyber security by Design and other

1211
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:47,700
policies

1212
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,859
um that are that are in place toward

1213
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:52,380
that effect to a specific

1214
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,020
urgent threat area but uh others are

1215
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,220
absolutely there are other areas of

1216
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,800
effort across our office and will be

1217
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,300
others going forward but this is very

1218
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,400
particularly one that we think needs

1219
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,960
really high level urgent action

1220
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,260
attention

1221
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,960
rest of the government is compared to

1222
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,540
not just space aspect

1223
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,660
yeah so so I think what you're getting

1224
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,180
at is sort of accountability across the

1225
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:21,180
federal ecosystem right and so

1226
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,800
um a lot of the the players that we

1227
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,420
mentioned already so NASA says a FBI NSA

1228
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:30,599
um uh other folks within the Executive

1229
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:31,859
Office of the President the federal

1230
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:33,780
partners that we had on the screen here

1231
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,520
right they're engaged in conversation

1232
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,980
with us right right now

1233
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,720
um Space Systems as I mentioned before

1234
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,339
is not designated as a critical

1235
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:43,319
infrastructure sector

1236
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,140
um so the the idea of one government

1237
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,700
agency governing

1238
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:54,359
all of the all of the uh space assets

1239
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,300
um across the federal ecosystem right

1240
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,700
um that structure does not exist but

1241
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,319
what we're talking about right is having

1242
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,240
that dialogue to see what should be

1243
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,598
feasible

1244
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,940
on this side

1245
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:25,160
um

1246
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,280
sorry can you can you repeat the the

1247
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,420
questions you're talking about

1248
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,819
Country Time Zone but then there's like

1249
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,220
talk about like how oh there's talk

1250
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,319
let's talk about uh

1251
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,000
like what is the time like what are the

1252
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,060
plans for time like this time zone

1253
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:59,400
standardization for places like like

1254
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,560
satellite locations like uh like the

1255
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,140
moon or something like that

1256
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,940
it's a I think that's a really

1257
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,619
interesting

1258
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:08,339
um

1259
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:11,760
issue area but beyond our scope okay uh

1260
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,119
thank you

1261
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,599
so you may be in the back there yeah for

1262
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,839
a little while

1263
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:23,099
uh I got actually one of one questions

1264
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:26,240
so one of the thing item is uh Beyond us

1265
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,520
which is which one's toasters in Leos

1266
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,740
Lindo tomorrow but they're also coming

1267
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:34,680
like Airbus is chilling sell like all

1268
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,200
day long up there uh those people have

1269
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,720
to comply with disraculations and one of

1270
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,460
the problem with satellite Private

1271
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,599
Industry

1272
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:45,420
uh is there's no FAA on that thing

1273
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,880
nobody reviewed the code nobody care

1274
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,579
about safety you just keep launching it

1275
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:53,819
like tomorrow so it's been a way to look

1276
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:56,220
at what they do you can regulate what

1277
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,280
you want this is not a statue they won't

1278
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,480
listen to you

1279
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,880
because you don't have agency to read an

1280
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,280
engineering part of the equation

1281
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,800
and of course they look at the recent

1282
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,740
leak of the Ukraine defense pay-per-view

1283
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,160
thank you
