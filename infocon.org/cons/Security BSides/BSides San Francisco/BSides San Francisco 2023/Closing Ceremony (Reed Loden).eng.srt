2

[Music]

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,880
thank you so much for coming

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,799
um to closing ceremony I know it's not a

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,360
lot of people it's just me ranting about

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,100
things not ranting but talking about

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,260
kind of how the event went giving you

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,359
some uh some numbers announcing some

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,340
prizes and such but really do appreciate

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,199
you being here so first of all I want to

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,240
say just thank you for participating

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,800
um again one of our key aspects about

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,080
b-sides is that there are no attendees

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,880
everybody is a participant everybody has

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,040
something to add to the conversation and

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,739
we think that is extremely critical

19
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,719
um so again thank you for the last two

20
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,360
days of awesome conversations

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,340
um I've heard a lot of great things uh

22
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,079
from folks and I hope you've had a good

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,680
time as well

24
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,399
um so let's talk about uh attendance by

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,300
the numbers

26
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,780
um so we closed out uh with almost 2 000

27
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,219
total participants

28
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,440
um so it's broken down into about 1400

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,760
attendees

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,140
um over uh uh 113 presenters

31
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,119
about 200 volunteers uh 50 villagers 130

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,159
sponsor reps

33

um about 30 leads and staff and then a

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,240
few other groups as well

35
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,180
um and so uh just uh again this is a

36
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,159
great number uh we're still building up

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,320
obviously from where we were in 2020 the

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,020
pandemic changed things of course but

39
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,540
really happy with this number and so

40
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,060

so just some talk this we had the the

43
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,220
highest number of presentations this

44
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,840
year that we've ever had both submit in

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,640
terms of submissions and in terms of

46
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,020
actual talks

47
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,159
um so we've hoped that you actually

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,320
enjoyed the stuff because we had uh it's

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,240
been a lot of work to put that together

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,899
uh especially on our presenter Ops Team

51
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,119
um and so I just want to you know give a

52

that are happening here as you can see

56
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,659
like the the key net thing that I found

57
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,899
interesting here is the over 1400 emails

58
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,780
sent out to all the presenters uh

59
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,099
coordinating everything making sure

60
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,400
everything went well for that and so I

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,500
just want to give a shout out to all of

62
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,480

volunteers to help us out for actually

242
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,160
put this conference on and so we had

243
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,140
about 200 volunteers helping out on a

244
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,760
variety of different things

245
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,500

that our volunteers have put into this

252
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,279
um I know that it can be tough for

253
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,779
everything running around and plans

254
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,300
changing like crazy we know a lot of

255
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,620
volunteers stepped up and actually

256
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,420
worked extra shifts because of the

257
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,220
incident or with stairs and the

258
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,080
escalator and such helping us out with

259
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,000
direct traffic and such so really do

260
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,680
appreciate everybody there so I again

261
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,940
want to shout out to all of our

262
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,980
volunteers lost

263
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,760
whew

264
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,580
uh so one thing we started a couple

265
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,140
years ago was doing challenge coins we

266
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,459
actually haven't talked about it at

267
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:12,959
closing ceremonies but I wanted to shout

268
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,940
out uh to all the folks this year

269
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,620
challenge coins are something that we do

270
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,080
where uh somebody has been just done an

271
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,019
extra special thing uh for this year and

272
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,339
so I'm not going to call out every one

273
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:24,480
of these names

274
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,000
um but these are all the people that

275
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,740
received a challenge coin this year for

276
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,839
just helping out in some way that was

277
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,640
extra special to the to the conference

278
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,140
and so let's give a round of applause

279
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,660
again to everybody on this list here

280
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,339
because they did something special and

281
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:39,480
like really helped to make this

282
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,320
conference possible

283
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,600
again but uh you know all this is true

284
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
but we would not be able to put a

285
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,720
conference on especially in San

286
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,100
Francisco without the money from our

287
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,959
sponsors I'm just gonna be very Frank it

288
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,120
is a very expensive conference we are

289
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,160
the uh most well we are the third

290
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,380
biggest uh b-sides in the world

291
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,820
um first being Vegas second being

292
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,540
besides Canberra actually in Australia

293
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,399
um uh the

294
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,620
um it we are the most expensive by far

295
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,079
uh besides event in fact I bet if you

296
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,640
put all their budgets combined it's

297
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,079
still less than Arts

298
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,579
um just because this is San Francisco

299
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:15,959
which is one of the most expensive

300
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,480
places to run an event like this

301
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,339
um and so and we try to make sure that

302
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,680
we can provide everything for you uh not

303
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,000
just the talks and everything else but

304
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,820
but food and drinks as well and so uh

305
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,019
you know specifically want to call out

306
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,420
uh our four leading sponsors Adobe

307
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,420
appiro code red partners and Google but

308
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,060
all these sponsors here uh contributed

309
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,980
in some way I really hope that you were

310
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,320
