1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,439
this is to talk about rolling out

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,120
webuthen newbie keys to everybody at

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,279
Discord for corporate authentication

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,680
um but first a little bit about me

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,320
hi I'm Alex I work on platform security

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,599
at Discord a lot of infrastructure a lot

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,059
of I.T stuff before that Healthcare

8
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,859
technology uh platform is a service

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,240
company called Alto with an app Sarah

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,680
did electrical engineering back end full

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,699
stack and that brought me to security

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,240
over the last decade or so and

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,500
I want to talk a little about Discord

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,640
security

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,560
we have a pretty uh awesome security

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,079
team nowadays our real intention is to

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,820
make a secure way the easy way we want

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,800
to come meet our users where they work

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,260
means we want developers people who are

20
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,620
Engineers to come talk to us about the

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,820
tools that they're using we know how to

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,440
work on those tools we make PRS the same

23
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,820
way they do

24
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,320
we always want the right solution we

25
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,700
don't just want the easy one and that's

26
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,260
kind of hard in security right like it's

27
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,640
really easy for us to come up with rules

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,260
it's hard for us to come up with things

29
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,640
that actually make people's lives better

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,699
and move the security needle forward

31
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:00,899
was it mean to actually enable

32
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,660
developers enabling our users supporting

33
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,519
BYOD I think if you're a security

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,720
professional you probably have had

35
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,060
challenges around BYOD within your org

36
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,799
if you haven't had that you're either

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,180
very fortunate or you just don't know

38
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,640
about it yet with 400 plus people like

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,260
we have an engine product we absolutely

40
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,180
have that as a challenge we have

41
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,280
desktops we have MacBooks and many more

42
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,320
in many many countries

43
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,640
makes it challenging to do something

44
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,939
like say ship UB keys to all of them

45
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,619
so if you want something that's better

46
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,600
security and better user experience what

47
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,700
do we want security feature we want more

48
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,439
MFA props we want more multi-factor

49
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,939
authentication prompts

50
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,380
things like if you're accessing a

51
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,060
production uh piece of infrastructure

52
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,439
you know accessing a Production Service

53
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,880
uh you're accessing a sensitive

54
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,799
application like your hris system or

55
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,020
doing the role escalations I want to

56
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,340
have some sort of check be like hey are

57
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,659
you actually who you say you are a

58
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,460
presence check in there and you know if

59
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,320
we just start saying more MFA props all

60
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,540
the time the misery index creeps up so

61
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,280
how do we do that while sustaining the

62
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,899
misery index where it's at or ideally

63
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,780
Bringing Down the misery index

64
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,600
so emergency to web authen but first

65
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,460
we're going to talk about MFA and kind

66
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,320
of the state of MFA and why web authent

67
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,119
is what we chose

68
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,520
so why MFA at all starting from the

69
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,379
beginning password reuse is incredibly

70
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,120
incredibly uncommon um you've probably

71
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,640
seen people successfully or successfully

72
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,260
do credential stuffing attacks you know

73
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,060
having breaches from things like have it

74
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,640
been pounds and try to use that on

75
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,319
multiple websites some and within your

76
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,280
org

77
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,660
beyond that phishing attacks are

78
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,819
incredibly prevalent uh we all have

79
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,020
people who have been fished we've all

80
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,459
been fished anyone in this room can be

81
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,720
fished whether you think you can or

82
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,879
cannot you absolutely can be and the

83
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,319
goal of MFA is to raise the cost to

84
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,640
attackers it's not going to make it

85
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,200
impossible but it's making it harder for

86
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,519
somebody to take your credentials and

87
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,580
log into a different website

88
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,739
nobody really uses MFA the stock is

89
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,480
really focused on corporate users and

90
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
this is for users of Twitter Circa I

91
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,379
think July 2021 is when this report last

92
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,959
was pulled but for all types of MFA

93
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,060
across Twitter 2.6 of accounts had any

94
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,400
type of MFA at all the changeover from a

95
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,560
July to December of that period was plus

96
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,599
6.3 percent so really not growing a

97
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,739
whole lot and I think this is pretty

98
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,480
similar but we see at other places

99
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,879
really single digit percentages of MFA

100
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,379
obviously you have more levers you can

101
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,120
push with corporate MFA but it's

102
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,319
something that users are telling us that

103
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,459
they don't really like using because

104
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,800
it's very high friction

105
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
so there's a whole Spectrum right you

106
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,000
have a lot of options of MFA you have

107
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,980
um no MFA right we have one factor we

108
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,959
just have passwords we have SMS and

109
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,599
email we have totp probably the one that

110
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,159
a lot of us are pushing out in orgs and

111
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,780
tftp or push notifications something

112
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,099
that we probably have in a lot of places

113
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,560
we have web authen which I promised we

114
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,180
would come back to and then perfect

115
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,680
security is you live on a Mountaintop

116
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,200
you uh three computer out the window and

117
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,879
you never log on the internet again but

118
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,780
you can't get away with that while

119
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,400
running a business so we go to the next

120
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
best option

121
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,879
so what do we do

122
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,580
web authentic the primer on a better MFA

123
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,920
so what is this what about that is a web

124
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,080
authentication API so the auth n stands

125
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,000
for it's an open standard leveraging

126
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,819
public key cartography so you in general

127
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,500
have a public key that you advertise out

128
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,819
and a private key you keep on your

129
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,080
device talk through the registration

130
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,120
flow in a minute why is this thing so

131
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,260
good like why are people talking about

132
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,000
this why am I talking about this why did

133
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,739
I spend too long working on this uh it's

134
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:11,819
because it's really strong right

135
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,260
leveraging public key cartography is

136
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,400
something that we've used for a lot of

137
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,260
problems in the past let's bring it to

138
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,478
this domain it's scoped you have it

139
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,918
scoped to a certain website you know you

140
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,779
do it for for instance discordapp.com

141
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,240
you don't have to do it to Discord weird

142
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,699
a that looks like an idpu.com let's go

143
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,440
up to a certain domain and to test it

144
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,880
you're tested from the Hardware security

145
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,400
module on your device so these are kind

146
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,500
of put on the principles let's talk

147
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,699
through what this registration flow

148
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:36,840
looks like

149
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,639
so you have a device in this case it's a

150
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,440
cell phone but there's a wide plethora

151
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,900
of devices all of them valid you

152
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,220
register by saying I want to create a

153
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,780
new account with the site the site says

154
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,639
sure generate me a public key you donate

155
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,560
the private key as well so the key pair

156
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,000
is generated we send the public key off

157
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,740
to The Ether and the private key is only

158
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,060
ever kept on the device and you've

159
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,740
registered a website and just as a shout

160
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,720
out webauthen.guide is a great website

161
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,340
it's where all these graphs are pulled

162
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,540
from

163
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,460
so you have registration now you have

164
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,360
the handshake when you're actually

165
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,040
trying to authenticate you have a device

166
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,979
come and say hey I want to sign in so

167
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,900
the device says please or sorry the

168
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,220
service says please sign this data

169
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,419
because payload so I know that it's

170
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,740
really you so I can do that at a station

171
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,780
we're talking about

172
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,580
so on the device you come back you say

173
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,320
cool here's a Blog I want to sign up my

174
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,759
private key and then you pass that back

175
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,919
up saying here's a signature it shows

176
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,660
like no one can be tempered in transit

177
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,400
and the website says let's take that

178
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
public key let's verify the signature

179
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,160
and great it checks out you can sign in

180
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,620
so how do we use web authent I talked a

181
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,820
little about logistics it's going to be

182
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,680
the second half of this talk but

183
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,880
um the spoilers you probably already

184
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,139
have things that could act as a web

185
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,060
weapon authenticator you may already be

186
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,259
using it under the hood even if you

187
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,060
don't know that it's kind of two big

188
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,860
categories there's external and roaming

189
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,780
authenticators Yuba Keys Titan security

190
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,820
Keys other things like that and then

191
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,780
there are internal or platform

192
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,520
authenticators you know MacBook Touch ID

193
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,880
face ID on iPhones Android fingerprint

194
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,440
unlock Windows hello things that are

195
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,880
inherent to the platform whereas the

196
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,199
roaming key is something that you plug

197
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,120
in walk around with it can roam with you

198
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,680
you don't need to be tied to your laptop

199
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,080
for that one to work

200
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,880
so it's a little bit of a breakdown of

201
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,919
ATL account takeover prevention rates by

202
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,840
type this is from Google security blog

203
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,120
which is excellent comparing on device

204
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,880
prompts so push notification SMS code

205
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,860
security key and then a few other types

206
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,199
of MFA and you can see that the efficacy

207
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,060
of security Keys is really really good

208
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,560
which is awesome this is even for

209
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,940
targeted attacks which are the yellow

210
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,680
bars I'm colorblind I hope they're

211
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,960
yellow the bottom and you can see that

212
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,880
they have 100 for all the cases that

213
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,960
they've been auditing which is really

214
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,419
great so by the way Google research has

215
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,560
made it really easy to make this case

216
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,880
internally I'll quote that more later

217
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,259
but just shout out thank you for making

218
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,539
it easy to make this sell

219
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,060
so more Google research here we've had

220
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,259
no reported or confirmed account

221
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,000
takeover since inline security keys at

222
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,319
Google and that is Google I imagine

223
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,419
people are trying to hack Google people

224
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,039
who work there and they said they

225
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,419
haven't seen anybody get compromised in

226
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,860
this way it's really cool to be able to

227
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,880
take one of these threats off the table

228
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,560
because we have enough keeping all of us

229
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,840
up at night

230
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,780
so then what about that at Discord I

231
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,520
work at Discord this is how I make the

232
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,780
case for better corporate MFA for

233
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,460
Discord and hopefully can help all you

234
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,419
make the case if you're not already

235
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,000
using web but then internally

236
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,039
so security is not an island we've hired

237
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,120
a lot of talks about this this weekend

238
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,180
people need to come to terms with us and

239
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,699
US agree to them like how important a

240
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,259
thing is and how much is it worth

241
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,479
disrupting workflows ideally like I said

242
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,460
we can move the security bar up without

243
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,780
blowing up people's workloads without

244
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,400
increasing that misery index ideally

245
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,960
stakeholders go up at misery index

246
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,940
either stays flat or goes down

247
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,860
so we had a lot of stakeholders to work

248
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,680
with I.T Engineers CX people who were

249
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,599
both ftes within the company as well as

250
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,919
people who work outside of the company

251
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,180
all of whom work together to make

252
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,099
Discord great so the mission here was

253
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,419
that we had to show that this was safer

254
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,580
than the status quo it's in better MFA

255
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,259
more effective I want to show that it

256
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:50,759
was easier too this wouldn't just be

257
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,280
incurring that misery index on there we

258
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,300
also want to show that it was cost

259
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,440
effective you know you're talking about

260
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,880
buying new Hardware in a lot of these

261
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,960
cases so it's going to cost some money

262
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,819
it's going to cause some disruption how

263
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,979
do you show that's worthwhile to do this

264
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,080
so safer again shout out to Google he

265
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,940
made my job here really easy we've had

266
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,740
no confirmed uh no reported or confirmed

267
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,000
account takeover since employing

268
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,560
security keys at Google

269
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
that's big right so really easy to make

270
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,099
that case saying this is the de facto

271
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,360
standard people have been moving toward

272
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,800
and it's not just Google there's also

273
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,599
great research coinbase security blog

274
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,099
also has some great uh talking about

275
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,680
rolling out this internally as well

276
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,500
easier to use so you can all see here

277
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,180
it's kind of a jumbled mess of all the

278
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,919
different Topp authenticators and I'm

279
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,479
not knocking to be on authentication

280
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,520
whatsoever I use it all the time

281
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,719
but you know you're getting your phone

282
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,399
out of your pocket you're logging in I

283
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,719
use authy and I have to use my

284
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,219
fingerprint ID twice to log into that

285
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,260
people feel the urgency as well of the

286
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,299
time-based nature of this too and

287
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,620
something that just adds friction every

288
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,940
time you add this prompt if I want to

289
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,500
say do this every time you're pushing a

290
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,760
commit or every time you're logging into

291
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,500
a server it's going to make people get

292
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,700
their phone in and out of their pocket

293
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,500
unless you have a cell phone holster and

294
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,820
if you do it's still going to increase

295
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,640
the misery index quite a bit

296
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
so I think it's easier to use web out

297
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,839
then and we're hearing that from our you

298
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:02,040
know users at the end of the day as well

299
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,380
the most common experience at discordant

300
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,180
is 80 of people are working on MacBook

301
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,220
Pros and they register the Touch ID on

302
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,660
the device and you just tap it when you

303
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,940
get the prompt for other devices we have

304
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,160
Windows hello you also have ubiques of a

305
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,720
wide variety I'll talk more about what

306
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,240
we lean toward later on but you don't

307
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,620
have to fish uh phones in your pocket

308
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,240
and if you're fishing resistant with web

309
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,920
authen MFA as well the friction is

310
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,480
really low and which means you can say

311
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,100
we can start playing with MFA prompts

312
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,060
and adding them all over the place

313
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,660
without increasing that misery index

314
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,519
is it cost effective that's the next big

315
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,279
one right uh two factors per user is

316
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,080
about you know 30 to 75 per person

317
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,760
depending upon the kind of prompt that

318
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,440
you're doing the kind of uh you know

319
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,240
keys that you're rolling out you also

320
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,260
have to worry about an increased burden

321
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,240
on it distribute and service like we

322
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,380
have to talk about shipping this to

323
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,120
every new hire everybody who comes in

324
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,640
Discord works from everywhere so we have

325
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,200
an office most people never come into it

326
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,459
so how do we enable that how do we

327
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,839
enable people in countries all around

328
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:56,640
the world without you know ruining it's

329
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,500
life because they are great it really

330
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,060
helped me roll this project and they

331
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,860
would not be as happy about it if I you

332
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,540
know took up all their time servicing

333
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,760
lockout requests for instance if you're

334
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,140
comparing this not to an action right

335
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,700
you're comparing this to the cost of an

336
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,620
action the cost of an action on average

337
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,320
from 2022 report from IBM a successful

338
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,700
phishing attack at a company is about

339
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,339
five million dollars 4.9 million dollars

340
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,019
I think we can all think through like

341
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:20,820
whoever gets fish depending upon who

342
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,080
that person is and what kind of standing

343
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,459
access they have it can probably go a

344
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,380
lot higher than that too

345
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,540
so again shout out to research from

346
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,519
Google this is talking about the support

347
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,160
incident so the burden to I.T you can

348
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,899
see here that the support incidence of

349
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,820
lockouts precipitously dropped as people

350
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,500
adopt Hardware security Keys which is

351
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,899
awesome to see so you can see over time

352
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,300
the support rate from OTP drops and for

353
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,920
Hardware security Keys it's flies they

354
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,839
rolled it out throughout the org

355
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,220
for the deployment we found the

356
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,720
increased user productivity and the

357
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,519
decreased support costs were worth the

358
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,620
increased Hardware cost so that's big it

359
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,480
really helped make the case this way not

360
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,980
only are you decreasing the burden in

361
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,600
I.T but you're also saying the decree

362
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,160
increases your productivity from being

363
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,959
locked out less often less support

364
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,100
requests means that people are getting

365
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,440
far fewer lockouts than they were before

366
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,240
so it's not just that cost in I.T it's

367
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,560
the cost amortized across your whole

368
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,459
organization it's big cost savings

369
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:12,600
everyone gets Yuba Keys some people get

370
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,519
you two UB keys somebody gets a Mac like

371
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,740
a touch ID keyboard something like that

372
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,899
we have a wide spectrum of devices that

373
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:20,820
we support here but it's cost effective

374
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,019
and we can make exceptions like that

375
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,120
because really savings are worth at the

376
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,920
end of the day

377
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,779
so we sell people but what's the plan we

378
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,579
sold them on

379
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,220
step one get everyone asterisks and to

380
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,140
OCTA and get every asterisk app into

381
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,480
octave anybody here who's been early on

382
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,220
Security Programs knows that time is a

383
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,720
flat circle you see a lot of the same

384
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,579
themes you get people behind MFA or

385
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:43,079
behind SSO rather it's the first thing

386
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,240
that you do for us we did that with OCTA

387
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,560
something we started the ball rolling on

388
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,720
prior to starting this project

389
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,540
step two get two plus authenticators to

390
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,339
everybody a platform in a roaming is

391
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:54,899
what we decided upon but it could really

392
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,180
be any of those some groups we wanted to

393
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,519
go with uh three for redundancy so execs

394
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,260
or people who are super admins in Octa G

395
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,880
Suite super admins people have high

396
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
privileged accounts that are hard to

397
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,779
service if they get locked out or have a

398
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,100
lot of risk we got multiple

399
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,180
authenticators for those because again

400
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,620
you're talking a cost of like thirty

401
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,820
dollars for an authenticator fifty

402
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,680
dollars for an authenticator much lower

403
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,480
than the uh the risk of compromise or

404
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,180
the risk of lockout in these cases

405
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,220
step three uh we've heard this a few

406
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,600
times this weekend in other talks but

407
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
it's important to start testing on us so

408
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,320
when we laid out the strategy if we

409
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,640
wanted to start rolling this out too

410
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,800
gradually the first step is security if

411
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,000
this is a bad experience we want to feel

412
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
that pain first and when we come to

413
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,540
other users we want to say hey we've

414
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,680
been dealing with this for a month and

415
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,880
it's actually better than it was before

416
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,680
it builds trust with your users if

417
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,579
you're going through this sort of stuff

418
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,260
and not just imposing it upon them and

419
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,180
saying we'll get to it later so we did

420
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,579
security infrastructure it execs

421
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:46,620
engineering all ftes and then everybody

422
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,540
again Discord has people all over the

423
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,860
world in all different capacities

424
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,180
working for us that all help make

425
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,040
Discord great we want to make sure we

426
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,899
encompassed all of them reduce the risk

427
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,279
across the board

428
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,560
from there we had an exception group in

429
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,420
octave so this is kind of octa-specific

430
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,860
whatever your SSO provider is probably

431
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,959
has similar functionality but for us we

432
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,459
had an authentication policy that said

433
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,260
everybody needs to get password and web

434
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,060
authent prompt to log in or webathon

435
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,339
prompts on these certain cases except

436
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,139
for people in this exception group so

437
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,579
it's allow us to say okay we can opt in

438
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,079
the whole category but if this one

439
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,700
person infrastructure is on paternity

440
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,620
leave or whatever else we can opt them

441
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,720
out so which is awesome to have you can

442
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,459
say like these long tail cases you know

443
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:25,560
someone's ubiki got lost in the mail it

444
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,360
was stolen whatever that's fine add them

445
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,440
to the exception group but follow up on

446
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,600
them judiciously and then over time you

447
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,980
see you shrink the number of people in

448
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,079
the exception group but you keep it

449
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,220
around in case there are lockouts or

450
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,839
loss authenticators there's always cases

451
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,160
like this where somebody gets stuck in

452
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,839
some sort of exception case so it gives

453
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,820
you that flexibility we had a lot of

454
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,040
moving pieces here but we had enough uh

455
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,480
you know kind of back doors if we needed

456
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,740
to to get people into a working

457
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,380
condition while we roll This Out

458
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,120
so we had some tools to work with here

459
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,579
right I talked earlier about platform

460
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,040
versus roaming authenticators the first

461
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,300
most common thing was that people had

462
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,160
MacBooks already they had Touch ID on

463
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,000
there so this is something people

464
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,560
already knew how to use people are often

465
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,760
using this to log into their devices

466
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,560
it's a really familiar interface which

467
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,519
is nice

468
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,380
but past that you can also have Windows

469
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,360
hello other devices like that you can

470
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,920
also have web compatible keyboards you

471
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,120
know some people keep their laptops in

472
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,040
docked mode we're pretty lacks about

473
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,779
like you can use any Factor as long as a

474
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,160
web authen factor and we will probably

475
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,540
support you we want to meet your users

476
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,680
where they are because we're asking for

477
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,060
a change of behavior so it's important

478
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,279
to come to them

479
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,079
has that we want a roaming authenticator

480
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,519
so it's important to have two plus

481
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,200
factors to decrease that lockout we

482
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,180
talked about earlier so we chose to use

483
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,600
the UB key security key C NFC uh it's

484
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,100
kind of a mouthful it's this blue key

485
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,139
about 30 bucks a pop and one of the

486
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,279
really cool things about it is you can

487
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,800
bootstrap a new phone using NFC so if

488
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,240
you have a phone you want to use it as

489
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,220
an OCTA authenticator itself with Web

490
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,079
Bot then you can tap on the back with

491
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,180
NFC and use it that way one of the other

492
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,160
things sort of like a ux philosophy here

493
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,899
you don't want both your factors to

494
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,339
often travel together you know you can

495
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,199
have the low profile 5c Nanos that live

496
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,540
inside the laptops but if the Key C and

497
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,279
A C is Big it's probably not going to

498
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,660
travel with laptops because it sticks

499
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,040
out like this and so we want them to

500
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,199
live in separate locations that was my

501
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,760
theory of the case

502
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,220
so it is 2fa for us it's 2fa you can use

503
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,260
these for uh your single factor for pass

504
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,339
keys I'm not going to touch on that too

505
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,260
much today but very exciting highly

506
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,300
recommend reading more so we have a plan

507
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,399
sounds pretty easy right

508
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,800
let's talk about what actually happens

509
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,839
so we have a plan timeline all good

510
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,220
projects should have a plan timeline and

511
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,420
they should all be as optimistic as I

512
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,199
was

513
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,320
so we started this off in May 2022. um

514
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,060
June we had it all rolled out to or we

515
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,959
wanted to have it all rolled out

516
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,420
security it infront execs so on and so

517
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,680
forth basically one month after another

518
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,420
we're like cool four weeks is long

519
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,920
enough to get some address and ship out

520
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,480
Keys no problem it's like basically

521
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Amazon right what could go wrong

522
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,180
uh it went pretty well um but everybody

523
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,920
was a long tail after that you can see

524
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,420
it pushing off the page there so we went

525
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,740
into this year

526
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,420
people who were ftes we were able to get

527
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,680
to them pretty quickly but that long

528
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,420
tail case is a very very long tail

529
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,079
because you're talking International

530
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,579
Logistics at this point and if you take

531
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,500
away one thing this talk is that when

532
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,699
you go through this figure out your

533
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,339
International Logistics Way in advance

534
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,199
so if I come into a distributed Global

535
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,139
team is really really hard and I don't

536
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,519
work for importers but just pay for

537
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,779
importers for these countries that are

538
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,519
really difficult for something I wish

539
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,380
that we did uh coming back to we got

540
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,000
stuck in a few cases and having somebody

541
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,100
who knew how to do customs in a country

542
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,959
like Columbia or the Philippines would

543
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,360
have saved us weeks if not months

544
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,920
another key learning as I mentioned this

545
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,540
earlier is test on yourself so I think

546
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,920
why we were able to roll so quickly

547
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,300
through everybody within the companies

548
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,040
that we knew what would work like for

549
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,600
the most complicated cases people who

550
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,459
were accessing infrastructure so by

551
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,839
testing on ourselves we heard our

552
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,760
concerns we were able to understand what

553
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,440
this flow would be like and we knew what

554
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,699
the most complicated cases would

555
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,500
interact like

556
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,779
shipping shipping Logistics really the

557
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,360
biggest part of this we used uh the

558
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,860
ubico Enterprise delivery portal it

559
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,480
works really well all we did was take

560
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,699
from our his system export basically a

561
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,860
dump of everybody's addresses ship them

562
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,839
a key or two and then send it out and

563
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,459
you can do a bulk CSV upload using

564
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,079
ubercon Enterprise delivery super simple

565
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,639
highly recommended

566
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,160
for nonefts it's harder remote work and

567
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,439
agencies make this hard again I'm going

568
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:05,640
to keep repeating this work with local

569
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,079
importers if you're working with like a

570
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,939
business partner outsourcer firm or BPO

571
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,559
work with them figure out the best way

572
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,179
to distribute it to them and figure

573
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,299
these out far far in advance

574
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,640
Imports the biggest delays for us were

575
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,079
in Philippines and Colombia and that's

576
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,280
really coming down to like I've never

577
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,020
done anything like this before we hired

578
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,160
somebody with procurement experience

579
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,660
like halfway through this project which

580
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,699
is a godsend but by that point we

581
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:27,839
already had things out the door that

582
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,820
were just waiting in customs so again

583
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,280
highly recommend getting importers would

584
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,419
have saved us less than 10 grand and

585
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,679
probably four or five months in some

586
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,960
cases by just getting importers

587
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,820
somebody in leadership so shout out to

588
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,260
Discord leadership and you should all be

589
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,179
happy enough to work at a place that has

590
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,980
leadership willing to theoretically

591
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,539
bring a duffel bag full of UB keys to

592
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,100
the Philippines didn't come down to that

593
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,240
but we had people who were willing to

594
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,120
hop on a plane with say 600 700 UV keys

595
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,260
so this is pretty awesome we're hiring

596
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,960
so okay uh we touched Logistics I've

597
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,419
touched enough on importers um

598
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,240
uh for enforcement we have OCTA as our

599
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,280
wedge right so OCTA is um we're going to

600
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,539
have a long tail of apps and users

601
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,340
people who need to be moved into OCTA

602
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,840
apps when you want to put behind OCTA

603
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,520
it's okay to have a long tail you know

604
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,900
some apps just never support SSO

605
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,120
unfortunately so you want to focus on

606
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,799
the things that are the most impactful

607
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,059
that people will be using on a regular

608
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,919
basis you want to get through the

609
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,600
rollout and then work on exemptions

610
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,860
you're always gonna have somebody who's

611
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,059
fish ether you be key there's always

612
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,260
weird cases that you will never

613
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,340
anticipate because International

614
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,679
Logistics because of male theft or

615
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,000
people move especially during remote

616
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,220
work it's hard just have exemption group

617
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,600
and follow up on it make sure you're

618
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,280
working with your users and saying like

619
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,080
Okay it's like 48 Hours 72 hours

620
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,700
whatever reasonable like how quickly can

621
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,020
we get this key to you in a way that's

622
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,600
not going to make your life really hard

623
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,140
so I want to finish the call to action

624
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,940
this is worth doing this is a painful

625
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,799
Learning lesson for me on the pains and

626
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,179
joys of international Logistics but

627
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,679
hopefully my tips can help make this

628
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:53,880
easier for all of you doing this

629
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,280
phishing attacks successful ones at that

630
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,200
are incredibly incredibly pervasive and

631
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,880
again I want to reinforce that anyone in

632
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,620
here myself everybody in here all

633
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,120
Security Professionals anybody seeing

634
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,580
this in the future can get fished what

635
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,260
about then is phishing resistance it's

636
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,520
not fish proof but it's something that

637
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,960
is really really hard to fish you have

638
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,640
the interactions the MFA prompt which is

639
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,820
something that is really really strong

640
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,860
okay what about that in you what can you

641
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,020
do to prepare for this first advice is

642
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,520
to know where everyone when the works in

643
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,780
the world far in advance which sounds

644
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,240
really obvious right and it is but I'll

645
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,679
say that like remote work makes that

646
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,840
really complicated and people move uh we

647
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,460
had missed deliveries because of that

648
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,260
so get a good wedge next to prioritize

649
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,720
for SSO for us that was OCTA and then

650
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,700
zendesk so a lot of our BPO again

651
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,320
business partner outsourcer agencies are

652
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,360
working in zendesk day in and day out so

653
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,620
that's something we could get an app

654
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,240
that like half of our entire user

655
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,039
population used on a daily basis and

656
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,360
identifying that is the right thing to

657
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,640
put behind SSO first made it so that we

658
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,080
could move groups in and know that they

659
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,280
would have it in force on a regular

660
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,700
Cadence

661
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,660
next up identify countries not supported

662
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,400
by your shipping partner early you

663
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,720
become Enterprise delivery was really

664
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,220
helpful shout out they did a great job

665
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,299
with the portal but they don't have full

666
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,679
coverage because International Logistics

667
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,760
are hard so there are some countries

668
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,380
where they really can't help you so

669
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,820
figure that out far in advance and then

670
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,020
figure out what your alternative means

671
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,059
are and I'm happy to help with this like

672
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,280
I wish that uh we had something like

673
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,840
this to say like hey the Philippines

674
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,100
you're going to want to work on that in

675
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,140
June

676
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,120
okay and the rest of the call to action

677
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,100
what about that in you please support it

678
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,320
Apache browser and device support is one

679
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,700
of the biggest hurdles we have to

680
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,039
adoption we have an open standard here

681
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,900
and you can sort of see up on the screen

682
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,640
some of the patchwork support it's a

683
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,080
little fuzzy up there this comes from

684
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,059
webathon.me a lot of great compatibility

685
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,500
about like can I actually use this with

686
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,539
my browser with my device we have an

687
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,220
open standard here and really to

688
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,539
everybody out there working at different

689
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,039
companies to help improve this support

690
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,780
it extend it so we can make this the

691
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,460
standard so it's not sort of an

692
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,840
exceptional thing that we all are doing

693
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,100
this as a baseline because the more

694
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,120
support that we have the more

695
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,980
multiplicative this effort becomes and

696
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,679
becomes more worthwhile doing

697
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,240
so with that I want to leave some time

698
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,100
for Q a what questions people have

699
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,039
yeah we're here

700
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,340
actual personal devices and save mobile

701
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,879
access to

702
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,200
yeah so questions about BYOD which I

703
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,760
mentioned kind of in passing how do you

704
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,179
handle access to uh services from

705
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,760
personal devices with doing a rollout of

706
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,740
Web Bot then so

707
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,640
um I think one thing that we were

708
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,960
flexible on early on that I haven't

709
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,580
heard everybody be flexible on is that

710
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,020
you can use your personal cell phone as

711
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,700
an authenticator if you want to set up

712
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,320
your iPhone or your Android phone not a

713
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,760
work phone as an authenticator we're

714
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,380
okay with that so you can access OCTA

715
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,059
apps on your phone otherwise we would

716
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,860
disrupt some people's workflows we use

717
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,299
people that you know they play a game

718
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,159
and they would review PR's on their

719
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,080
phone in between rounds of that game we

720
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,280
wanted to keep enabling that because

721
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,900
they want to do that and we don't want

722
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,640
to just shut that off so we're flexible

723
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,559
on that we're also flexible on the type

724
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,780
of Yuba Cube so we really wanted to

725
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,640
focus on the security key cnfc as the

726
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,620
standard but then if someone asks a

727
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,840
question like hey you know I have um we

728
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,100
have a game Studio at Discord actually

729
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,080
and they all use desktops and so they're

730
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,460
like it's not going to work for us using

731
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,260
this USBC thing I was like cool I've

732
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,240
been getting some USB a devices so

733
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,159
that's supporting their use case one

734
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,240
that I didn't even realize that we had

735
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,159
you want to set a standard so you can

736
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:12,720
kind of converge around what docs and

737
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,799
support there are and know what the

738
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,659
standard onboarding package is that'd be

739
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:16,799
really flexible after that someone's

740
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,539
like hey got a problem here you figure

741
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,100
out cool what's the thing I can get you

742
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,780
that'll make you successful

743
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,600
does that answer the question cool

744
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,139
over there

745
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,360
yeah so the question is about usability

746
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,580
feedback from non-engineering users

747
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,240
um

748
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,220
honestly most of it was not getting much

749
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,140
feedback at all which sometimes is the

750
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,000
best feedback to get I did talk to

751
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,679
people and kind of do sampling polls of

752
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,120
people working in different roles across

753
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,039
the company in general people do not

754
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,100
miss to tpmfa for OCTA we didn't allow

755
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,620
octopush verify or octave verify push at

756
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,000
the time we started doing this so it was

757
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
comparing that to tftp

758
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,679
um yeah people who are working in the

759
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,720
mode case really like touch ID something

760
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,980
people are already used to using and

761
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,600
then being flexible on the interactions

762
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,400
with uh you know different other ebqs

763
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,500
people really enjoyed that too

764
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,700
Yeah question right there

765
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:26,100
so the question is about comparing the

766
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,559
efficacy at scale of security key cnfc

767
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,440
to the USB 5c Nano is that the one

768
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,380
you're talking about

769
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:37,880
5cnfc um I don't use the 5cmsc directly

770
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,960
comparing it directly to the 5c Nano

771
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,919
which is the one that we were looking at

772
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,840
primarily because the NFC thing was like

773
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,340
it was sort of a nice to have we didn't

774
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,539
need to have that for bootstrapping

775
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:47,520
authenticators but I was about choosing

776
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,440
for byd purposes to allow people to use

777
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,880
personal devices

778
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,159
there's a few things that you need to

779
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,360
consider when you're looking at what key

780
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,039
to support and that's a lot of like what

781
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,299
are the authentication protocols

782
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,760
supported by this key security key NFC

783
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,260
is actually pretty restrictive and that

784
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,820
supports like u2f mode and that's all we

785
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,320
wanted so actually some things that you

786
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,460
may want to turn off if you have the

787
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,620
five scene Nano like um I think we've

788
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,179
all seen at orgs when you touch the UB

789
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,799
key and you get like an OTP code spanned

790
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,720
in the chat it's fun you would sneeze

791
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,700
but you don't necessarily want that and

792
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,260
so the key to NFC having the limitation

793
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,179
of not having OTP mode it's actually

794
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:19,440
kind of a user benefit because you don't

795
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,640
have to worry about turning that off and

796
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,620
you can do customization with ubico but

797
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,000
it requires paying extra and shutting

798
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,860
down the assembly line so it's kind of a

799
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,140
headache to deal with

800
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,640
yeah a question right next to the last

801
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,820
question

802
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,820
yeah um the question is about uh

803
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,260
different compatibility and support

804
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,600
issues with embedded browsers one of the

805
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,860
big ones and I think the still problem

806
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,500
is with hris workday logging in

807
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,240
specifically on mobile that's one of the

808
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,880
big ones that we saw and uh the way you

809
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,260
work around it is by allowing people in

810
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,640
temporary exception groups for setting

811
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,900
up those apps because the sessions are

812
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,700
pretty long-lived it's not the best

813
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,200
experience but again because the

814
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,580
supports kind of Patchwork on different

815
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,380
browsers especially like um you know

816
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,820
mobile browsers that are embedded like

817
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,039
it's a great call out for now that's the

818
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,120
best thing we can come up with is like

819
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,380
when you want to log in that way we set

820
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,640
the session that way and it'll have some

821
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,900
sort of refresh I have no idea what the

822
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,039
refresh mechanism is with workday

823
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,900
specifically but something when we want

824
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,100
to allow people to use that from their

825
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,600
phone that's how we did that I think

826
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,039
setting up Google Calendar was also a

827
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,240
pain point if I remember correctly with

828
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,460
that and so same sort of uh same sort of

829
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,659
issue same sort of Remedy there

830
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,640
exception group set it up take them out

831
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,720
of the exception group so you just

832
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,520
exempt them from one of them one

833
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,600
important call out the exception group

834
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,919
that I probably should have mentioned is

835
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,720
uh we didn't say like okay you just have

836
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,760
no MFA now people have backup tootp

837
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,200
already set up or if they don't when

838
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,480
they go into sign in with OCTA again

839
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,179
they set up totp MFA so they fall back

840
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:46,559
to that so we never have people logging

841
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,000
in without MFA there's always a backup

842
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,580
authentication mechanism standard so

843
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,960
people are still using trtp when they're

844
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,520
logging in with a new OCTA session this

845
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,539
is about you're trying to create a

846
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,039
session to log into an existing app we

847
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:57,360
can exception group you for now and

848
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,419
things will be okay

849
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:02,760
Yeah question right up front

850
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,220
yeah uh it's uh two questions there I'm

851
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,299
gonna go to the next slide too so in

852
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,440
case I have any other questions you can

853
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,720
find me afterwards but um two questions

854
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,159
there first one is we use any other

855
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:13,440
features of the UB key like storing um

856
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,120
OTP codes on the UB key itself and

857
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,159
generating OTP codes from that answer

858
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,779
that one um we haven't used that we've

859
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,760
been still using OTP like uh apps like

860
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,860
authy or Google Authenticator again we

861
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,940
like intentionally chose a pretty

862
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,340
restrictive um key the key cnfc is the

863
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,200
standard that we came down to the second

864
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,520
question is about Windows hello

865
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,260
specifically setting a pin yeah that was

866
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,940
a pain point that we felt fortunately we

867
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,340
have limited users of Windows and so

868
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,260
what we did is for those users we had it

869
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,720
go through and disable the pin mode

870
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,299
using YK man which is command line tool

871
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,340
so you can turn it off that way but it

872
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,360
is unfortunate that we have to do some

873
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,679
manual operations this is again one of

874
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:47,940
the goals here was to not put too much

875
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,919
burden onto it just want to give a shout

876
