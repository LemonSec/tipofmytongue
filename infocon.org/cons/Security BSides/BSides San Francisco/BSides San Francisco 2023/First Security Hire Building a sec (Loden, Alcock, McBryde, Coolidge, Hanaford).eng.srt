23
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,079

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,239
with more all uh companies and early

25
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,860
stage companies looking to invest in

26
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,320
security and building a culture of cyber

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,300
security we get to hear from industry

professional Journey

30

49
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,880
seven something like that Incident

50
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,860
Management knocks before that but

51
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,900
interesting career

52
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,420
hey everyone Colleen Coolidge I was

53
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,299
formerly at twilio and segment as the

54
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,640
CSO but I've been in security since like

55
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,700
2005 so do some math and figure some

56
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,460
things out too long

57
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,619
um I haven't actually been the first

58
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,060
Security hire sometimes I've been the

59
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,619
second or third hire

60
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,840

73
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,280
questions

76
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,560

78
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,920
that into their different roles is there

79
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,660
anybody in the room that is on this

80
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,800
journey

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,300
um where they're maybe a First Security

82
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,940
hire a early stage company and looking

83
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,920
forward to to get some helpful hints and

84
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,540
tips this afternoon

85
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,280
yep a couple of hands around that I can

86
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,379
see one at the back great stuff good

87
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,000
stuff we'll we'll jump straight it's

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,440
just um some of the questions and I

89
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,180
think a question that comes up very

90
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,920
commonly for me

91
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,720
um with maybe some of the VC intros that

92
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,239
we get or early stage companies that are

93
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,180
really interested on where to start is I

94
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,500
guess the first question to you all is

95
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,159
when is the right time for a Founder CEO

96
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,400
CTO to start thinking about making their

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,420
first security higher

98
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,560
yeah go ahead I would say that uh I mean

99
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,540
definitely security is unless you were

100
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,640
building something that is like actually

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,280
a security product at heart you want to

102
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,800
get a product Market fit first you want

103
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,659
to make sure that you know whatever

104
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,879
you're you're doing uh is actually going

105
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,860
to work now once you get to that point

106
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,260
then like okay now let's make sure we

107
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,400
can actually secure it and everything

108
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,480
else like that no you shouldn't just

109
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,060
ignore security obviously but like it

110
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,680
generally you know you're not seeing a

111
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,500
full security team being built out at a

112
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,900
seed or a series a company

113
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,959
um and so I I think that make sure you

114
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,700
have a product and that it's something

115
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,500
that is is going to sell

116
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,120
um and then you're like okay how can I

117
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,739
make sure to based off what I've already

118
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,840
been doing uh to actually build on that

119
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,220
and make sure that everything I'm doing

120
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,260
is secure a lot of times you have

121
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,420
security then can also include things

122
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,820
like compliance selling SAS especially

123
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,798
nowadays is going to require you to

124
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,740
basically be sock 2 or ISO 27001

125
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,540
certified

126
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,400
um and so it's kind of like a you know a

127
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,740
day one kind of thing there so that's

128
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,840
where the security person will gonna

129
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,679
help you out on that so

130
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,259
I I mean I think that if your tiny

131
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,440
company if it's 15 people or 10 people

132
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,940
you know I'm not really sure you want to

133
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,199
go out and like I feel like I'm

134
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,580
betraying the whole security industry

135
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,960
but I'm not sure you want to go out and

136
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,000
hire a large security team

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,860
um because you know as he was mentioning

138
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,900
like you need to make sure that there's

139
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,460
product Market fit and that there's a

140
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,419
chance that people are going to pay you

141
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,500
otherwise the company's just not going

142
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,940
to be around six to nine months from now

143
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,979
ideally

144
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,020
um the company that's small even if you

145
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,639
don't have a security person or you're

146
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,040
the only security person I think the

147
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,840
best use of your time is educating the

148
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,699
rest of the 15 people in the company to

149
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,500
think the way that you do maybe you

150
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,440
teach them how to threat model you curse

151
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,240
slash gift them with some of the

152
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,940
paranoia that we all have and so that

153
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,740
they develop eyes in the back of their

154
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,900
head so it's not just you trying to

155
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,639
chase after 15 people to make sure that

156
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,560
they set up everything perfectly but you

157
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,259
give them that little curse

158
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,479
um and then they will

159
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,340
make your life a little easier and your

160
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,800
future security team's life so I say put

161
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,360
it off until you're pretty sure the

162
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,820
company is going to survive

163
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,759
yeah the uh the the way I've explained

164
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,680
in the past it's like when you're a

165
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,419
series B companies here's a company like

166
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,940
the biggest risk for you is not making a

167
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,919
sale right you can't make the sale you

168
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,240
can't get the revenue you can't make

169
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,560
your board happy your next funding

170
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,720
around is worse like that's the biggest

171
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,680
risk uh and so it's it's you know when

172
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,880
you're talking to customers when you're

173
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,259
talking to stuff like are you getting

174
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,880
blocked on security are you starting to

175
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,440
get to the point where they're like hey

176
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,720
you need to start getting good at sock 2

177
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
or you need to start getting better

178
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,199
communicating with us or you know hey

179
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,400
let me introduce you to your security

180
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,960
architect and now you have like the CTO

181
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,520
like talking to a security architect and

182
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,100
that's sometimes goes horrifically so

183
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,860
like when you get to that point that's a

184
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,300
really good time to be like okay now we

185
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,620
need to hire someone full-time to come

186
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,199
in and like start getting a handle on

187
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,580
this

188
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,560
yeah I think to add to that there's some

189
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,180
amount of it where security can be a

190
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,759
shared responsibility for some some

191
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,400
lifespan of a company early on and then

192
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,979
at the point at which it becomes like

193
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,319
additively some full-time employees

194
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,539
worth of of time that's probably a good

195
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,060
time to start thinking about it yep

196
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,500
I think for me

197
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,680
um what we see commonly is a lot of

198
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,400
intros to series a companies the um the

199
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,220
the board or some the VC that have

200
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,780
recently invested them are saying you

201
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,639
need to make a First Security hire and

202
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,020
there's a recruitment agency it's nice

203
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,940
nice search to work up

204
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,139
um and actually when you start meeting

205
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,620
with the CEO CTO whoever it might be

206
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,100
you you do a kickoff call and very early

207
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,100
on in that discussion it's uh we want a

208
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,380
security person and actually by the end

209
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,479
of the call they're a sales person

210
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,400
they're like they're there to like

211
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,400
support on some GRC but really it's

212
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,440
sales enablement and it's not building a

213
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,560
culture of cyber security or growing out

214
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,599
engineering working with engineering to

215
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,180
build big sdlc into the development life

216
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,639
cycle and that's kind of it's a

217
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,919
necessary evil but I'd much prefer for a

218
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,780
company to maybe use a tool to support

219
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,139
on the earlier areas of that and then

220
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,360
maybe raised get to series B and then

221
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,520
invest in their engineering function so

222
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,720
is that something that you've seen

223
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,699
throughout throughout your career

224
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,660
yeah and I just to add on that piece too

225
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,180
um if you are in need if like you if

226
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,440
you're bored or somebody's coming to you

227
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,060
say hey we absolutely have to do these

228
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,800
things it still may not be the right

229
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,720
call to to hire a security person

230
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,060
immediately at that point there are

231
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,979
firms that are due like outsourced

232
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,020
security as a service

233
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,240
um it can be your like CSO For Hire kind

234
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,740
of thing CSO as a service kind of thing

235
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,780
and like that's not a bad thing for a

236
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,460
very small company that's still trying

237
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,660
to get it like hey you need to check

238
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,699
some boxes in order to sell some stuff

239
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,680
like that's not a bad thing and then

240
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,259
obviously as you get bigger should 100

241
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,319
hire at least one security engineer

242
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,419
um to actually uh do this stuff but yeah

243
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,039
to be honest I think leveraging

244
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,659
companies like that actually make the

245
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,458
first but being the first Security hire

246
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,958
a lot easier because you come in and

247
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,458
somebody kind of already understands

248
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,380
what's going on or there's an infosec

249
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,299
policy or some some something you can

250
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,320
follow as opposed to just getting

251
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,459
plopped in the middle of this product

252
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:45,959
and they're like all right discover

253
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,959
everything in 90 days

254
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,899
like oh that's not happening yeah

255
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,279
good stuff

256
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,140
um this could be a bit of a spicy take

257
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,880
depending on people's different career

258
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,060
paths um but typically what would you

259
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,180
say individually you think is the I

260
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,899
guess the right type of profile for a

261
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,620
series b2c technology company so SAS

262
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,880
technology company and I'm sure there's

263
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,660
going to be a lot of Depends here

264
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,459
um but yeah the first typical hire the

265
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,500
profile or the background that they

266
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,360
would have had and kind of the

267
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,860
experience that they have to take on

268
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,660
that first security role head of

269
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,740
security whatever that looks like

270
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,560
um I would just I would always go for a

271
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,240
I would call them a standard security

272
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,580
engineer and so when I say engineer this

273
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,339
is somebody who codes and has a lot of

274
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,640
developer and Engineering empathy

275
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,700
um you know it it depends

276
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,080
um I think it depends on the space that

277
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,360
you're operating in and where most of

278
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,040
your problems are but if I had to pick

279
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,660
without knowing anything I'd probably

280
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,240
like maybe get yourself a cloud security

281
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,399
engineer who has

282
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,860
um talent and appsec as well so they can

283
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,940
do dual

284
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,380
um if you know if your company's 15

285
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,959
people there's no room for somebody to

286
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,600
just say I only do Cloud security and I

287
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,240
don't do anything else I never on call I

288
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,220
can't help with closing deals you should

289
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,660
fire that person or just not hire them

290
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,060
in the first place but I'm thinking that

291
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,220
their Cloud security is probably a mess

292
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,740
and then start working up the the

293
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,080
abstract pieces of it yeah 100 degree

294
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,720
some type of security generalist is

295
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,279
needed as kind of your first hire

296
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,080
somebody who's not afraid of getting

297
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,540
their hands dirty you know you want

298
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,660
somebody who's definitely

299
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,800
way more of an icy individual

300
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,600
contributor than like a manager type

301
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,459
stuff you want somebody who is not

302
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,140
afraid to work very closely with the

303
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,760
engineering in fact I'd say it's very

304
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,920
critical that the better the

305
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,300
relationship that you build with your

306
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,000
engineering team now when you're small

307
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,160
it's going to make your life so much

308
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,320
better in the future because you know

309
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,600
you don't you always hear of the like oh

310
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,700
security maybe do that or security said

311
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,000
no type stuff well if you if it's a a

312
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,399
partnership you know collaboration from

313
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,620
day one then like that makes things so

314
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,480
much easier because in the end they

315
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
learn this and then they just do the

316
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,480
right thing from uh without you having

317
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,700
to say anything it's magical and I'm

318
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,980
gonna Echo again something that the

319
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,500
concept Colleen said is that uh

320
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,079
technical chops are awesome and being

321
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,459
able to dive deep into technical things

322
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:21,720
and doing things are awesome but the

323
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,640
communication skills are also incredibly

324
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,560
important especially early on because

325
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,160
you're going to be building

326
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,480
relationships you're going to talk the

327
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,500
customers you're going to be doing all

328
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,600
sorts of other things and if you're just

329
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,920
like you know the security troll under

330
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
the bridge right nobody you're not going

331
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,700
to be successful right you're not going

332
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,860
to be able to to to be valuable to the

333
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,720
business you're in so

334
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,700
security control uh troll can be your

335
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,040
second higher

336
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,540
third third all right third because you

337
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,040
need the second hire to communicate for

338
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,279
the third diplomat

339
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,060
good stuff well pretty consistently

340
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,399
engineering right yeah that's what I'm

341
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,019
hearing uh there's a really great panel

342
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,300
conversation I uh came into earlier uh

343
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,519
today actually in this room and um it

344
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,839
was pretty consistently talking around

345
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,240
the reporting line which we could spend

346
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
a lot of time doing that so we'll we'll

347
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,079
move away from that question but it was

348
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,279
pretty consistently saying that it

349
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,320
should report into the the office of the

350
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,899
CTO VP of engineering and I think that I

351
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,880
think each and every one of you feel the

352
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,560
same way based on kind of a reporting

353
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,579
line

354
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:24,120
good stuff well um ahead of today

355
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,760
um I asked I asked everybody a question

356
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,200
um which was

357
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,899
um what would what would you advise your

358
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,839
first four hires to be so you've got the

359
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,279
hot seat you just started a security

360
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,579
program you're excited you're kind of uh

361
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,920
thinking about what those four four

362
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,959
hires look like as you're bullying out

363
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,380
the road map and um I got them to DM me

364
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,760
individually so I thought we'd have a

365
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,200
little bit of fun

366
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,820
um this afternoon if you've worked with

367
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,339
people on this panel uh please get

368
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,200
involved and think how they would think

369
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,120
about those first four hires but I'm

370
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
going to open up a couple of envelopes

371
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,180
and we'll we'll see I'd also like for

372
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,040
you all to try and get each other a

373
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,660
little bit so if that's okay yeah so

374
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,180
I'll open what's under envelope one

375
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,230
well that one's read

376
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,360
[Laughter]

377
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,260
I think the answer is it depends yeah

378
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,120
I did write that ahead yeah it

379
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,459
definitely depends as a variance um so

380
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:18,420
there's going to be a kind of a little

381
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,760
bit of nuance to each of these but who

382
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,380
is this

383
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,480
um first hire this is a little bit of a

384
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,120
spicy one but I I get why

385
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
um so a senior staff level engineer

386
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,800
infra or back end with a little bit of

387
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,880
cloud experience second hire a staff

388
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,339
level application security engineer or

389
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,660
appsec lead third hire infrasac or

390
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,700
appsec it's probably better than our

391
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,279
faces isn't it

392
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:49,440
and then fourth hire a security manager

393
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,380
supporting on the it security

394
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,480
um perspective they put in Brackets I'd

395
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,519
be looking for a bias for security

396
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,620
software Engineers over anything else

397
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,820
oh

398
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,900
no

399
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,060
[Laughter]

400
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,220
yeah that was me

401
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,920
going to talk about it yeah I hear your

402
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,200
thought process right yeah

403
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,339
um I mean we kind of talked about this a

404
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,320
little bit earlier but uh somebody who

405
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,880
just comes in and focus is purely on

406
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,200
like I'm just going to look at the code

407
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,700
nothing else is probably not going to be

408
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,920
super useful as this first hire

409
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,139
in my experience having somebody who has

410
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,060
enough experience or like exposure to

411
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,399
cloud and infrastructure can help with

412
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,380
most of the back end stuff if they're a

413
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,639
software engineer they can help with

414
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,740
some of the code if not the majority of

415
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,940
it and then

416
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,339
typically the tool sets in like Cloud

417
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,260
management and whatnot are very similar

418
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,940
to like the I.T security side of things

419
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,860
so you can get kind of that generalist

420
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,720
out there while having deeper experience

421
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,160
in like the cloud and infrastructure

422
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,320
where things can like really really go

423
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,600
wrong I think especially if you have a

424
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,740
product that's out there you already

425
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,360
probably have people hacking on the

426
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,680
front end so people are emailing

427
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,079
security at if they found books anyways

428
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,699
we have a bug Bounty program maybe

429
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,100
they're doing that but um most of the

430
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,940
time you're not getting a lot of

431
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,220
exposure to what kind of flaws you can

432
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,880
have in the back end

433
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,060
thanks Kevin Tristan all right

434
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,740
no let's keep let's keep going I want to

435
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,120
see where people go and then we'll get

436
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,880
spicy yeah if we get spicy dollars this

437
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,019
is good

438
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,760
um so first hire Cloud security engineer

439
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,420
second appsec engineer third cert

440
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,860
engineer

441
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,079
and then fourth higher depending on the

442
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,399
need

443
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,260
um you'd start based on one two and

444
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,360
three wherever the gaps are

445
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,800
um then I had to quote some of this

446
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,660
because it was great I would expect a

447
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,440
lot of uh working collaboratively and a

448
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,459
lot of crossover across different

449
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,160
functions non and this is a great line

450
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,440
none of that it's my department

451
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,480
uh a little bit of a spicy take they

452
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,940
don't need a GRC person but to have your

453
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,380
engineers that can support on different

454
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,920
tools like drata or vanta who do we

455
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,399
think that is

456
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,180
was it the BS that gave it away I guess

457
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,920
I don't play poker with you all because

458
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,639
I'll just lose

459
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,339
um okay yeah so then you know um I do

460
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:19,199
think you know your Cloud second appsec

461
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,720
that's an that's a dynamic duo

462
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,339
um and at some point there have already

463
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,380
been incidents maybe nobody knew about

464
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,540
them and so a certain person does need

465
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,300
to come in there but I would say as a

466
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,279
caveat like that if it's a very small

467
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,320
company like please have your cert

468
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,459
person

469
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:37,500
um be able to code like they should be a

470
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,600
combo of like detection engineer slash

471
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,920
cert

472
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,600
um and should be figuring out ways like

473
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,540
how do I not make myself crazy

474
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,100
um I need to make this so that it's

475
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,600
everyone's responsibility when they

476
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,160
build something and it causes a problem

477
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,380
I have to take care of it like they

478
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,899
should get tired of that quickly

479
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,940
um and then imbue knowledge on the rest

480
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,380
of the folks

481
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,759
um and then when it comes to person

482
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,639
number four it would be time for maybe

483
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,559
even the team itself to evaluate like do

484
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,819
we need more help when it comes to

485
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,199
appsec

486
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,059
um how's our education like could we

487
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,980
benefit from having another like person

488
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,660
four being you know abstract person

489
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,660
number two and really making sure that

490
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,819
everybody understands what secure coding

491
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,500
is like and maybe even getting to your

492
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,119
sales engineering organization and

493
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,520
putting them through secure coding

494
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,859
um just get everybody just again it's

495
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:28,020
push the curse of security person onto

496
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,419
as many people as possible if they're

497
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,820
already fairly aware I was fortunate

498
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,200
enough to work at a company segment

499
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,840
where before we came in they had done

500
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,179
some stuff they already preconditioned

501
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,100
themselves to hear what we had to say

502
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,780
and we're looking for our approval

503
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,660
constantly which was bizarre it was a

504
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,100
great experience to have but I'd never

505
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,520
had that before and so we we decided

506
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,679
that doubling down on education would be

507
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:54,299
really helpful because people wanted to

508
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,400
sit in those classes they got mad if

509
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,500
they missed something if they you know

510
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,860
went the CTF was over too soon

511
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,260
again bizarre but I hope each one of you

512
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,820
gets one of those experiences where

513
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,559
people love the security team and

514
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,000
everything that's being taught so much

515
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,280
because it validates you you'll want to

516
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,919
come back for more and as far as the the

517
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,200
GRC

518
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,660
I'm I'm mixed on this because I do see

519
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,080
the need for it but uh I

520
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,000
I would shake my head at a team that's

521
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,720
like 40 50 GRC that's what they do and

522
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,799
the rest are like your security

523
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,260
Engineers because there are some great

524
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,940
tools out there as I mentioned in the

525
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,480
note vanta and andrata which will allow

526
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,100
the existing security Engineers to go

527
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,480
through like if you know your sales team

528
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,280
is putting pressure and saying we need

529
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,620
to get sock 2 type 2 how do we do that

530
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,559
you don't go paper the certification

531
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,539
it's not about the check boxes and it's

532
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:50,520
not about looking compliant and like

533
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,380
looking secure it's actually about being

534
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,059
secure and I think your security

535
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,799
Engineers are going to do a better job

536
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,000
overall than us than a GRC team you do

537
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,679
have to check the boxes but it has to

538
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,840
mean something it actually has to be it

539
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,179
can't be performative and so I'd say

540
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,039
hold off and maybe you don't need to

541
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,440
have 50 of your team beat GRC so sorry

542
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,679
GRC people but that's how I feel

543
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,600
what I liked about that answer as well

544
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,820
and we touched on it earlier today as

545
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,000
well in a conversation but it was um it

546
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,460
was whilst kind of the the different

547
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,559
roles or in different skill sets just

548
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,840
having the crossover and having the kind

549
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,200
of the startup mindset of where multiple

550
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,940
hats like ideally you'll have a

551
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,400
generalist but in if you if you don't

552
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,299
you're trying to get different

553
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,160
disciplines that it's not just about the

554
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,900
skill set but it's the attitude kind of

555
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,640
the willing to take on extra

556
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,799
responsibilities wear multiple hats and

557
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,960
have that kind of startup move fast

558
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,120
break things kind of mindset

559
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,340
cool down to two more people all right

560
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,360
uh this one is first first hire I mean

561
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,799
this is exactly what the person's done

562
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,840
very recently so just look at this link

563
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,280
to this person's LinkedIn you'll see it

564
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,559
uh so staff security engineer generalist

565
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,240
that's what we just discussed

566
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,539
um second hire security engineer senior

567
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,220
um third detection response security

568
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,100
engineer fourth interesting one

569
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,799
operations analyst

570
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,419
um and then the side note is I want

571
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,760
system thinkers excellent communicators

572
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,799
and people that have strong operational

573
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,419
skills

574
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,580
any guesses

575
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,919
who said Mike yeah that's right yeah

576
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,059
it's Mike yeah

577
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:31,140
the sum up for that is like especially

578
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,700
when you get down on the bottom it

579
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,200
really depends on what your company

580
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,179
needs right

581
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,340
um like you might need someone to go

582
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,840
communicate out to customers right you

583
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,660
might need someone to sit down and do it

584
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,059
operations or to do some other type of

585
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:46,200
operational work you might need more

586
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,580
vulnerability management it's just it

587
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,220
really really depends uh the key thing

588
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,539
for me though is like that that first

589
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,100
hire

590
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,760
um

591
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,460
you need someone to bounce ideas off of

592
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,380
you need someone who is enough of a

593
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,820
generalist who's senior enough where you

594
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,860
can be like hey I think this is a

595
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,419
problem or I think this is a crazy idea

596
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,340
what do you think and be able to have

597
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,140
those conversations right not someone

598
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,520
you can detect down to you need someone

599
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,080
who's going to dictate back right back

600
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,299
at you that I think is really important

601
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,410
[Laughter]

602
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,959
I did

603
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,380
technically I didn't steal them

604
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,460
technically Tom stole them for me so Tom

605
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,640
this got real awkward real quick

606
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,120
she just all worked with code red

607
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,799
uh good stuff any guesses until the

608
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,380
fourth person could be right

609
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,539
so Reed went with a strong security

610
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,120
generalist his first hire application

611
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,840
project engineer third hire clouds Sac

612
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,799
infra engineer fourth I.T security and

613
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,020
if he had a fifth it would be on the GRC

614
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,760
side of things so you want to walk us

615
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,640
through that yeah I mean I think that uh

616
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,159
a generalist is the number one person

617
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,360
that you need

618
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,280
um and so somebody can wear lots of hats

619
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,260
because as we've talked about earlier

620
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,900
like the you won't just be just doing

621
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,240
the engineering stuff it is very common

622
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,220
that you're gonna be put on sales calls

623
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,380
to talk about the security of the

624
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,940
product and so you need to be able to

625
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,440
communicate you need to be able to do

626
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,580
lots of things across the organization

627
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,679
um but then you need you know once you

628
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,480
have that person then it's like okay now

629
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,860
there's certain key areas that you

630
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,840
really need to focus on um do you know

631
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,480
this the appsec pride sec uh type of

632
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,159
things looking at the application itself

633
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,200
and then also you know the cloud Tech

634
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,460
infrasex so looking at your

635
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,020
infrastructure and sometimes those

636
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,520
things can very much overlap sometimes

637
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,260
they're very different depends on the

638
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,820
company and what your the product or

639
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,799
Services uh that are

640
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,140
um and then I would say once you kind of

641
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,240
have those three and and the order kind

642
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,100
of again can vary matter but uh but like

643
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,280
the kind of Corp it says I include like

644
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,580
DNR kind of stuff in that uh wheelbarrow

645
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,659
as well

646
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:05,820
um just to focus on like okay what's the

647
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,559
back of the house thing like what is

648
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,659
your actual corporate infrastructure you

649
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,700
know how are you just keeping all your

650
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,280
employees actually secure how are you

651
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,840
detecting if there's an issue and such

652
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,020
from there and again on the the fifth

653
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,299
bonus uh would be like okay if you get

654
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,000
to that point and like say that it's

655
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
it's becoming an issue where you're

656
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,059
spending a lot of time dealing with like

657
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,919
customer security questionnaires or

658
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,960
dealing with compliance things or your

659
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,460
sales team is saying like hey we have to

660
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,580
get XYZ thing to sell type stuff it is

661
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,340
nice to have a GRC person to help out

668
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,440
um and now you've got to go to market

669
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,720
I'd love for each of you to walk through

670
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,580
your kind of like General philosophy

671
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,500
you're all experienced hiring managers

672
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,900
you've hired at multiple places now and

673
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,419
you have hired pretty much all that all

674
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,240
those different skill sets so what is

675
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,400
your general philosophy and how do you

676
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,380
go about

677
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,320
um recruiting experience security hires

678
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,600
maybe start with start with Mike

679
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,640
oh cool all right

680
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,299
um yeah so I

681
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:22,860
roll the roll depends

682
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,360
um in terms of the technical experience

683
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,400
uh you look at what they've done where

684
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,659
they've worked what scale they've worked

685
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:28,559
out

686
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,000
um what their what their capabilities

687
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,220
are what they bring to the table but

688
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,140
especially early on I filter pretty hard

689
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,640
on uh personality types uh you know

690
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,500
people who can just sit down roll up

691
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,059
their sleeves go go and get to work

692
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,100
people who don't like causing drama

693
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,539
people are good communicators people who

694
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:47,059
can work together well

695
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:49,880
and essentially building that that

696
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,840
structure where their psychological

697
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,940
safety inside the team so people can

698
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,440
feel and able to go out and get awesome

699
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,059
work done

700
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,100
um and early on like when you're making

701
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,780
first higher secondary third higher

702
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,700
right like every single person has such

703
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,620
an outsized impact on that as the team

704
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,620
grows you got to get it right

705
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,299
yeah plus one to all that and I think

706
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,799
one of the things that a lot of people

707
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,960
as the first or even second or third or

708
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,700
fourth or whatever higher don't realize

709
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,919
is they have fairly outsized impact on

710
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,900
how the rest of the organization views

711
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,880
and interacts with security they've kind

712
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,320
of all worked on a team where people

713
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,820
like oh I don't I'm going to avoid

714
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,080
security I don't really want to talk to

715
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,460
them they just tell me no all the time

716
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,900
like all these things that you don't

717
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,820
want like well I would be my friend you

718
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,440
know like these people you bring in if

719
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,179
they're not good communicators they'll

720
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:34,740
set up the department to know right if

721
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,659
they're not uh empathetic and

722
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:38,279
approachable like you'll end up with a

723
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,440
team where you know whenever you have a

724
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,520
senior leader comes in who's just gonna

725
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,080
have to undo all that culture and it's

726
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,120
really really hard to undo like a

727
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,400
negative culture and they persist kind

728
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,320
of all over the place and so focusing on

729
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,640
that a lot you know technical ability

730
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,500
aside and things I think makes a lot of

731
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,779
sense such that you set up the rest of

732
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,340
the lifespan of your company for success

733
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,080
in the security space

734
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,140
yeah uh I think that so I'll talk about

735
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,000
somebody who you all probably know who

736
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,919
this person is I think this person was

737
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,860
my first hire at segment um there was

738
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,440
someone who came in before me but

739
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,480
um

740
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,760
like very very very carefully pick your

741
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,059
early crew because they are like the DNA

742
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,220
which the rest of the crew is going to

743
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,400
sort of inherit and the person who I

744
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,039
ended up hiring is you know was a

745
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,659
self-starter

746
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,179
um wanted to get good in all aspects of

747
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:32,340
security engineering was willing to work

748
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,620
hard did work hard but more importantly

749
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,480
was like you know what security people

750
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,340
want they want to work with a bunch of

751
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,919
other security people who don't suck

752
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,059
they were out of work at a company that

753
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,159
doesn't suck they want Executives to

754
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,020
support they and so the only way you can

755
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,539
advertise if you have that situation is

756
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,980
the security team actually has to go

757
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,200
tell other security people we actually

758
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,179
do have a great situation let me tell

759
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,340
you about our CEO let me tell you about

760
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,440
you know our relationship with the sres

761
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,179
they love us

762
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,820
um and this person uh who is famous for

763
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,880
wearing Hawaiian shirts

764
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,120
who could it be I don't know and at one

765
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,159
time was a dead ringer for was it Tom

766
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,279
sell like in the 80s

767
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,640
so this person was yes like partnered

768
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,580
with all of us to um you found out a

769
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,440
thing you struggled with a thing we have

770
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,299
you know in sort of internal or external

771
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:28,080
message write about it get up on stage

772
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
um let's tell the rest of the company

773
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,200
about it let's tell the rest of the

774
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,000
community about it and so we were able

775
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,340
to create this culture where

776
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,960
um all the stuff we were working on even

777
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,640
though we may have had imposter syndrome

778
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,260
like yeah every security person goes

779
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,580
through this why would anybody care

780
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,500
about this people do want to hear from

781
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,059
you and your team and what's your

782
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,980
experience working with one another what

783
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,600
interesting problems you have and what

784
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,980
support you have from the rest of the

785
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,720
company because everyone's worked at a

786
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,279
terrible company where there are

787
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,659
terrible Executives and terrible

788
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,400
engineers and a terrible relationship

789
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,100
and you get up every day to fight this

790
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,500
fight and you know you're losing

791
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,440
um so we we decided to advertise the

792
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,559
situation that we had which was we had a

793
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,659
great situation everybody was pre-sold

794
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,940
and how many times does a security get

795
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,039
to work at a company where

796
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,600
um you know maybe you are able to get

797
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,059
your appsec to optimizing level five you

798
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,159
know it's something we dream about and

799
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,840
having the team go out and talk about

800
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,080
that attracted excellent people and so

801
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,460
we had excellent people attracting

802
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,900
excellent people attracting excellent

803
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,179
people and before we knew it it's like

804
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,340
okay this is the best team I've ever

805
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,580
worked on I'm feeling insecure so

806
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,559
um so yeah pick that pick that small

807
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,779
family really really carefully

808
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:41,700
plus one to all of that the only thing I

809
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,740
would add is that referrals are key

810
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:47,940
um I just like you know use your network

811
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,799
um besides is a great place for this you

812
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,900
you meet people here and and other

813
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,580
conferences too

814
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,220
um and that that is key otherwise you

815
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,900
get tons of resumes sent into all your

816
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,580
things filtering that people can sound

817
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,860
good in a resume it can mean nothing it

818
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,100
is a a referral just means so much

819
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,860
yes yeah especially within your network

820
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,100
um I think to add one more thing and for

821
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,080
each actually all of you

822
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,840
um individually is just the kind of all

823
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,880
these leaders that have built great

824
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,679
teams is because of everything they've

825
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,020
just mentioned but each of them go above

826
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,059
and beyond to give back pay forward

827
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,620
whatever term you kind of want to use

828
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,260
and just a little plug or a thank you to

829
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,340
each of you

830
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,840
um Kevin's been on the careers Village

831
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,580
all weekend just spending time doing

832
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,220
interviews back to back and uh both uh

833
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,200
Mike and Colleen have just effortlessly

834
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,179
given their time and that isn't today

835
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,520
it's it's every event it's given their

836
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,080
time all the time

837
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,020
um to help others out and redoes this

838
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,520
whole event every year which is pretty

839
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,100
freaking cool so yeah it's it's it's

840
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,679
it's doing all those things but also

841
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,240
kind of just continue to part the

842
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,220
community and the reason why referrals

843
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,659
are so key is because you're part of

844
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,760
this community people want to reach out

845
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,440
and and they're friends and friends want

846
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,240
to reach out as well

847
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,500
um the other thing I wanted to I like

848
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,820
just to tag on to the question around

849
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,140
hiring

850
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,580
um is throughout this whole weekend

851
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,500
there's a lot of experienced people with

852
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,840
great stories and incredible talks and

853
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,399
that we've seen over the weekend but

854
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,500
there seems to be a lot of people

855
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,200
um that because of riffs and layoffs and

856
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,820
all that kind of fun stuff there's a lot

857
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,260
of people that maybe are graduates or

858
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,700
coming from unconventional backgrounds

859
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,260
they're struggling to get that kind of

860
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,940
foot in the door I guess and land their

861
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,039
first security role or maybe they've

862
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,100
been in a more kind of devops role and

863
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,140
trying to transition have any of you

864
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,600
hired kind of unconventionally on that

865
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,700
path and if so could you give us

866
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,620
um some examples of that

867
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,840
I love hiring unconventionally

868
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,159
um I actually think that a lot of these

869
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,659
skill sets that are in other areas of

870
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:46,860
engineering translate really well into

871
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,440
security like devops and SRE are really

872
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,659
really great for uh incident response

873
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,600
teams quite frequently and so

874
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,039
one of the things I say quite frequently

875
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,299
is like if you have like years of

876
00:30:57,299 --> 00:30:58,799
experience doing that I can teach you

877
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,799
how to think like an which is

878
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,820
basically what security people do right

879
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,340
put on the hat and fix whatever

880
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,659
problem that's going to be like that's

881
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,220
not that hard as long as you're still

882
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,320
nice while you're doing it but uh like

883
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,059
so converting folks uh security

884
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,039
Engineers from devops and SRE I think is

885
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,500
great uh I've worked with several

886
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,940
Engineers who are like full stack

887
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,080
developers or just kind of core

888
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,460
Developers for a majority of their

889
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,200
career and then over time they develop

890
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,340
an interest in things like

891
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,440
authentication and authorization just by

892
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,899
by way of being in close proxy needs

893
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,460
some of these things and then you pull

894
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,200
those folks in too same sort of deal

895
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,520
like I can teach you to think like an

896
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,200
attacker you already have this deep

897
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,000
experience in some other area and the

898
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,980
reality is is like most of us are just

899
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,419
working on the same stuff anyways and

900
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,140
slap some security on it so having skill

901
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,179
sets and experience in other areas then

902
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,100
coming in and bringing that experience

903
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,020
and your exposure to other engineering

904
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,360
teams and how we do things at X company

905
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,220
or Y company really really helps you

906
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,380
build kind of a well-rounded uh

907
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,000
General's team about like how do we

908
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,279
approach security for this company and

909
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,659
the way they make sense for us not

910
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:03,899
necessarily what everybody else is doing

911
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,240
I'll just add on to that so if for the

912
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,980
folks that are still in students or in

913
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,720
Academia or something like that uh

914
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,460
something that I think a couple of

915
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,200
things that I think are really good that

916
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,720
you can do one uh contribute to open

917
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,059
source um make a name for yourself in

918
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:19,860
that uh there's so many different

919
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,059
projects out there it doesn't even have

920
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,340
to be security specific but just

921
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,500
starting to figure out that out and

922
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,299
especially since nowadays everybody

923
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,279
lives in some type of git-like

924
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,679
environment like you get uh you learn

925
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,539
very early on about kind of like good

926
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:35,460
practices you know getting peer review

927
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,559
poor doing pull requests flows or

928
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,240
whatever you know your your tool is

929
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,760
doing there I think is very valuable and

930
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,799
then also like Capture the Flag type

931
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,419
events

932
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,880
um and there's tons out there that you

933
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,159
can do including here at besides

934
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,140
um that kind of help you build that kind

935
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,360
of security mindset that you can do from

936
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,640
very early on and cost you nothing

937
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,380
um so that's those are ways that you

938
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,279
know if you're trying to learn Security

939
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,840
on a budget

940
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,279
um that free ways that you can do that

941
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,020
on your own time

942
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,720
yeah just I mean I think all has already

943
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,539
been said but um the one Craig caveat is

944
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:11,580
this the Market's not really great right

945
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,919
now so people who are just graduating

946
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,360
and maybe they're an accounting major

947
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,100
and they're like give me a security job

948
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,720
that's not going to happen

949
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,700
um they need to do some work um again

950
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,159
like ctfs uh there's plenty of like

951
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:25,200
learn to code online if they can afford

952
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,260
it coding bootcamp would be great but I

953
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,700
don't think that you can just show up

954
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,059
and say I am a human and you have you

955
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:35,100
know a job opening for a senior engineer

956
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,299
will you hire me it's not going to

957
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,760
happen like that so I think nowadays a

958
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,500
new grad or someone who's completely

959
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,880
changing

960
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,679
um needs to show that they put in some

961
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,320
work first because companies are not

962
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,019
that desperate to hire anymore so that

963
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:50,700
means the level of work needs to go up

964
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,640
on the side of the person who's looking

965
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,860
the the last thing I'd say that I say to

966
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,059
like everybody who asked me this

967
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:00,059
question is uh go out and make friends a

968
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:04,799
network like it's the Go I mean like it

969
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,880
doesn't even have to be the good ones

970
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,440
like they're like San Francisco was

971
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,599
awesome right but like go to your local

972
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,739
isaka right whatever right no no y'all

973
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:17,399
are terrible don't know uh no I'm sorry

974
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:18,839
um but no like there's some groups like

975
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,480
I live in South Texas and our local uh

976
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,060
issm and Issa and and whatever

977
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,679
professional groups they're like they're

978
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,659
they're kind of buttoned up right the

979
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,339
race stay the right whatever

980
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:32,339
but go to them anyway right go meet the

981
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:33,659
people see what interests them figure

982
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,119
out the lingo talk to people be out

983
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,619
there be present

984
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,359
um and start figuring out what people

985
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,560
are looking for what they're interested

986
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,119
in what they want

987
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,679
um and that is what is going to make

988
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,159
your career

989
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,179
thank you

990
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,099
um we saw I asked to start this

991
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,320
conversation today if there's any kind

992
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,359
of new hire managers or people kind of

993
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:55,918
starting their Journey as a first head

994
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,119
of security or something along those

995
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,380
lines

996
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,420
um you've all kind of built out Security

997
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,180
Programs and teams I guess for new hire

998
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,740
managers and I think I will believe

999
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,920
there's many in the room today that are

1000
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,440
excited to hear kind of see you feedback

1001
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,359
what advice would you give to people

1002
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:14,520
that are starting to to hire and

1003
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,220
thinking about building a team

1004
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,020
high or slow

1005
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,180
like take take your time to make that

1006
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,520
call be very intentional about it and

1007
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,099
then also focus on doing hiringly if you

1008
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:27,300
get head count you're like yeah yeah I

1009
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,740
just got problems to solve a higher

1010
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,380
later that's going to backfire on you or

1011
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,760
if you feel it really fast that will

1012
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,859
probably also backfire on you to be very

1013
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,540
intentional about hiring and you do it

1014
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,820
in a slow way such that you can

1015
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,079
get all the things you're looking for

1016
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,640
right communication style and empathy

1017
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,560
and everything else then you can start

1018
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,440
to build that core set of folks in a

1019
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,040
very intentional way but um higher slow

1020
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,839
just to add on that point I mean

1021
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,460
recruiting is probably the most

1022
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,020
important thing that you do it's

1023
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,579
actually more important than actually

1024
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,740
solving the security problems yes

1025
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,740
um and so I agree entirely with hiring

1026
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,000
slow

1027
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,180
um take your time make sure that again

1028
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,119
back to the early conversation uh these

1029
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,160
initial hires that you're you're hiring

1030
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,920
have such an outsized influence on the

1031
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,020
organization if they are not right it

1032
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,359
hurts things could be for the for the

1033
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:20,099
life of the company really

1034
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:21,780
um so you really want to make sure

1035
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,700
you're doing that hiring the right

1036
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,640
people to start with

1037
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,400
that's a it's a privilege to be able to

1038
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,880
hire everybody from scratch if you if

1039
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,920
your head count is zero and you show a

1040
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,720
plan to whoever is going to fund you and

1041
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,040
they're like yeah go ahead and do it

1042
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,920
again high or slow that's the DNA pool

1043
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,780
that you care about

1044
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,660
um and if it turns out poorly then you

1045
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,339
have only yourself to blame because you

1046
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,800
didn't have high standards consistent

1047
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,359
standards

1048
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,820
um but uh it's it's a great position to

1049
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,980
be in so don't squander that opportunity

1050
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,160
as opposed to you go to a company and

1051
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,380
there's already you know hundreds or

1052
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,420
whatever of people there who work for

1053
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,560
you

1054
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,000
um that's a very different type of

1055
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,680
situation because a lot of Performance

1056
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,180
Management that has to happen right out

1057
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,040
the gate but if you are given that

1058
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,380
privilege to hire from scratch take it

1059
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,420
very seriously make sure that early on

1060
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,760
you have job ladders for your security

1061
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,400
people so if you happen to be really

1062
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,140
good and pick the best people out there

1063
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,720
a year later how do they get promoted

1064
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,480
how do you ensure consistency

1065
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,920
um how closely related are your job

1066
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,500
ladders to the rest of engineering

1067
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,440
um you know what do 360 reviews look

1068
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,380
like between engineering and security

1069
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,420
um but uh but yeah don't squander that

1070
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,920
opportunity at some point don't just

1071
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,960
hire somebody who's breathing and says

1072
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,960
the word security but will regret it

1073
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,180
I wouldn't sit there like Dad that oh

1074
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,760
sorry no go go does that recruiting will

1075
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,619
take a lot of your time

1076
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,720
um and so expect that like you're not

1077
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,040
going to get other things done so when

1078
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,119
you're doing like your quarterly

1079
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,820
planning like recruiting is a large

1080
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,859
chunk of that and so like yeah you may

1081
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,480
not get the actual Tech or security

1082
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,400
stuff done because you're spending all

1083
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,260
your time reviewing things doing phone

1084
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,180
screens doing coding challenges whatever

1085
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,060
with people that is going to take up a

1086
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,320
very large chunk of your time more than

1087
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,660
half your week yeah yeah yeah

1088
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,099
the only thing I will say is if you're

1089
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,359
doing this for the very first time

1090
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,160
please for the love of God have people

1091
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,599
that aren't on the security team on your

1092
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,880
interview Loop

1093
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,040
and a diverse interview Loop that too

1094
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,599
absolutely

1095
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,220
good stuff

1096
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,599
um I guess one more question that I have

1097
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,940
which is kind of related is

1098
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,220
um I did a panel actually besides last

1099
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,660
year which was a very different Market

1100
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,520
where you just couldn't hire great stuff

1101
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,320
because everyone was moving a million

1102
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,240
miles an hour we do find ourselves uh

1103
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,740
Colleen mentioned it earlier I found

1104
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,760
ourselves in a slightly different market

1105
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,320
so I think there's a lot of people right

1106
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,660
now that are hurt and grateful to be in

1107
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,740
roles but top performers how how do each

1108
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,619
of you retain top performers

1109
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,200
um within the business

1110
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,300
well I mean I'll just dovetail off my

1111
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,040
own answer which is make sure that

1112
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,380
performance is taken into consideration

1113
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,900
because those top performers won't hang

1114
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,820
around if you don't have your crap

1115
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,339
together when it comes to how do I

1116
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:15,960
evaluate an ic3 versus ic4 or five

1117
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,780
um yeah they we were big Believers in

1118
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,119
creating Career Development plans that

1119
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,619
were based off of those letters so a

1120
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,180
person could see exactly where their

1121
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,640
gaps were how much work they needed to

1122
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,140
do and if there were other people in the

1123
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,820
company that needed to validate that

1124
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,619
those behaviors had changed or that

1125
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,980
impact was there we tried to be as

1126
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,480
crystal clear as possible we didn't get

1127
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,820
to it as often as we wanted but we had

1128
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,040
to put something down because if if you

1129
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,440
if your answer to those folks is like I

1130
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,240
don't feel like you're ready for

1131
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,440
promotion

1132
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,140
that's a huge mistake I never had to fix

1133
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,480
it work a weekend to get something

1134
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,040
um like put together for that because

1135
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,660
you will lose good people if they don't

1136
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,640
get good feedback

1137
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,980
um and then also don't be afraid to give

1138
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,780
people tough feedback I think on a

1139
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,160
regular basis you need to be telling

1140
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,619
them how am I doing how do other teams

1141
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,540
react to you how they how are they

1142
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,040
receiving you what's the actual impact

1143
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,839
of the work that you're doing and so

1144
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,119
everyone can start viewing themselves as

1145
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,180
a product as well as an employee because

1146
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,099
the stuff that I do I'm putting it out

1147
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,280
here for evaluation and if somebody

1148
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,300
criticizes this product that I put out

1149
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,500
there I shouldn't feel personally

1150
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,740
criticized but if my manager never has

1151
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,240
these conversations with me the very

1152
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,160
first time that happens after a year

1153
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,780
it's going to feel like an attack so

1154
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,700
create this culture of feedback based

1155
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,380
off of the career development plans that

1156
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,599
you create basically having no surprises

1157
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,660
policy is the way I think about it and I

1158
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,460
think during your 101s don't just have

1159
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,920
them solely project focused like you

1160
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,079
actually need to talk about and dedicate

1161
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,480
time to to the career aspect as well and

1162
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,220
like hey how are you doing how can we

1163
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,500
get you to the next level what is what

1164
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,180
does that look like

1165
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,420
um how do we you know again as managers

1166
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,920
the goal is not to actually make the

1167
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,780
manager looks good make the IC looks

1168
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,680
good

1169
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,940
um like you want to see the manager

1170
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,560
wants to support the IC and help them

1171
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,180
along that path because in the end it'll

1172
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,460
make everybody look good if if people

1173
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,079
are getting work done and that

1174
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,060
everybody's happy with them again the

1175
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,740
best thing that you can have in a

1176
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,140
company is that people love working with

1177
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,119
your security team like that's what you

1178
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,160
want and that is a lot of companies

1179
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,000
don't have that so

1180
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,520
cool well we've got a bit of time left

1181
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,800
and I would love to open up to the floor

1182
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,599
for some questions if anybody would like

1183
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,400
to kicks off

1184
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,119
over that

1185
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,859
didn't work out as a nurse

1186
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,680
for those that didn't hear the question

1187
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,300
uh we're looking for a bit of tea uh

1188
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,859
here which is

1189
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:55,380
um uh is was there any hires that we

1190
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,180
that you've made for any of the

1191
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,780
panelists that didn't quite work out or

1192
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,339
is it is

1193
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:04,740
cool yeah and what do you do to correct

1194
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,859
that

1195
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,260
spilled vertique I'm gonna I'm gonna

1196
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,400
just go out here for

1197
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,339
here for that's that has never

1198
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:16,440
for me it's not because I'm the best at

1199
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,680
hiring it's because you know we we've

1200
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,680
who've like you know we know

1201
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,740
um higher slow have the bar Super High

1202
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,300
um and then the right people will sort

1203
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,579
of self-select into your process and

1204
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:31,140
when you have that cross-functional

1205
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,520
panel

1206
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,440
um and then all around the company like

1207
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,060
you maybe have some room for sales you

1208
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,380
have someone from legal you have people

1209
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,180
from engineering teams and product teams

1210
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,560
and they're all like this is the most

1211
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,240
amazing person

1212
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,339
um and then you're like they're okay and

1213
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:46,140
then you bring them on those people have

1214
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,300
already sold themselves on this person

1215
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,579
who you brought in which means their

1216
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:52,560
chance of success and working well with

1217
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,320
these folks has already gone up and so I

1218
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,140
think that you you de-risk it that way

1219
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,000
um there have been situations where you

1220
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,040
know if you go into a situation and

1221
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,920
you've inherited some folks

1222
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,480
um the

1223
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,640
the thing is like if you can't what you

1224
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,319
can't have as a security leader is you

1225
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,020
can't have consistent top performers who

1226
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,359
have high impact who when people think

1227
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,099
of the security team they think of like

1228
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:20,040
this handful of people and then not 43

1229
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,440
other people because those 43 other

1230
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,520
people

1231
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,099
um that weighs on your top performers

1232
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,920
because they're very aware that why is

1233
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,960
it that I hold myself to this high

1234
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,819
standard and I can deliver it and these

1235
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,500
people aren't doing anything or they're

1236
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,839
actively making things worse so that's

1237
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:39,119
the uncomfortable position for you is

1238
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,980
that then you have to go back to that

1239
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,660
the ladders you have to go back to like

1240
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,700
performance reviews peer reviews and you

1241
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,440
have to hold that group of 43

1242
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,540
accountable and you have to do it

1243
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,060
quickly because chances are when you

1244
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,980
come into that situation this situation

1245
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,319
has been as the word fomenting for a

1246
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,240
while there's like lots of resentment on

1247
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,099
the team and so if you're in the

1248
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:00,480
position to do something about it and

1249
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,359
you don't then you're allowing

1250
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,160
um either like I wouldn't even say

1251
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,380
mediocre you're allowing full Behavior

1252
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,480
to erode all the progress that the

1253
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,700
handful of good people are doing and you

1254
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,200
cannot do that that's the hardest thing

1255
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,280
about the job I'd say right yeah

1256
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,960
it's hard to inherit people that don't

1257
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,040
quite work

1258
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,800
it's it's hard but it'll happen to all

1259
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,500
Security leaders at some point

1260
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,180
the other half of higher slow is fire

1261
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,480
fast

1262
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,480
I agree I mean yeah 100 yeah promote

1263
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,920
quickest

1264
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,819
uh who's next

1265
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:43,319
great question uh for those that are at

1266
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:45,000
the back uh what makes a great

1267
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,720
performance review

1268
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,180
I like the 360 model of like you know

1269
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,060
you have uh your do some kind of

1270
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,940
self-review reflection of yourself

1271
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,160
um getting peers that you can select and

1272
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,500
maybe your manager may make sure that

1273
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,839
other people are included in that but at

1274
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,119
least have you know some peers there and

1275
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,859
then I think a key part of every 360

1276
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:11,280
review is also the um you're reviewing

1277
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,440
your manager as well because people

1278
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,760
don't leave companies people leave

1279
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,200
managers yeah

1280
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,339
um so I think that's a critical bar

1281
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,980
sound yeah and for what Colleen said

1282
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,260
also like you have to get your ladders

1283
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,540
you have to get your expectations set so

1284
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,099
you can even if you don't like refer to

1285
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,240
them and like open up the document and

1286
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,440
be like look this is the thing and you

1287
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,760
do like checklisting at least you have

1288
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,260
that reference and you know where you

1289
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,060
can say this area you're doing good this

1290
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,380
area you're doing not good this area

1291
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,119
you're doing absolutely fantastic right

1292
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:37,680
you have to have that kind of reference

1293
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,020
point uh so you can you really have

1294
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,819
reasonable discussions across the whole

1295
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:43,560
range of skill sets and the and the

1296
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,240
person writing the self review has the

1297
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,040
same information yeah yeah and it makes

1298
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,660
it way easier for them to write their

1299
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,339
self review yeah

1300
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:52,079
I think kind of a cop-out answer is like

1301
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,480
no surprises uh but the reality is if

1302
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,880
you're doing if you have like a process

1303
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,380
or a cycle of like continuous feedback

1304
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,940
people always know when they're doing

1305
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,800
well when they're not doing so well by

1306
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,420
the time you get around to performance

1307
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,440
review you're like all right here's your

1308
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,760
five minute performance review for the

1309
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,319
last whatever period all right great

1310
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:08,280
we've already been talking about the

1311
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,660
things that need to improve things I can

1312
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,460
should keep doing like what your

1313
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,380
expectations are of me you know I see

1314
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,720
the manager or manager manager right

1315
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,300
it's you end up in this world where like

1316
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,680
great thanks to review but we've already

1317
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,700
been talking about all these things

1318
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,800
continuously the whole entire time so I

1319
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,480
have active real-time feedback as to how

1320
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,040
I'm performing always and this is just

1321
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,540
an encapsulation of that feedback

1322
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,940
stuff at the back

1323
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,599
that's you

1324
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,500
know

1325
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,079
I think we all heard that yeah or do you

1326
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,079
want do you need it repeated okay sorry

1327
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:58,040
yes please repeat that

1328
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,060
it was a really long question

1329
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,920
planning yeah

1330
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,119
uh

1331
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,980
say that

1332
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,760
um

1333
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,300
and I just lost my turn Okay so just um

1334
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,220
one one thing that I rely on is it's

1335
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,020
like a cookie formula with three

1336
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,579
ingredients so it's probably not a very

1337
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:19,200
good cookie but

1338
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,619
um one one of those is I'm not a baker

1339
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:24,240
I'm more of a cook

1340
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,560
um

1341
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,599
you know where wherever you happen to be

1342
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,880
working your the company's risk profile

1343
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,380
is going to be different from the last

1344
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,780
company you were at and so you're going

1345
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,700
to come in with some like I know I need

1346
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,319
to hire these types of people because

1347
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:39,240
whatever problem we'll encounter will be

1348
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,560
able to handle it but then you're like

1349
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,599
what do we work on

1350
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,819
um the the things that I've done I mean

1351
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:46,619
you can do this if it makes sense to you

1352
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:49,200
but you need to do some sort of full-on

1353
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,960
risk assessment and I don't mean like

1354
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,300
one that would be this giant weird

1355
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,680
template that you copy from the Internet

1356
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,740
it's if again it's 20 people 25 people

1357
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,540
in your company go talk to all of them

1358
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,060
and like they all have an opinion on

1359
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,859
security they all have an opinion on the

1360
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:06,660
way they think that the that their world

1361
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,220
is going to end that the company is

1362
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,440
going to be gone and they're sitting on

1363
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,839
this information and they can't wait for

1364
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:14,460
you to just free them from it because

1365
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,839
then they can be like oh I could go

1366
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,599
about my life and now it's your problem

1367
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:20,400
um so really accumulating that

1368
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,260
information and then sharing it with as

1369
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,760
many people as you can who are decision

1370
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,920
makers and like hey we can't work on

1371
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,740
everything but um but the 25 people who

1372
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,420
work in this company are really scared

1373
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,420
to death of these things and let's get

1374
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,980
really specific what that is and you can

1375
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,599
come up with your own little customized

1376
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:38,400
risk lists and then you know if

1377
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,079
something is very scary but it's very

1378
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,540
unlikely to happen and then you're very

1379
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:44,579
articulate about why it's unlikely to

1380
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:46,440
happen you know that will help you like

1381
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,420
with what do I work on first or how much

1382
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,000
effort do I put in on it but that's the

1383
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,260
custom piece that you're going to need

1384
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,839
is like what keeps up everyone at night

1385
00:48:54,839 --> 00:48:57,240
and then that goes into your roadmap and

1386
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,220
because people have confessed it to you

1387
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:00,839
when you're like okay I'm going to

1388
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,760
repeat back this is what our roadmap is

1389
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,079
they're not going to be surprised

1390
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,000
they're like hey I told you that and I'm

1391
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,560
so grateful that we're going to be

1392
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,599
solving that I'm grateful I can lend you

1393
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:10,980
some resources so this nightmare can

1394
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,020
disappear for me so

1395
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,859
yeah I you you have to look at what your

1396
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:19,079
problems are and then decide what you're

1397
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:21,780
going to be terrible at solving

1398
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,660
and just say I don't care like we're

1399
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,099
going to be bad at this for the next

1400
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:28,880
three years and I don't care right and

1401
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,140
keep yourself honest and check in like

1402
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,760
every year to a few years or however

1403
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,040
often you need to do it but like commit

1404
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,140
to being bad at something so you can

1405
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,700
have the time to be good at the things

1406
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,740
that matter

1407
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,079
we all have the same problems like every

1408
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:44,460
company you go to you're going to have

1409
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,079
the exact same things to do with yes

1410
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,579
that may be customized for that company

1411
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:50,520
but like the every company I've gone to

1412
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,740
like there's a few key things that I'm

1413
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,900
like focused on that are like okay gotta

1414
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,540
get these areas right and yeah again I

1415
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,280
want to make sure that whatever the

1416
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,260
product or service is is dealt with but

1417
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,819
like there's some key areas they're just

1418
00:50:02,819 --> 00:50:05,040
the same in every company you go to yep

1419
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,200
unless they solved it before that's true

1420
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,880
unless they saw them because sometimes

1421
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,020
they do yeah unlikely

1422
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,940
and you'll take a day to just reflect on

1423
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,660
is this reality or my truth do I not

1424
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,359
have to deal with this this time yeah

1425
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,000
good stuff well thank you all so much

1426
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,619

1427
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:27,300
