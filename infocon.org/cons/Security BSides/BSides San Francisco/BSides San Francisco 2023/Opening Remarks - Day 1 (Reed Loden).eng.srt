um please sign up at besides sf.org jobs

167
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,319
so I want to talk about a little bit

168
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,759
about code of conduct

169
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,259
um it's it's pretty simple it's show

170
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:23,819
respect and tolerance for each other's

171
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,860
uniqueness be kind and practice the

172
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,500
Golden Rule simply put do not be an ass

173
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,419
or we'll kick your ass out that's really

174
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,000
what it boils down to so absolutely no

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,280
tolerance for physical verbal or sexual

176
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,539
harassment intimidation or

177
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,699
marginalization of any human robots are

178
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:39,780
okay though

179
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,020
um if

180
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,220
you have an issue or witness any

181
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,960
Behavior not consistent with our code of

182
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,819
conduct report it to any radioed staff

183
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,919
member we're in the very bright pink

184
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,919
shirts this year are any of the safety

185
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,039
officers in the orange shirts again if

186
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,380
you want a full copy of the code of

187
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,300
conduct there's some signs everywhere

188
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,919
and then also check the printed program

189
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,660
as well

190
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,900
video photo policies uh you know we're a

191
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,580
bit different of a conference um you

192
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,900
know most conferences nowadays don't

193
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,400
have any kind of policies like this but

194
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,380
one thing that we like to have is um is

195
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,120
that we respect people's privacy and so

196
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,340
uh before you take any photos or videos

197
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,199
uh we just ask that you get permission

198
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,360
of everybody in the frame

199
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,120
um we actively discourage crowd shots uh

200
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,580
you know and that uh and if you have

201
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,440
mistakenly taken a photo or video of

202
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,340
somebody

203
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,800
um and if they uh you know delete it and

204
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,659
if they if you're asked by somebody to

205
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,880
delete or blur a photo you did please

206
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,799
respect that now there's one exception

207
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,599

208
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,039

00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,880
um so every year I would like to do some

219
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,620
t-shirt Charities uh take this

220
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,480
opportunity to give back we've actually

221
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,519
sold out of almost all of our t-shirts

222
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,620
via pre-sales which is amazing that like

223
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,000
never happens

224
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,440
um so there are a few shirts remaining

225
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,080
so please go to code check uh to get

226
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,820
those it's really cool shirts this year

227
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,100
they're actually glow in the dark

228
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,920
um so really cool and and uh we have

229
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,820
three different charities we're

230
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,160
supporting this year we have uh noise

231
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,880
Bridge eff and tectonica and so the the

232
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,440
net sales proceeds are going to be

233
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,320
benefiting these Charities so when you

234
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,519
pick up your shirt if you're already pre

235
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,399
bought one or if you're buying one Anew

236
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,320
you had the opportunity to actually

237
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,360
decide which charity you'll be

238
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,860
supporting

239
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,899
so again thanks to all of our sponsors

240
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,580
there's no way that we could do it

241
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,899
without them so let's take a second and

242
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,040
just give a round of applause to all of

243
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,519
our sponsors

244
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,220
I want to especially call out our four

245
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,140
leading sponsors this year we have Adobe

246
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,260
appiro code red partners and Google

247
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,800
um again it's we while we're they uh

248
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,720
we're actually the third biggest b-sides

249
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,800
in the world

250
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,660
um but we are by far the most expensive

251
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,459
besides to put on just because it's San

252
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,380
Francisco and everything is crazy

253
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,000
expensive here

254
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,440
um and so we could not do it without the

255
