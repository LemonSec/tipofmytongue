being patient with us yesterday I know

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,020
we had a lot of things going on we've

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,680
had issues we've had food issues we've

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,260
had the escalator breaking down and

18
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,239
having to like call repair Tech that

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,879
can't get here until who knows when

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,860
um so it's uh there's been a lot going

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,840
on this weekend so I just want to say uh

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,239
we apologize and thank you for again for

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,039
being patient with us we've tried to

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,260
make some changes for today to hopefully

25
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,079
alleviate some of the issues some of the

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,000
major things that I wanted to call out

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
spring typically is that we have opened

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,860
up two Sprint stairwells up so there's

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,500
one just down the hallway that will take

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,560
you all the way up to the fourth floor

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,780
and then another one on the mezzanine

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,280
level that goes between the mezzanine

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,960
and the fourth floor as well the

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,580
elevators are still available for use

35
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,979
and the escalators you can use to go up

36
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,200
you just cannot go down the escalators

37
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,119
which are on the fourth floor so that's

38
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,560
what we have you can either take the the

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,360
elevator down or we have two different

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,000
stairwells that you can use today so

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,439
hopefully that will help with things

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,780
we've also opened up another line that

43
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,420
owns for food stuff as well to try to

44
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,100
speed that up that process as well so

45
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,799
again apologies and please grant us some

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,360
Grace today as there may be additional

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,680
delays we're working through some stuff

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,360
especially as we just change the new

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
layout and and change things so thank

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,159
you again just a reminder our thing this

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,979

52
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,220

54
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,939

this together uh and so but our goal is

60
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,739
to expand the the conversation we want

61
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:19,319
to make sure that um people have plenty

62
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,260
of opportunities to participate and

63
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,239
expand their knowledge

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,099

67
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,400
value to the conversation

we have a career Village in the past but

109
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,080
we have completely reimagined it and so

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,860
in the Embarcadero room there is a queer

111
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,480
Village there's a lot of cool stuff

112
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,180
going on on there today I believe we're

113
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,260
going to be announcing some stuff on

114
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,580
social if that hasn't already been

115
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,519
posted about where you can actually meet

116
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,080

118
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,279
bit of everything so I know that times

119
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,199
have been challenging for a lot of folks

120
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,600
right now in all of across Tech and so I

121

uh video and photo policies uh just a

251
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,660
reminder of this as well we're a bit

252
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,440
different than a lot of other

253
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,480
conferences in that we do have a video

254
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,120
in photo policy basically the policy is

255
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,519
that uh you need permission of everybody

256
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,200
in the frame that you take a video or

257
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,540
photo of and so and crowd shots are

258
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,399
generally discouraged there is one

259
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,839
exception though we have our

260
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,140
photographer Kelsey here she is an

261
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,339
official photographer on behalf of

262
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,140
b-sides and so she is permitted to do

263
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,120
that however if you if she's taken a

264
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,800
photo and you do not want to be in it

265
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,420
just let her know she's super friendly

266
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,040
and she will be happy to make sure that

267
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,540
you're not in it or blurred out or

268
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,720
something whatever to make you happy

269
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,140
um so again thank you for that

270
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,580
we always do our t-shirt Charities every

271
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,860

pre-purchased online

281
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,019
and last but certainly certainly not

282
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:11,160
least

283
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,779
um you know this event's not possible

284
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,820
without our sponsors

285
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,920
um it costs a lot of money to put this

286
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,040
event on this is San Francisco and

287
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,260
finding an event space like this that we

288
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,120
can actually use and technically this is

289
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,800
two different venues that we have to pay

290
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,600
it's a lot of money

291
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,980
um and so it's not possible without our

292
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,899
sponsors and so we really do appreciate

293
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,480
all the sponsors that have enabled us to

294
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,080
put this year's event on please make

295
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,620
