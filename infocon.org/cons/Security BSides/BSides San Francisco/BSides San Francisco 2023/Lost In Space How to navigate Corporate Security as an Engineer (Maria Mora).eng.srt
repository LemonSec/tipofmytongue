00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,899
welcome to B-side second day I know it's

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,680
like pretty late in the day now but yeah

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,080
good to see all of you

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,820
so

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,799
I am not supposed to be on that slide

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,900
yet

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,160
okay

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,480
so

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,640
um we're gonna be talking about how to

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,039
navigate corporate security as an

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,140
engineer

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,580
and you know I I think at first it will

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,399
seem like I'm talking about soft skills

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,100
non-technical skills but we'll get there

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,860
so stay tuned

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,340
first off obligatory disclaimer

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,000
I am uh my My Views and content in this

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,440
presentation I'm just going to read it

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,480
from here are mine alone and does not

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,239

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,579
employer SiriusXM or my former employer

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,239
Crunchyroll

23
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:57,840
so

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,899
without further Ado here is the agenda

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,399
first off we're going to be talking

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,159
about corporate security what is it all

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,500
about and then we're going to be talking

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,600
about stakeholders

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,260
and then keeping track of all the things

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,320
and understanding the business

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,840
what happens when Personnel changes and

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,360
then we'll wrap it up

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,000
so yeah hi everyone I'm Maria are you

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,500
say them pronouns

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,100
I used to work at Crunchyroll and uh as

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,860
a software engineer and then I was a

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,020
senior secure application engineer until

38
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,000
I became staff security and compliance

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,180
engineer on the security team and now at

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,579
Sirius XM I am a staff application

41
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,560
security engineer working on the

42
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,740
application security team

43
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,680
so let's talk about corporate security

44
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,000
today

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,979
so when it comes to corporate security

46
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,280
you look at the business as a whole

47
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,320
are your team's objectives aligned with

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,460
the business

49
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,340
then consider your scope of securing all

50
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,259
of the things

51
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,180
do you secure the crown jewels of the

52
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,500
company

53
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,380
do you secure the employees do you

54
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,360
secure corporate assets

55
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,879
so basically your job is to help the

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,220
business continue to function through

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,260
cyber security related risk management

58
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,400
so when it comes to corporate security

59
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,260
you will be working with a lot of people

60
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,480
like a lot of people

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,579
this is not a job for Hermits

62
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,020
so the first thing you got to do is

63
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,560
figure out who your stakeholders are

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,840
so sorry

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,019
um when I started out at SiriusXM

66
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:46,680
um

67
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,720
one of the first things that I did was

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,000
identify my stakeholders

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,660
so you know it could be everyone it

70
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,900
could be a prioritized view especially

71
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,300
when you're drinking from the fire hose

72
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,000
so in any case start figuring out who

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
the people

74
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,940
are that you will be working with so

75
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,300
let's say do you work with a particular

76
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,239
team does your team have goals and

77
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,120
priorities then make sure to prioritize

78
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,220
your stakeholders accordingly

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,420
next

80
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,720
make a nice powerful impression on the

81
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,519
people that you work with

82
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,060
make your words count

83
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,060
so first off branding

84
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,519
this is about knowing yourself knowing

85
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,040
what you want people to see you as and

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,379
defining your narrative

87
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,540
and you know branding isn't just a

88
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,019
marketing thing it really is about

89
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,959
getting people to know you in a way that

90
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,420
you want them to know you as so if you

91
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,019
want to come off as Dependable then act

92
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,760
like it you know

93
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,519
if you want to come off as someone who's

94
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,060
good at a particular part of security

95
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,560
then you need to show them how good you

96
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,439
are at it or at least you know allude to

97
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,959
it and then they'll see your work

98
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,560
so putting out that strong impression on

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,440
people can definitely help you and

100
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,320
winning allies and friends and with your

101
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,060
stakeholders

102
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,419
next messaging

103
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,479
so just like Inigo Montoya and I know

104
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,100
I'm I'm probably taking this from

105
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,500
another talk be clear when communicating

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,000
with others

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,660
so when you introduce yourself to these

108
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,000
stakeholders

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,280
you also want to provide context with

110
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,960
anything that you're talking to them

111
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,860
about

112
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,800
so here's an example

113
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,160
um I I started out you know like just

114
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,520
talking to people introducing myself but

115
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,460
I I told them that hey I work in the

116
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,380
application security team

117
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,479
and I'm going to be working on so and so

118
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:04,680
project

119
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,540
can you help me with this can you help

120
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,580
me understand and that's where the

121
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,139
specify request part comes in

122
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,520
and then next

123
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,560
with the stakeholders you've identified

124
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,919
so far and spoken to so far does it make

125
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,900
sense to dig deeper and work with those

126
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,180
that they work with

127
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,280
so think about it this way

128
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,400
you have an org chart you figure out who

129
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,500
your initial stakeholders are

130
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,620
and then you talk to your stakeholders

131
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,180
and then sometimes they will redirect

132
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,699
you to other people sometimes they will

133
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,560
introduce you to other people that

134
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,600
they're working with and that's okay

135
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
that's exactly what we want

136
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,280
and then lastly

137
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,039
make friends

138
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,500
join you know like the different social

139
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,080
um Gatherings that you have at work

140
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,720
it's really good to

141
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,639
get to know everyone that you're working

142
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,100
with or if you don't even work directly

143
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,479
with each other

144
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,919
it's still nice to make friends

145
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,120
so you have all of those stakeholders

146
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,220
now what

147
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,860
well there's this thing

148
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,740
um that I I took a lesson from uh with

149
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,840
regards to like sales folks and all of

150
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,400
that there's this thing called customer

151
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,580
relationship management which is a great

152
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,520
tool it's a great way to keep track of

153
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,139
all your relationships with different

154
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:35,400
teams and stakeholders and whatnot

155
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,699
so in a similar fashion your

156
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,380
stakeholders can basically be your

157
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,840
customers or maybe even just folks that

158
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,180
you work with on a regular basis

159
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,220
once I figured out who I should start

160
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,660
talking to

161
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,460
and I've spoken to them a little bit

162
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,880
next step is to keep track of all these

163
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,300
relationships and work streams

164
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,360
so the great part about crms is that

165
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,100
it's an address book and communication

166
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,520
notification tool rolled into one

167
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,280
so a little bit of a disclaimer I did

168
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,039
not fully come up with this idea I

169
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,199
actually just played around with notion

170
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
a little bit and I found out that they

171
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,000
had this thing called like a friend

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,660
serum or like a personal CRM tool and

173
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,139
what it had was that you can like keep

174
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,139
track of your contacts you can keep

175
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,240
track of the latest updates

176
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,880
the last time you spoke to them and then

177
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,419
they basically had a formula on a

178
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,300
spreadsheet that you know if you haven't

179
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,599
spoken to them in like

180
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,819
one and a half months or three months or

181
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,440
what have you

182
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,639
you can basically get a notification or

183
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,840
you can see on the column here on the

184
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,599
on the left side it tells you if you

185
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,300
need to talk to them again or what

186
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,160
but basically this is a way to keep

187
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,380
track of all of the things that you need

188
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,900
to work with other stakeholders on keep

189
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,240
track of your work streams and make sure

190
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,979
you don't drop the ball

191
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,440
I know it's pretty easy to drop the ball

192
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,240
when you're working on so many things in

193
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,120
the security team so it's really

194
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,800
important for you to organize yourself

195
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,520
accordingly

196
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,699
so also consider keeping track of your

197
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,220
work streams in a better fashion chances

198
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,419
are

199
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:33,059
your team will be using some sort of

200
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,860
issue tracking tool

201
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,120
so whether or not you know the

202
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,339
particular issue tracking tool works for

203
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,299
you

204
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,000
make sure to keep track of all of the

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,500
things that

206
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,600
you're working with

207
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,660
and always document your work as part of

208
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,640
making a business case for more

209
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,920
resources for example

210
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,360
so issue tracking is really important

211
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,300
when you want to gain more resources or

212
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,580
you know like get head count

213
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,279
get more budget that sort of thing

214
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,060
and then after figuring out how to track

215
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,820
work you then figure out what you're up

216
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,899
against

217
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,120
this is why the above lists are so

218
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,220
important

219
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,500
so for example let's take a look at the

220
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,360
data inventory

221
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,120
we basically have to figure out where

222
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,620
all of the personally identifiable

223
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,300
information is whether or not it's

224
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,180
customer data you know it depends on the

225
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,920
kind of the kind of security team that

226
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,839
you have but you could possibly have um

227
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,300
pii for your customers or for your

228
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,000
employees so having that data inventory

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,640
can be pretty important in terms of

230
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,120
making sure that you stay

231
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,740
um

232
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,820
comply to regulatory things I guess and

233
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,360
then asset inventory for example I think

234
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,740
this one's a given

235
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,040
so knowing where and what your corporate

236
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,019
assets are instead of trying to figure

237
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,459
it out like just as an incident goes

238
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,660
is so useful so you know for example

239
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,519
having a risk assessment for these

240
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,260
assets to see how much we spend on

241
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,380
protecting these it's really important

242
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,940
stuff

243
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,120
and then another example and this is not

244
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,000
an exhaustive list at all is a software

245
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,880
inventory so knowing what software you

246
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,160
own what software you might be owning in

247
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,040
terms of Shadow I.T you know there might

248
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,500
be a lot of different employees out

249
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,060
there that use

250
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,160
something that hasn't been properly

251
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,800
acquired so

252
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,079
you want to keep track of all that stuff

253
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,260
as best as you can

254
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,800
so once you know what you have

255
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,620
the next step is to understand the

256
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,800
business

257
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,600
when it comes to understanding the

258
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,100
business

259
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,620
you will want to do your research work

260
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,480
again with your stakeholders you see a

261
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,800
theme Here

262
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,160
so identifying duplicate work for

263
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,180
example

264
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,940
you want to make sure that when you're

265
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,700
working with your stakeholders you're

266
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,860
basically optimizing the way that you

267
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,200
work with each other and making sure you

268
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,660
don't do duplicate work you set your

269
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,540
priorities accordingly and make sure

270
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,399
that you're either working at the same

271
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,160
time or working in a scheduled fashion

272
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,560
that works for all of you

273
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,440
and then also identify opportunities for

274
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,240
collaboration

275
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,300
so for example at my former job I

276
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,380
actually was talking to someone who knew

277
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,620
everybody and knew all the work streams

278
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,680
and we were like this is really useful

279
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,380
information we should work with you more

280
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,800
and she was like yeah let's do it

281
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,160
and it was so useful and fun to get to

282
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,800
know these different things

283
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,959
so contrast or compare that with

284
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,820
a team that is kind of siled imagine the

285
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,579
difference between a team that works

286
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,600
with other stakeholders and those uh

287
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,160
basically

288
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,380
kind of do their research on their own

289
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,320
not necessarily talking to other teams

290
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,700
it's like night and day

291
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:43,980
so

292
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,680
how do you do your research aside from

293
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,500
talking to other people you can document

294
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,260
all the things or document those that

295
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,540
you prioritize the most

296
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,579
leave documentation better than you

297
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,800
found it and likewise write

298
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,519
documentation when you can't find it

299
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,980
sometimes tribal knowledge exists in

300
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,899
people's heads people that have been

301
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,579
around for a long time

302
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,800
that could be you that could be an

303
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,440
engineer that could be hopefully someone

304
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,839
who's still in the company

305
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,060
remember that knowledge leaves with the

306
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,519
people involved with it that's tribal

307
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,959
knowledge and someone must write

308
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,660
documentation so we can keep a record of

309
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,980
what's going on

310
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,700
for example run books Play Books

311
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,800
all of the different documentation about

312
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,339
where this thing is or that thing or

313
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,920
what the office is

314
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,740
um like in terms of networking

315
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,540
so definitely

316
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,380
it will require some writing skills but

317
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,660
you can learn about it

318
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,660
so how do you document things

319
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,600
information architecture is the keyword

320
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,800
here

321
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,300
so

322
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,899
we should be considering our audience

323
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,240
what are the most relevant pieces of

324
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,459
information for them

325
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,620
how do you direct your audience from

326
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,540
more General to more specific

327
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,519
documentation

328
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,220
and how do you manage navigation of all

329
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,839
these different topics

330
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,880
all of those are concepts of information

331
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,279
architecture

332
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,440
so look it up on your own time

333
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,680
definitely something to look into

334
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,959
I will guarantee you that your

335
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,839
documentation will look so good once you

336
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,220
understand the concept

337
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,880
now you have your documentation

338
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,800
and you have your stakeholders you

339
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,480
understand the business

340
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,920
you're going to communicate with

341
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,920
everyone so communication is so

342
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,360
important for teasing out tribal

343
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,940
knowledge for documentation it is

344
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,339
important for working well with others

345
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,100
and do not take it for granted

346
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,240
definitely not

347
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,480
so you might have seen these different

348
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,779
um what would you call these uh

349
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:11,040
anecdotes you know things that people

350
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,260
say they're like this meeting could have

351
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,779
been an email you see it in mugs all the

352
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,420
time or this email could have been a

353
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,100
slack message

354
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,860
well the thing is the the art of

355
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,540
communicating effectively with different

356
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,880
people is based on the age-old saying

357
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,639
that it depends really depends on the

358
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:32,760
situation it depends on the culture

359
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,220
of your company do people like to set

360
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,800
meetings then you know you might have to

361
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,660
go with the flow go with the preference

362
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,639
of your stakeholders

363
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,860
our employees expected to be diligent

364
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,839
for their email

365
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,880
does everything really get talked about

366
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,040
on Slack

367
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,899
it really depends on the situation

368
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,579
basically

369
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,160
and then another thing about messaging

370
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,720
is that

371
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,120
I do have a few other tips

372
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,920
so for example

373
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,720
right now I'm working with a lot of

374
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,300
people on the East Coast so considering

375
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,940
time zones is imperative

376
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,860
especially if you're working with global

377
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,139
teams you might not know it but you

378
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,079
might be working with people from Asia

379
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:19,019
Europe for example and you'll really

380
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,300
have to consider a proper Cadence for

381
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,260
how you're going to be working with them

382
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,180
asynchronous communication is probably a

383
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,699
must at this point but then meetings

384
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,639
who's going to adjust so these are just

385
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,440
some things to consider

386
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,279
next set expectations goals and

387
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,560
deliverables and meeting descriptions or

388
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,120
if you don't know the deliverables you

389
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,980
can talk about it and put it in your

390
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,300
meeting notes

391
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,880
this is super important especially when

392
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,940
people get a lot of meeting invites and

393
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,620
they're double booked

394
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,959
or even if they're not that busy you

395
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,339
don't want people going to your meeting

396
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,199
and be like

397
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:01,380
why am I in this meeting what is this or

398
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,880
they might not even come to the meeting

399
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,559
because they have no idea what's going

400
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,380
on so it's really important to set those

401
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,140
expectations goals and deliverables

402
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,760
and then lastly appsec CRM sorry that's

403
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,980
actually the the thing that I call this

404
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,599
ERM that we use

405
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,040
at

406
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,699
um

407
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,260
at my company

408
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,400
so the CRM is basically

409
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,640
going to be extremely useful for this

410
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,980
for scheduling follow-ups on a regular

411
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,360
Cadence

412
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,940
now you can probably you know figure

413
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,880
this out with your stakeholders but it's

414
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,100
important to keep track using the CRM as

415
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,900
well

416
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,600
so that said

417
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,240
you know you you can probably figure a

418
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,299
lot of this out as you go along but I

419
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:52,919
think it's important to talk about it as

420
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,160
well

421
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,780
so yeah with regards to all of that

422
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,000
stuff you can make allies of your

423
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,039
stakeholders

424
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,900
just work with them all communicate

425
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:09,080
effectively document all of the things

426
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,340
and yeah

427
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,880
so what happens when the Personnel

428
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,580
changes what happens during mergers and

429
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,200
acquisitions

430
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,539
team structures change

431
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:25,260
or what happens when reorgs happen

432
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,919
what happens when people come and go and

433
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,860
you're working with a new set of people

434
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,000
so what do you do now

435
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,679
so the thing is like I said earlier

436
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,200
knowledge walks out with the people so

437
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,240
it is important to craft repeatable

438
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,460
processes and workflows for working with

439
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,360
new stakeholders

440
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,260
so here's a little bit of an idea on how

441
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,620
you could present it or think about it

442
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,140
so I just wrote this last night to be

443
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,200
honest and I was thinking about how you

444
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,320
can probably set a function an algorithm

445
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,200
a method for how you're working with

446
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,940
these different people

447
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,120
of course there are going to be certain

448
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,400
nuances that you'll want to consider

449
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,840
but

450
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,120
at the end of the day there are

451
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,520
processes you can templatize

452
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,100
so that you're not Reinventing the wheel

453
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,720
over and over again when we're working

454
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,860
with so many new people

455
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,500
and then at the end of the day

456
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,620
you want to celebrate your wins take a

457
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,020
breather and remind others like your

458
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,020
stakeholders to do the same

459
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,960
because it's hard work

460
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,480
they may call this you know like soft

461
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,000
skills non-technical skills

462
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,299
but it really is hard work to

463
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:52,620
maintain all of those different

464
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,380
connections so it's really important for

465
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,460
us

466
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,179
to all just take it all in and find time

467
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,539
for yourself

468
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,039
so today we discuss what corporate

469
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,419
security is

470
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:09,299
stakeholders and how to Captivate them

471
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,120
how to best understand the business

472
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,400
and what to do when the personal changes

473
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,640
like think lather wrench repeat

474
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,940
and celebrate your wins with your team

475
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,340
so the slides will be up online soon but

476
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,320
feel free to take a photo of the slide

477
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,880
to take home

478
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,440
and yeah

479
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,299
I don't know if we have enough time but

480
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:33,240
I am open for at least one question

481
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,640
thank you everyone and thank you for

482
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,000

thank you Maria we have time for one to

484
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,520
two questions

485
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,700
uh do we have any questions out here and

486
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,160
if not we can follow up in the lobby I

487
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,700
see one here

488
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,959
[Music]

489
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,400
thank you very much mate

490
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,460
um I have a question what is your uh

491
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,559
kind of approach to networking and uh

492
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,120
kind of building relationships in this

493
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,059
field outside of your workplace uh in

494
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,480
the more more broad security community

495
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,559
okay so I mostly talked about

496
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,600
networking within your company but you

497
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,160
wanted to talk about outside the company

498
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,240
right

499
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,480
well for all of those in the room you're

500
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,940
already taking the first step

501
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,720
be at conferences volunteer

502
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,059
and you know just keep coming and and

503
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,520
then there will be people who you notice

504
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,100
are there all the time

505
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,220
so definitely that is one good way to

506
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,600
get to know people join forums read 2600

507
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,039
magazine

508
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,200
for example and then you know get to

509
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,940
