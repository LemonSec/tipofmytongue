and Jeffrey they'll be our speakers

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,760
thank you welcome everyone today we're

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,380
going to be talking about life of a bug

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,199
and insight on github's bug Bounty

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,119
program

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,460
a brief agenda what we're going to talk

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,679
about today so we will both introduce

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,320
ourselves then Jeff is going to give a

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,239
high level overview of our Bounty

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,520
program then I will jump into a high

15
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,520
level overview of our P cert program we

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,460
will then introduce a mock bug which we

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,280
will uh walk you through the process of

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,980
our two teams collaborating on the bug

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,460
from triage through the whole IR process

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,039
Jeff will go over some tips and

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,539
takeaways and then we'll do any q a

22
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:02,879
so my name is Caitlin I am a product

23
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,119
security engineer with GitHub I lead our

24
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,280
piecer engineering team which is a

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,220
subset of P cert where we dive into more

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,619
data-driven metrics of our

27
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,560
investigations digging into variant

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,380
analysis Trend tracking really diving

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,119
into the pain points of what we're

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,060
seeing across pcert my background is in

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,040
corporate security moved into product

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,259
security and incident response when I

33
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,640
came on board with GitHub about two

34
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,119
years ago

35
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,600
hey everybody I'm Jeff several years in

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,939
phone management slash you know managing

37
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,100
triaging multiple bug Bounty programs

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,920
May senior project engineer at GitHub

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,200
tons of bug Bounty stuff that we do

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,780
there huge researcher engagement

41
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,360
Advocate will go down some of the what

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,979
that looks like soon

43
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,360
um and just passionate about all things

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,640
security

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,140
let's talk a little bit about a high

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,960
level of our program and what bug Bounty

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,360
looks like at GitHub we manage two

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,399
programs a public program that has a

49
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,740
very extensive scope which researchers

50
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,679
love and we love that they love that a

51
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,200
private program 25 hackedo cats this is

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,520
something we've been operating for like

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,580
two years three three years and slowly

54
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,440
we've been revamping it and offering

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,020
more beta features and cool engagements

56
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,520
for our researchers who really know our

57
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,900
products well

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,700
and we have a dedicated GitHub staff

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,140
this is something that's kind of unique

60
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,980
we have a team that solely uh focuses on

61
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,540
our program

62
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,360
um yeah I'm part of that team researcher

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,099
committee engagement one of the my

64
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,860
favorite parts of working at GitHub

65
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,500
um we recently launched a public Bounty

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,900
swag store might not seem like a law but

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,120
we got a lot of feedback at Defcon we

68
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,440
met up with some hackers and we're like

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,140
hey we'd love to kind of rep your your

70
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,060
your stuff you know your your swag but

71
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,200
more specifically Bounty specific swag

72
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,400
you know and so we launched a store

73
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,500
that's just for our researchers very

74
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,440
funky very cool and we love it we do a

75
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,239
lot of blog posts where we highlight our

76
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,800
researchers and we just kind of give

77
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,300
them a microphone and let people know

78
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,159
why they're hacking on our programs some

79
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,319
of their favorite bugs that they found

80
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,519
Etc

81
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,379
um yeah we offer exclusive perks cool

82
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,120
beta access which everybody likes right

83
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,159
hunting on a new feature is always fun

84
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,239
and large rewards we award up to 50K

85
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,340
which is you know a good amount in the

86
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,540
industry right now

87
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,400
uh we've been operating for about nine

88
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,340
years we've awarded about 3.9 million so

89
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,019
far

90
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,099
in Bounty rewards and uh we've hit 1.5

91
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,920
million in 2020 2022 which is great

92
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,379
right uh we have top researchers testing

93
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,120
that keep coming back and I think that's

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,760
that's a testament of our program uh

95
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,500
tons of stuff around Community

96
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,540
engagement like I said earlier and uh

97
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,700
that's why we focus heavily on it and

98
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,379
it's this program the way we have it

99
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,239
structured really strengthens our

100
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,159
customer engineering and IR partnership

101
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,560
and its own unique ways and we'll

102
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,540
highlight how that what that looks like

103
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,500
throughout the presentation

104
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,819
um here's her here's our scope breakdown

105
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,980
just a quick high level almost

106
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,959
everything is in scope almost everything

107
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,060
is eligible for rewards

108
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,220
um Dependable code space is the types of

109
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,918
products that everybody uses on daily

110
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,260
um you can check out our scope and our

111
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,080
own personal site on

112
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,300
ballion.gettable.com scope or our policy

113
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,400
page on hacker1 what's not eligible is

114
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,259
basically just open source projects we

115
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:33,540
welcome contributions there but most of

116
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,240
them are out of scope and known

117
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,919
vulnerable software we don't really pay

118
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,560
for those uh Upstream dependencies we

119
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,660
sometimes help coordinate that but it's

120
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,160
not something we can usually award for

121
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,740
and a few more things and you can check

122
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,180
that out in our ineligible site

123
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,080
so pisert from a high level we are

124
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,240
responsible for the product security

125
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,880
vulnerabilities that impact GitHub

126
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,160
products and our customers you may be

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,860
familiar with more cert uh our team is

128
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,479
called Thor on the other side they are

129
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,919
the corporate security side but of

130
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,120
course we're doing product security

131
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,000
within psert so we handle any security

132
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,180
reports in three different ways first we

133
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,699
will start with a lead so when a

134
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,340
security report comes in uh we will

135
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,520
always spin up a lead with NP cert and

136
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,900
this is very important part of the

137
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,400
process where we can start generating

138
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,380
those metrics that we will utilize

139
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,139
throughout this whole process

140
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,000
and then once we have that lead

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,100
validated we will turn it into an

142
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,479
investigation if a investigation we deem

143
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,860
is more severe or involves data that may

144
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,600
need a specific notification

145
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,039
requirements we'll turn that into an

146
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,380
incident so you may be wondering where

147
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,300
are these security reports coming from

148
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,940
well thank thankfully we do have a very

149
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,620
secure minded uh internal group of

150
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,780
hubbers who will often report security

151
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,639
findings directly to us and assert

152
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,300
assert slack channel that everyone is uh

153
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,460
I can access and is open to

154
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,800
but we also get a very large number

155
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,680
number of external reports right so a

156
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,759
lot of them come through our Bounty

157
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,280
program but we also do monitor blogs

158
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,919
Twitter uh security companies will write

159
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,380
into us we do get third-party reports

160
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,240
occasionally and of course our customers

161
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,060
and users as well

162
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,699
So within P sir it's we do receive a

163
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,520
large number of reports and one of the

164
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,919
most important things about a program

165
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,199
that is very process driven and receives

166
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,199
so much coming in at once is automation

167
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,919
so we are very very big on automation uh

168
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,500
within pcert at GitHub and one of the

169
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,780
things we utilize quite a bit are our

170
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,940
chat Ops everything is integrated with

171
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,060
the GitHub platform and slack so that we

172
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,039
are essentially just triggering a bunch

173
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,500
of chat Ops and dog fooding our product

174
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,100
which is something we do a lot and uh

175
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,039
it's really good about taking out a lot

176
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,319
of the third party products and not

177
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:10,259
needing them and just utilizing our own

178
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,600
tools so we do this with leads I'm going

179
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,880
to walk you through how we do that once

180
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,060
we do introduce the bug and then how we

181
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,319
go through that whole process with

182
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,720
investigations another thing we do with

183
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,580
automation is something called slash

184
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,319
commands this is something built into

185
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,120
GitHub and we use this for

186
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,759
prioritization because we get so many

187
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,919
reports in we need to know what to work

188
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,979
on first so we use these slash commands

189
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,259
and I'll show you this as well to

190
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,479
determine this prioritization we will

191
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,419
slap a label on him for ACT attend track

192
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,479
and based on those labels will determine

193
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,039
what gets acted on first

194
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,520
cool so let's reveal bug from the

195
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,259
beginning to the end of it uh it'll give

196
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,599
an Insight on the Bounty side of things

197
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,979
on the piece or side of things and how

198
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,620
they are intertwined

199
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,220
um

200
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,979
so in this case we use hacker one to you

201
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,740
know to receive these bugs in this case

202
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,160
we got an idor on Mona Hub

203
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,860
um and yeah it's a fake bug if the red

204
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,720
didn't indicate it it's definitely very

205
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,979
fake

206
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,740
um that I created and so this is what

207
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,960
happens when the bug comes in in this

208
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,240
case uh that's that's me right so I

209
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,580
triage the the bug I reproduce it I'm

210
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,740
like oh this is valid so we have

211
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,539
automation ourselves to make this faster

212
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:31,500
right

213
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,020
um and in this case the report ID is

214
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,640
that number there and we'll run a

215
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,099
command that says hey go this is valid

216
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:40,020
let's go ahead and triage this to the

217
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,820
engineering team that owns this we'll

218
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,360
throw it over to the repo and this bot

219
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,519
will safely throw everything over to the

220
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,760
repo and that's when the person who's

221
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,459
triaging the the report will say hey

222
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,680
here's my reproduction steps on it

223
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,440
here's where I think this is happening

224
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,899
um I was able to maybe escalate this

225
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,060
um and in this case you know I

226
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,880
charge it over I added my summary which

227
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,040
I didn't show but it's down below and

228
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,820
then I realized that it does impact uh

229
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,980
GitHub Enterprise server which is ghes

230
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,060
you'll see that throughout the

231
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,060
presentation and uh it's about a medium

232
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,920
plus so in that case we're gonna have to

233
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,779
Loop in piecer

234
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:22,620
um

235
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,320
we'll talk about that so at this point

236
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,660
bug Bounty is going to Loop into Loop

237
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,060
and piece art and we will get our

238
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,740
on-call person or whoever is available

239
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,920
to get started on this lead so we

240
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,019
utilize this chat up that we have built

241
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,740
in-house uh within slack and it will uh

242
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,200
ask us to answer a few questions you can

243
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,300
see in the screenshot we'll assign a

244
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,200
psert IC added title add the summary

245
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,880
assign it to the team because our

246
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,240
counterpart Thor cert does this uses the

247
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,000
slack chat up as well and then of course

248
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,040
we're plugging in the type this is

249
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,540
coming from Bounty so that we're getting

250
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,640
these metrics going within the lead

251
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,459
immediately as you can see in this

252
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,339
screenshot as well it does put the lead

253
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,860
directly in a GitHub repo and this is

254
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,240
where once again we're utilizing the

255
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,300
GitHub product to start tracking a paper

256
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,700
trail of our incidents so we always have

257
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,100
a reference back to these

258
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,580
so once we have this lead spun up and an

259
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,440
issue created we're going to go back to

260
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,300
the initial reporter and we're going to

261
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,860
acknowledge the fact that we got this

262
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,019
lead and we've started the

263
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,440
um process of tracking it and the next

264
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,019
step uh will be to determine that

265
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,540
prioritization and of course impact so

266
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,700
once again we're going to go back to the

267
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,860
Automation and use the slash commands

268
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,060
it's going to ask us a series of

269
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,620
questions and it's going to spit out an

270
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,019
action and based on that action you can

271
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,360
see here it tells us to act but not only

272
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,880
do we want to rely on this automation we

273
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,459
also have to really think about what

274
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,320
this bug is and think about the impact

275
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,820
because the impact to the GitHub

276
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,640
customers and users and our product is

277
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,200
really the most important thing so we

278
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,560
know off uh what this bug is in idor

279
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,440
that the impact is an attacker could

280
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,560
manipulate user data not good so we know

281
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,060
at this stage that we need to convert

282
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,740
the lead so once again we're going to go

283
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,360
back to our chat ups and it's going to

284
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,760
ask us a series of very very well known

285
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,260
incident response questions like

286
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,540
severity sensitivity so we're going to

287
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,880
assign a TLP and then it's going to ask

288
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,100
us some more slack related questions do

289
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,959
we want to make private slack channels

290
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,820
that's going to be based mostly on that

291
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,279
TLP so this stage we're converting this

292
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,040
lead directly into an investigation our

293
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,200
chat op is going to do this on the

294
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,480
GitHub issue side as well so it's fully

295
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,339
documented in the issue we don't have to

296
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,800
go back into it do anything manually at

297
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,860
this point it's fully converted and one

298
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,200
of the things as Jeff mentioned is that

299
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,959
we know that because this impacts gags

300
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,180
gonna probably GitHub Enterprise server

301
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,940
we will need to issue a CBE so that's

302
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,320
another reason why we're going to

303
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,540
convert this into an investigation make

304
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,339
sure that's fully documented make sure

305
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,100
the pcert IC is responsible for

306
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,200
assigning that cve getting all these

307
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,820
details in there and getting it in the

308
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,760
release notes for ghs so that customers

309
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,920
know the security impact of a patch

310
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,440
so at this stage we are beginning the

311
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,839
investigation so we have the severity

312
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,019
set TLP of course our slack channels and

313
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,700
our summary is getting developed

314
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,220
everything is uh automated to this point

315
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,740
and now the psert IC is going to come in

316
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,720
develop that summary although I have a

317
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,700
feeling we could start using copilot for

318
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,380
this a little bit uh to generate

319
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,139
generate that summary and we will take

320
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:44,700
that summary put it in the slack Channel

321
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,740
make sure it's pinned we'll have next

322
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,959
steps assign Engineers to those next

323
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,339
steps so that anybody who comes into

324
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,959
that slab Channel knows exactly what's

325
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,300
going on what's going to happen next and

326
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,700
we don't have to answer questions about

327
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,579
any of that

328
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,560
so simultaneously while this

329
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,480
investigation is getting spun up we're

330
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,959
also working in the response phase so

331
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,060
this stage we are dealing with the most

332
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,339
important priority and that is to stop

333
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,200
the bleeding so the good thing about

334
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,839
working with our bug Bounty Partners is

335
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,120
that they will often engage engineering

336
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,639
before it ever even comes to pisert they

337
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,100
will get the engineers engaged on this

338
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,399
bug a mitigation will often get being

339
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,560
worked on very very quickly sometimes

340
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,540
before it even comes to pisert which is

341
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,240
awesome for us we love to see that if

342
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,160
not we will definitely jump on it and

343
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,380
get engaged with engineering team who

344
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,720
owns the issue uh we'll ask them for a

345
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,820
root cause they'll develop that

346
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,399
mitigation and then they will also

347
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,800
develop those backboards for gags since

348
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,560
we know that DHS is impacted while

349
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,360
that's happening on the engineering side

350
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,420
the pcert IC will also be determining

351
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,579
scope of impact so they'll do that by

352
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,680
reviewing logs looking for evidence of

353
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,200
exploitation all this is going into the

354
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,660
slack Channel or issue for full

355
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,240
documentation for review and determining

356
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,860
our next phase and that is a

357
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,380
notification so with every incident we

358
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,480
always ask this question uh our

359
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,880
notifications needed we try to be as

360
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,720
transparent as possible with GitHub so

361
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,519
notifications are a big part of the job

362
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,100
we do for this bug we know specifically

363
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,579
that a cve is necessary so psert IC is

364
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,860
going to issue that CV work with the

365
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,660
ghes team to get that in the release

366
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,820
notes for the next patch make sure that

367
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,800
all parties are aware of this specific

368
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,200
bug that's not the only notification

369
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,839
that you may have seen from GitHub so we

370
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,720
also have github.blog which is our blog

371
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,880
post we use a security tag for any

372
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,320
security news that we have that goes out

373
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,380
we've had a a good number of blog posts

374
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,300
trying to be as transparent as possible

375
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,860
about the bugs that we found on our

376
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,380
platform and then we also utilize our

377
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,660
change log for bugs that may be smaller

378
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,880
but we want users to know that a change

379
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,060
has been implemented in.com especially

380
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,220
if it may impact them and then of course

381
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,320
we also have direct emails

382
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,839
if we're able to scope for impact and

383
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,360
have a list of users then we will send

384
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,519
out direct emails

385
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,500
this stage bug Bounty is going to work

386
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,839
with the researcher

387
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,339
all right so at this point we're

388
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,959
backboarding stuff right and and we're

389
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,820
getting ready to wrap stuff up from the

390
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,800
piece search side so Bounty is also

391
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,899
starting to wrap things up by

392
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,940
asking a researcher hey this qualifies

393
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,339
for credit uh cve credit which is

394
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:38,399
awesome right and our site states that

395
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,240
um

396
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,820
most most bugs with GTS there's like a

397
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,339
specific language but ghes will usually

398
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,199
get cves right for a specific severity

399
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:49,019
maybe and so in this case we asked

400
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,600
researcher hey not shown but in the

401
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,160
background we're doing

402
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,260
constant communication Ryan so we'll

403
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,399
tell them how would you like to be

404
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,839
credited for this if you would like

405
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,600
credit at all and at the same time we're

406
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,579
also doing in the background right we're

407
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,680
getting together and we're deciding what

408
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,720
the payout should be which is a very

409
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,060
transparent consistent process the

410
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,380
Bounty person who had it from the

411
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,199
beginning will pitch and suggest a

412
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,839
payout based on our external um and

413
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,579
public

414
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:19,800
uh severity

415
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,600
um payout guidelines and in this case

416
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,240
you know we suggested 10K and that's

417
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,100
because the this is you know what it

418
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,240
falls under

419
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,160
um based on our external site and this

420
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,600
is what we've paid out in the past for

421
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,399
this type of idor

422
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,720
um and then we also you know talk about

423
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,420
the impact and all that so uh every week

424
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,279
we have a payout call where the whole

425
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,779
team will get together and review these

426
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,660
and all of us have to agree on it and if

427
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,040
we don't then we go back to the drawing

428
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,839
board and we decide you know what's

429
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,940
what's the fair amount if we missed the

430
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,040
mark on the first round uh which is cool

431
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,399
from my side like when we go and pay out

432
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,560
the reporter uh you know a researcher

433
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,720
they'll feel like it's fair and you know

434
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,940
we usually don't get a lot of um like

435
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,259
back and forth on that and it's because

436
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,420
it lines up directly with her with our

437
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,679
site

438
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:05,280
um

439
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,900
and yeah for more information on our

440
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,419
rewards our Bounty side is extremely up

441
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,720
to date

442
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,980
so now we're working into the post

443
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,640
investigation side of the house here uh

444
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,939
and that is going to be the pcert IC is

445
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,619
going to take all this information

446
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,359
everything we've done throughout the

447
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,160
investigation and put that in a

448
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,620
blameless post-mortem a GitHub we're

449
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,679
very big on promoting a blameless

450
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,600
culture it's all a learning experience

451
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,940
for us and um it's very important that

452
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:36,840
we

453
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,080
uh maintain that so in our postmortem

454
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,120
we're going to include of course a

455
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,000
summary timeline RCA Lessons Learned

456
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,039
after actions uh because we don't want

457
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,660
to hold up the investigation with after

458
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,240
actions or any lessons learned that we

459
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,539
want to carry forward across the org so

460
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:55,799
we're going to

461
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,380
list those there put them in pirs post

462
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,900
incident repair items and then close out

463
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,120
that post-mortem this is something I

464
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,860
know I mentioned co-pilot earlier but

465
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,160
this is something that we do uh use Code

466
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,200
Pilot for sometimes it does help us and

467
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,940
any help we can get in getting these

468
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,440
reports out faster

469
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,799
it's much better so this is where my

470
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,260
team comes in piecer engineering we're

471
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,880
going to work through prevention

472
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,679
prevention is a big thing right we want

473
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,179
to reduce the number of incidents that

474
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,340
we're seeing come in so we do things

475
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,960
like bone review meetings where we

476
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,059
review our postmortems and we share our

477
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,400
findings with the greater org we do

478
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,080
varying analysis where we really dig

479
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,960
into uh bugs and we try to find variants

480
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
in different parts of the code base we

481
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,620
work with our code analysis team to

482
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,900
develop detections and Sentinel and code

483
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,419
ql queries and then of course all these

484
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,280
become posts incident repair items that

485
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,720
we're tracking elsewhere

486
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,880
cool so like I said earlier the you know

487
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,919
payout was suggested at this point we're

488
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,660
going to award the payout

489
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,980
um and you know this is one of the

490
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,039
languages that we use when we uh when we

491
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,740
pay out the reports so wrapping stuff up

492
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,299
um we're giving a coupon free of charge

493
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,700
get a pro for life

494
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,280
um and then in this case it because it

495
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,500
got a cve uh this is something we've

496
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,660
piloted maybe a little more than six

497
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,700
months ago where we started to try to

498
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,860
share with the hacker Community besides

499
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,320
you know what we're up to actual

500
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,820
summaries of like the reports that we're

501
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,539
getting

502
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,740
um and I know there's a lot of work to

503
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,480
be done there right full disclosure is

504
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,760
what everybody wants um and this is you

505
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,380
know one of the first steps there and so

506
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,760
in this case we tell them hey we tell

507
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,679
them hey there's a CD that's being

508
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,299
published we would like to disclose a

509
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:37,980
summary and you know some of the report

510
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,140
contents and so we're excited to share

511
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,520
with the hiker Community if you if

512
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,500
you're okay with that and this is kind

513
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,660
of like the process that you see when it

514
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,220
happens

515
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,840
so let's talk about some tips and

516
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,160
takeaways

517
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,780
by the way there's a lot more we could

518
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,640
cover you know but 25 minutes is 25

519
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,660
minutes

520
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,460
um so transparency and trust is

521
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,799
something that hopefully was obvious

522
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,080
throughout the the process for both

523
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,179
teams and you know engaging with the

524
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,679
researcher with the with the engineering

525
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,120
teams

526
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,440
um and researcher engagement is hard

527
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,840
right because we want people to to keep

528
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,000
coming back um and everybody has their

529
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,440
own story their own reasons for bug

530
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,860
hunting and so we try to have a very

531
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,539
consistent and transparent process when

532
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,400
we work with researchers and something

533
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,780
like that looks like is like having

534
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,120
consistent communication

535
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,860
um so we've partnered with like legal PR

536
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,660
to make sure that when we communicate

537
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,179
with folks it's consistent and the

538
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,460
language is usually uh the same you know

539
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,320
with all these and along with that

540
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,360
customers and users are just as

541
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,700
important and so they hear things from

542
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,340
us first just like uh Caitlyn kind of

543
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,799
went through some of our notifications

544
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,960
um and there's a lot of value in being

545
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,000
transparent like that and I we we've

546
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,580
seen uh a lot of good things come from

547
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,500
that another thing is maturing

548
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,960
automation is important that's very easy

549
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,940
to say right but it is something that we

550
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,460
put in practice as you saw bounty has

551
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,780
their own automation it makes things

552
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,539
very easy very quick Treehouse things

553
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,340
over you know all the report content

554
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,320
goes with it that's awesome

555
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,640
um it'd be very hard if it was all

556
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,980
manual right which happens in when when

557
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,559
you first launch a program I'm sure

558
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,240
um but yeah same thing with piecer and

559
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,160
so automating the easy stuff first is is

560
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,660
the way right and then you build off of

561
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,460
that based on the pain points that you

562
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,480
see in uh the you know the the time that

563
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
you have to to address those

564
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,140
um and then lastly Bounty and peace your

565
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,000
teams for us right are extremely closely

566
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,460
aligned we're under the same uh director

567
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,039
and so what that causes is a very quick

568
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,840
and seamless process for incident

569
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,640
response so when the bug comes in you

570
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,900
know we have these processes that make

571
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,299
sure that we can go from receiving it to

572
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:43,980
fixing it extremely quickly because the

573
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,480
teams are so close and we have built

574
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,460
these processes together

575
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,000
um and it works it works amazing for us

576
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,860
and that's kind of that's all we have

577
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,000
for today

578
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,580
um again 25 minutes is is all we had but

579
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,320
there's a lot that we'd like to share

580
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,720
more uh if you have any questions we

581
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,280
still have about four minutes for

582
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,659
questions

583
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,220
um and you can follow us on Twitter and

586
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,820
theater 15 round of applause the best

587
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,559
audience at b-sides

588
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,000
folk who have questions please raise

589
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,620
your hand slido is down so we're gonna

590
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,179
do a microphone if you guys want to

591
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,159
project save with your chest go for it

592
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,220
oh I'm supposed to say

593
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,440
good okay uh sorry you guys can pick

594
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,520
yeah

595
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,780
oh for pizza

596
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,480
um and working with the engineering team

597
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,220
you know sometimes they do last longer

598
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,260
we do have

599
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,260
yeah so yeah

600
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,000
but I'll say our engineering

601
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,260
but yeah

602
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,700
are we doing microphone or any other

603
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,940
questions

604
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,860
test test

605
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,179
so I really like that your scope is

606
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:28,980
pretty wide uh how was that decision

607
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,480
made is this like a top-down thing

608
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,760
saying we want to be super secure it's

609
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,000
bottoms up saying let's find out and how

610
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,980
did you get the buy-in I guess from the

611
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,380
product teams yeah yeah that's that's a

612
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,360
great question it varies right based on

613
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,480
uh uh you know like you said right uh

614
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,280
leadership and some leadership could get

615
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,080
nervous right with like hey this feature

616
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,179
we don't really want to advertise that's

617
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,400
in scope or whatever right like for us

618
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,380
it's uh because we have such a blameless

619
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,000
process it's uh everyone's excited to to

620
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,320
launch a product and then put it in

621
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,299
scope to get additional testing because

622
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:04,919
we have all these different testings in

623
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,419
place right we have a bunch of teams

624
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,400
that run their own scanning tools their

625
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,140
own testing and everything but we see

626
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,299
Bounty as like the seventh or the eighth

627
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,580
right it's not the one we rely on and

628
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,900
it's not the one we get the most bugs

629
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,299
with but it's the the nice to have you

630
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,280
know extra testing and the ones that

631
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,080
aren't in that public scope they're most

632
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,640
likely in our private scope you know

633
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,080
with with our private bug Bounty

634
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,580
researchers so we're getting eyes on

635
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,080
these all the time and we're seeing a

636
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,400
lot of value in that our customers are

637
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,960
loving the fact that we're okay with

638
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,360
testing our stuff and in great depth

639
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,940
yeah but it's hard to get by and if if

640
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,919
the culture doesn't follow that so you

641
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,419
have to set it you know and then nurture

642
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:40,260
it

643
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,400
easier said than the

644
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,159
any other questions

645
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,059
okay yeah

646
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,020
I understood the question

647
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
um

648
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,360
yeah that's a great question I think

649
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,460
that might be a little out of out of

650
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,080
scope for us to give you like a valid

651
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,299
answer on unfortunately

652
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,799
um but if you're curious and if you

653
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,360
write me on Twitter I'm happy to track

654
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,100
down the right person to outside that

655
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,779
might be closer to like assessment or

656
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,460
you know some of the the teams that work

657
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,080
closer with like when the products are

658
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,760
launching like that or where they're at

659
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,039
with launching those but yeah I can't I

660
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,200
can't really help you with that

661
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,480
