1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,700
welcome to detection as code the

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,620
engineering future of detection and

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,080
response I'm Jackie Beau

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,540
and I will be your panel moderator today

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,540
I'm really excited to get to talk to you

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,860
all I'm really excited to be back at

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,199
b-sides my favorite conference don't

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,440
tell the other ones don't tell them

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,180
all right so what are we going to talk

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,380
about today

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,420
we're going to talk about how applying

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,060
engineering focused Concepts and like a

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,640
software engineering mentality to kind

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,439
of the classic world that is pretty

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,360
Manual of detection and response

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,780
actually unlocks so many possibilities

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,480
reduces manual toil and just makes

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,460
everyone's lives better

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,579
so in particular what I'm talking about

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,579
in applying these kinds of Concepts is

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,820
and how it makes us better is it helps

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,860
us detect actual serious threats to our

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,140
environments rather than what tools or

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,180
things that we have no control over tell

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,920
us is a threat

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,960
it helps us automate a lot of the noise

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,820
out of our day-to-day

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,860
it helps us get faster turnaround time

29
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,200
from detection to actual response so you

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,180
can do the work that you need to do to

31
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,619
keep your companies and organization

32
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:11,939
safe

33
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,400
and also it just means you get to focus

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,080
on the things that matter and the

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,679
interesting parts

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,140
I have strong feelings about this topic

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,140
I started my career as a malware Analyst

38
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,000
at a government cyber security

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,400
operations center or we'll refer to them

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,119
as socks doing manual cue based work and

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,979
since then I have done detection and

42
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,720
response at companies as big as Facebook

43
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,900
and as small as 100 person startups

44
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,240
what I've always found is that the way

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,159
that we approach threat detection and

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,939
response we're Treading Water we have so

47
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,159
many alerts so little of them are High

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,960
Fidelity the things that are actually

49
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,180
incidents aren't usually coming through

50
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,000
our tooling we separate out analysts and

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,579
engineers and we expect them to operate

52
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:01,799
on outputs of tools that they haven't

53
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,180
written and they don't have any

54
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,759
ownership over

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,399
uh and so I want to share one of my

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,739
favorite quotes which is by Cliff Stoll

57
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,080
if you don't know about him I highly

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,420
recommend reading the Cuckoo's egg he's

59
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,300
pretty much the OG blue teamer and he

60
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,220
has a quote that goes

61
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,680
the first time I do something I'm a

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,720
scientist the second time I do something

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,239
I'm an engineer and the third time I do

64
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,760
something I'm a technician I want to be

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,720
a scientist so that's kind of the

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,060
mindset that we are applying to to this

67
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,099
uh this space

68
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,099
so the good news about all of this

69
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,900
manual toil and work that we do is

70
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,640
there's a shift that's been happening

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,099
and I've witnessed it over the 12 or so

72
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,560
years I've been in this field to apply

73
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,620
engineering focused Concepts

74
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,760
and that's what we're going to talk

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,700
about today and so for those of you who

76
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,580
don't know me I currently am at Asana

77
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,560
and we have started up our detection and

78
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,900
response program which if you couldn't

79
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,540
guess is engineering focused and so we

80
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,920
focus on a lot of the concepts that

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,660
we're going to talk about today things

82
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,060
like detection as code infrastructure as

83
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,180
code automation having really high

84
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,819
quality data Pipelines

85
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,640
and yeah so obviously I love talking

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,159
about this area but I decided what would

87
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,440
be better is to get people who are also

88
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,540
doing this work to talk about it with me

89
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,019
and share their perspectives so without

90
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,940
further Ado I'm going to turn it over to

91
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,739
our panelists so they can introduce

92
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,239
themselves tell you a little bit about

93
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,920
their backgrounds and why they're

94
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
excited about this topic so first I'll

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,299
go to you Louie yeah hey how's it going

96
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,879
folks I'm Louis Barrett for the past 10

97
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,260
years or so I've been working in both

98
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,000
detection response as well as instant

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,760
response these days I work in the AI

100
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,200
space in product security as well as

101
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,879
Cloud security I'm basically trying to

102
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,379
marry the two disciplines such that we

103
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,239
get better at building detections using

104
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,580
Ai and get better at security securing

105
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,860
AI using the detection work I've done in

106
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,480
the past really excited to talk to you

107
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,680
today

108
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,900
where are you currently I'm currently a

109
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,340
scale AI leading both product security

110
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,900
and Cloud security

111
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,280
and we're hiring

112
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,140
yes awesome Jessica

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,600
oh I gotta get closer to the mic I'm

114
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,978
being told

115
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,919
usually everyone tells me I'm too loud

116
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,500
um yes uh Jessica rezine I currently

117
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,020
work at Brax as a security operations

118
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,639
manager which includes the security

119
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,500
detection response function as well as

120
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,180
corporate security

121
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,100
um and I find my I found my way to the

122
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,540
wonderful world of security and scenario

123
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,580
spawns I started in tech support and

124
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,639
then I moved into a knock kind of a

125
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,240
junior sres type tile style role and I

126
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,100
just loved incidents like I'm that crazy

127
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,259
person I love a good crisis the world's

128
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,300
on fire and I'm having fun finding out

129
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,699
like where the burning pile of garbage

130
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,460
is but that pivot and I realized like my

131
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,780
favorite incidents were the security

132
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,180
incidents and that's how I came to the

133
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,620
detection response space it's like

134
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,900
hopping one crisis to another

135
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,280
um and I'm particularly excited about

136
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,780
this because I've been really fortunate

137
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,759
in my career that when I started out at

138
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,580
in a knock I got to witness the

139
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,680
transition to being less of a knock and

140
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,120
trying to be more engineering focused

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,220
and then in my security roles I've been

142
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,540
at smaller companies and had the

143
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,919
opportunity to help build a program

144
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,500
program which like lets me do more

145
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,479
engineering focused stuff so I'm like

146
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,280
super passionate like I have experienced

147
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,139
the benefit of detection engineering

148
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,419
like engineering first rather than the

149
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,740
sock model so that's why I was really

150
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,740
stoked to talk about that here today

151
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,500
awesome thank you Julie yeah I'm Julie

152
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,479
Sparks I'm a security engineer at Brooks

153
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:41,880
I currently work with Jess and you can

154
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,620
tell we align on a lot of things but

155
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,180
I've been in security for about seven

156
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,340
years started in GRC and then

157
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,600
transitioned over to detection and

158
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,180
response what really interests me is the

159
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,979
fact that you can apply these things

160
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:54,300
that we like learn about from other

161
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,880
Engineers software Engineers SRE and we

162
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,500
can take that and we can use those tools

163
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,820
to make detection and response more

164
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,039
efficient and give us more time to work

165
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,900
on threat detection and work on security

166
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,400
incidents some of the things that I'm

167
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,740
passionate about something else I really

168
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,479
love is that these engineering first

169
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,460
detection response teams we tend to help

170
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,620
each other we love to open source things

171
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,539
we love talking to each other about

172
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,740
these engineering problems and how we

173
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,780
can work together to solve them so that

174
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,400
maybe we all have the same size team but

175
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,720
the end of the day we're able to work on

176
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,340
more exciting problems and really

177
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,680
optimize what we're doing and that's

178
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,479
just been a Love of Mine

179
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,060
love it thank you all right let's get

180
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,500
into the nitty-gritty what are we

181
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,639
talking about when we're talking about

182
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,979
engineering first detection and response

183
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,660
so first we're going to start with

184
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,060
detection as code which I'm sure many of

185
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,800
you are familiar with this is a switch

186
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,259
to really owning your detection

187
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,060
signatures writing them into a code

188
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,020
repository using classic CI CD pipelines

189
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,960
and the the benefit here is that you

190
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,819
don't have to deal with signatures that

191
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,039
you have no idea who wrote them was it a

192
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,720
tool was it an analyst was it someone

193
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,819
who left your company six years ago and

194
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,680
put six random IPS into a deduction

195
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,500
signature we've all been there

196
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
um so there's a record

197
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,240
um and so Louis I'm wondering if you

198
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,639
could talk a little bit more about like

199
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,620
detection as code and why it has been

200
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,000
revolutionary

201
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,979
yeah so we lost that segment we had a

202
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,539
pretty small team and we had to be

203
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,940
detect um engineering first otherwise it

204
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,699
really wouldn't scale so for us we've

205
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,199
really benefited from having our

206
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,599
detections in Version Control allow the

207
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,340
engineers to comment on detections learn

208
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,020
from what people are building and have

209
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,639
more visibility across the team and what

210
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,660
was actually being done while we're

211
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,940
trying to detect it also let us know at

212
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,199
a point in time what were we able to

213
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,759
detect so you could actually go back and

214
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,960
say hey we would have caught x-ray

215
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,060
wouldn't have caught X based on

216
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,860
the detections we'd actually submit the

217
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,199
source control and you know even with

218
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,580
that being in place we could say like

219
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,080
hey if we have an incident come up we

220
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,419
know that we had a gap and we know how

221
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,680
to fill that Gap because we can

222
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,660
literally see you know what that Gap was

223
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,240
written into Source control additionally

224
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,099
it kind of like helps to deal with

225
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,479
crunch as well a lot of teams are under

226
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,460
this kind of crunch work style when you

227
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,319
have small teams but if you're able to

228
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,060
kind of push things through CI and test

229
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,199
whether that your detections actually

230
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,840
work you're less likely to rent an issue

231
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,520
in production where you're then having

232
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,380
to say okay this detection is failing

233
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,099
and we don't know it's failing yeah

234
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,539
alerts that were just generated exactly

235
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,539
why like knowing why is crucial to

236
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,099
detection so like we should definitely

237
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,419
be better at that when we're building

238
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:27,240
alerts yeah another point I think is

239
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,680
really important is when you are making

240
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,060
pull requests for your detections and

241
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,680
you're storing everything as code you

242
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,240
get the collaboration aspect that other

243
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,159
software Engineers benefit from we're

244
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,779
able to provide feedback work together

245
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,279
become a better detection engineer

246
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,539
because everyone on the team is looking

247
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,520
at it or at least a subset and you guys

248
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,899
are working together on what makes a

249
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,940
good detection and then all of that is

250
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,800
like historical like saved in the code

251
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,899
like the repo request and can be

252
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,279
referenced by people who are onboarding

253
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,480
or who want to learn more about what

254
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,100
you're doing

255
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,660
yeah and I think like the big thing

256
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,240
about detection is code is it offers

257
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,640
consistency repeatability collaboration

258
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,740
and things are just better when you have

259
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,959
that like you you know exactly what's in

260
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,279
your environment it's like just the next

261
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,080
step to being more mature in the space

262
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,420
is like you're not you're not expected

263
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,480
to write something sit look at all of

264
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,399
the data in the future be like oh what

265
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,440
would fire and in a traditional model

266
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,760
that's like kind of what you do you

267
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,320
don't have the tools to test what it's

268
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,839
going to do in sort of your seem prod

269
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,820
and still until you do it

270
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,440
um and it's just like a massive step

271
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,420
forward in maturity to be able to store

272
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,120
detections in a repository anywhere and

273
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,640
not just in whatever logging system is

274
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,680
running them for you totally and

275
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,080
speaking about maturity I think I would

276
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,220
be remiss to not talk about

277
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,200
infrastructure as code kind of this

278
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,140
concept where we're actually building

279
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,300
all of our Cloud infrastructure our data

280
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,899
pipelines our product in code so we have

281
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,720
again this like source of truth of what

282
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,920
infrastructure is set up what is it

283
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,120
going configurations and I mean one of

284
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,500
the big benefits of that is disaster

285
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,180
recovery right like things get blown

286
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,040
away you can send them back up but I

287
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,339
also think for us as Defenders it gives

288
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:08,399
us so many steps forward in

289
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
um like our processes because if we know

290
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,180
what infrastructure should look like

291
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,000
when it's drifted and also like we can

292
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,680
accurately threat models so much better

293
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,140
and so just yeah this is this is

294
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,880
something that's also like a little near

295
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,399
and dear to my heart is like

296
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,720
infrastructure is code it's just what

297
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,540
you do now and if you as a team are not

298
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,700
doing it you're behind your team's not

299
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,560
technically mature you're not really

300
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,660
sitting to play at the table with the

301
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,920
big dogs if you're talking to another

302
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,500
team that does infrastructure as code

303
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,899
and you don't it's like this is just a

304
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,700
core table Stakes for an engineering

305
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,380
team to do and like of course a

306
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,880
detection Response Team should be doing

307
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,779
it

308
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,540
yeah but there's and there's so many

309
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,339
ways you can do it

310
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,740
depends on what works best for you but

311
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,779
you need to be doing it be an adult put

312
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,000
on your big boy pants yeah it also comes

313
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,260
out like getting the respect of the

314
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,700
engineering teams you're going to ask to

315
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,560
make meaningful change if you're not

316
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,779
kind of like you know being toe-to-toe

317
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,700
with them and their capabilities let's

318
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,839
be frank like they're not going to

319
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:08,640
respect you as fellow engineers and we

320
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,899
can't really call ourselves Engineers

321
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,279
within security unless we're building

322
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,200
something contributing the way a

323
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,820
software engineer or infrastructure

324
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,899
engineer would

325
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:18,600
right yeah I think there's also like the

326
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,760
ability to scale up and down

327
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,260
um depending on like your pipelines

328
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,140
whatever alert

329
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,480
alert payload your handling

330
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,800
um there's a lot of these benefits that

331
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,300
come with having infrastructures code

332
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,680
and being able to add and subtract

333
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,600
resources as needed yeah it makes makes

334
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,640
your life is an engineer easy too

335
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,440
because you don't you you have an idea

336
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,459
of what's going on in your environment

337
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,500
you have those yeah absolutely I

338
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,720
remember one Friday evening of course

339
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,279
because you should make breaking changes

340
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,440
on Friday evenings always I blew away

341
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,860
all of our IM configurations in AWS but

342
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,740
thankfully terraform

343
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,000
so it's really a savior

344
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,519
oh yeah I mean I don't work for Hershey

345
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,540
court but

346
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,779
um so when you mentioned pipelines and

347
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,700
so something that we have to talk about

348
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,800
when we talk about detection and any

349
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,000
kind of threat detection is we're

350
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,240
operating on so much data so many

351
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
different logs from different places and

352
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,899
so there's this concept too that Julie

353
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,760
we were talking about about data

354
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,220
engineering and having like a really

355
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,019
clear process on how you're processing

356
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,760
all this information and storing it and

357
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,980
how you use it I wonder if you can yeah

358
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,560
so maybe this is my hot take but I think

359
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,180
that detection and response should have

360
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,220
more data engineering skills whether

361
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,079
that's having a data engineer on your

362
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,640
team or just having detection response

363
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,899
people that are familiar with data and

364
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,000
can work on these pipelines but at the

365
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,320
end of the day you're not going to have

366
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,060
good quality detections if you don't

367
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,680
have the data to write those detections

368
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,560
on so data quality where you're able to

369
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,060
ingest logs from understanding what

370
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,100
those logs are and for a lot of teams

371
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,860
that also means understanding the load

372
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,360
of data you're going to be bringing in

373
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,920
and whether it's cost efficient for what

374
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,060
you're going to need in an incident or

375
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,839
whether you're going to need for a

376
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,019
detection further on so I think focusing

377
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,420
on data engineering as a problem and

378
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,880
something that can really up uplift your

379
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,980
detection work and making that like a

380
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,620
foundational piece is really important

381
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,420
at Brooks we we open source substation

382
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,300
which is a way to deploy serverless data

383
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,360
pipelines to collect logs we are able to

384
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,579
collect logs store them pre-process and

385
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,800
post-process after they're enriched and

386
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,360
so that gives us the benefit of being

387
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,860
able to store the data have it raw but

388
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,180
also be able to perform any

389
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,459
Transformations we want on the data so

390
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,260
maybe we want to add certain role

391
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,760
enrichments we want to like make custom

392
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,920
hashes based on certain patterns and

393
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,120
then we can utilize those in our

394
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,920
detections but all of that can only

395
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,139
exist because we have control over our

396
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,880
logging pipelines and what happens to

397
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,040
our data and does anyone have a story to

398
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,480
share of like what it would have looked

399
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,459
like trying to do that if you had a

400
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,260
scene instead of like controlling your

401
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,940
own data pipelines it wouldn't have

402
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,100
happened

403
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,660
because you just don't have access to

404
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,880
like some vendor has sort of given you

405
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
this box and they go here you go it does

406
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,760
all your logs it does all your

407
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,620
detections but they don't give you that

408
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,139
control to get in and actually see how

409
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,760
well they're handling your data and they

410
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,019
might not be doing it very well and you

411
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,760
could just be stuck with whatever their

412
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,399
slos slis are yeah and I feel I feel

413
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,320
like we've talked a bit about kind of

414
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,540
this like build versus buy

415
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,660
um mentality and I personally feel like

416
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,579
there is a balance between sometimes you

417
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,040
do want to buy vendor Solutions but you

418
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,660
should have a framework or a way that

419
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,220
you're thinking about what you're what

420
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,600
you're building versus what you're

421
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,880
buying and so I'm wondering for any of

422
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,160
you have like stories about where you

423
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,540
made that trade-off how you think about

424
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,680
it

425
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,480
yeah I think there's this underlying

426
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,180
concept that

427
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,519
you have way more flexibility to build

428
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,139
if you have teams who have also

429
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,660
engineering like like skills otherwise

430
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,339
if you're just if you have a team of

431
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,660
analysts and they're working within a

432
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,459
tool you're kind of just going to buy a

433
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:52,079
new tool for them to work on but if you

434
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,000
also have Engineers on your team who are

435
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,380
building the tools that you use to do

436
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,600
the detections like that's kind of where

437
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,220
the magic happens and build isn't even

438
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,019
possible in a situation where you're not

439
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:03,240
focusing on engineering first no 100

440
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,699
true I think we also need to like

441
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:07,740
kind of nudge vendors to build tools

442
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,720
that support the ability to extend and

443
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,040
integrate because without that

444
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,240
capability we're never going to be able

445
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,860
to build anything that's hybrid and

446
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,300
we'll always be in this situation where

447
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,339
we're you know at the mercy of these

448
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,680
vendors to give us you know data fields

449
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,480
like strings where they should be IPS

450
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,399
and everything we know that should be

451
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,839
right and they're just not doing this

452
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,339
for us so they need to kind of move in

453
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,600
the direction of detection engineering

454
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,820
and you can just fix it yourself if you

455
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,920
have yeah not a string should be but

456
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,720
yeah let's do it I'm going to give like

457
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,240
a big plus one to that extensibility the

458
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,100
ability to work with a product and have

459
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,680
it be able to be molded to your

460
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,720
environment and have control over like

461
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,180
what's going in and coming out is just

462
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,100
revolutionary rather than I mean I'm not

463
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,500
going to name any names but just like

464
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,880
buying you know your classic big name

465
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,740
Sims and you have to learn their

466
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,500
proprietary you know query language and

467
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,300
you have to do everything in this very

468
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,579
specific way that probably doesn't

469
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:00,779
really have anything to do with your

470
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,579
environment and additionally like those

471
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,560
skills don't transfer right like exactly

472
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,420
you get this like lock-in or where you

473
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,920
as a professional now can't grow because

474
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,500
you've only used vendor X and vendor X's

475
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,060
skills are not transferable to vendor

476
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,760
why critical think we're starting a

477
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,160
revolution I think we're like looking at

478
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,959
fictional response engineering teams are

479
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,040
going to take back the power from

480
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,959
vendors because if they're not giving us

481
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,760
what we want we can build hybrid

482
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,860
solutions that take over that and take

483
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,040
note vendors in the room yeah get scared

484
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,899
or work with us or open up your

485
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,660
platforms so we can really yeah really

486
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,339
customize them yeah I think that's one

487
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:36,839
of the successes I've seen a lot with

488
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,660
like our open source like toolkit is it

489
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,399
doesn't do what we want let's change it

490
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,920
like oh we have a cool new idea like we

491
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,259
have uh checks like you can't ship a bad

492
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,540
config for this environment anymore but

493
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,920
we could only do that because we built

494
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,600
it ourselves not because a vendor would

495
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,000
have allowed us to do that yeah I did

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,560
want to go back to your comment about

497
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,800
how sometimes we have kind of this

498
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,240
ceiling that we put on when we have

499
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,560
analysts come in and they're only

500
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,540
working on these proprietary tools and

501
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,240
they become experts in one you know

502
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,919
query I'm really trying hard not to say

503
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,559
a vendor name right now

504
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,880
but as a hiring manager and I know we

505
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,980
have like other like people involved in

506
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,839
this when I see a resume and your

507
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,760
experience is nine years working with

508
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,099
one proprietary scripting like query

509
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,199
language that just has to do with this

510
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,339
one tool

511
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,640
I can't see how I can slot you in to the

512
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,839
like the current kind of like

513
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,360
engineering focused approach and I would

514
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,940
say that is not dunking on the analyst

515
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,500
that's dunking on the companies that

516
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,120
don't give the opportunities for you to

517
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,379
have extensible skills

518
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,320
[Laughter]

519
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,140
word all right I want to talk a bit

520
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,919
about the noise and prioritization and

521
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,480
so we know that working and threat

522
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,480
detection response where our scope is so

523
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,840
uh it's so large and I mean Jessica you

524
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,520
talked about you own corpsec as well so

525
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,020
it's not just incident response it's not

526
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,340
just threat detection it's also

527
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,419
corporate security and asset control and

528
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,760
the the issue too is right we're not

529
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,280
working on systems that are static or

530
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,080
not changing we're not working with

531
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,580
threat actors who aren't changing what

532
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,039
they're doing every day and so there's

533
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,600
so much that we could focus on and

534
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,679
there's so many things that we could

535
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,200
focus on we have vendors we have

536
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,179
organizations like miter telling us what

537
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,799
we should be focused on we have

538
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,840
Frameworks that were written 10 15 years

539
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,400
ago that tell us we need to be focused

540
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,260
on certain things how do you

541
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,840
operationally know what to focus on when

542
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,360
you're building out your detections and

543
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,760
I'm gonna throw it to you Louie so I

544
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,260
think it really comes down to threat

545
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,580
modeling your environment and using

546
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,860
Frameworks internally that makes sense

547
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,059
um one that I really like is kind of

548
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:47,520
this High exposure versus low risk to

549
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,740
low exposure high-risk type of map and

550
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,539
what that basically looks like is if you

551
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,820
have uh say an external system that's

552
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,799
customer facing right you have a lot of

553
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,059
control of that system typically because

554
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,799
you designed it you can put security

555
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,780
controls in place but it shouldn't

556
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,000
really be something that's high risk

557
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,280
versus the other side of the spectrum

558
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,419
there where you have your cloud system

559
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:07,980
is that might have very very low

560
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,480
exposure no one really sees this except

561
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,760
injuries with admin access but the risk

562
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,840
is very high of something were to go

563
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,299
wrong so focusing on either side of that

564
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,740
actual diagram tends to be really

565
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,780
impactful because you get the swath of

566
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,100
people who are trying to attack you

567
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,380
while also focusing on the systems that

568
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,640
are most critical in terms of things

569
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,960
actually going wrong in your environment

570
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,720
so with that in mind like I've always

571
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,640
worked on very small security teams and

572
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,140
we've had to prioritize because we can't

573
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,640
bring it we can't log everything I never

574
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,900
believe we should log everything else

575
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,000
it's expensive it's so expensive an

576
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,919
insane Paradigm that only your vendor

577
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,900
wants you to do for more money right

578
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,059
vendors I see you in the room

579
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:43,860
um yeah so like basically focusing on

580
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,620
the things that you believe as your

581
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,960
organization have the highest risk put

582
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,280
your logs there right and then really

583
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,720
you get to know those logs and learn

584
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,820
them yeah so rather than like that

585
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,500
breadth first let's do everything let's

586
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,120
log everything let's actually look at

587
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,799
what the threats are to our organization

588
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,620
and like every company every team is

589
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,000
going to have different threat models

590
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,679
like there are different attackers

591
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,059
there's different threat vectors and

592
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,400
trying to apply a one-size-fits all it's

593
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,600
just gonna

594
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,220
it's going to give you too many alerts

595
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,780
it's just it's not going to be a good

596
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,100
time this is something I would love

597
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,620
Julie to comment on because she because

598
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,580
she actually

599
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,260
did something which has been really an

600
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,120
incredible prioritization tool for the

601
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,240
team that I reference constantly

602
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,400
yeah hoping to actually probably open

603
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,020
source us but it's a way of thinking

604
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,539
about log prioritization so went back to

605
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:32,100
this whole thing like my hot take is the

606
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,660
data engineering

607
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,059
um but what logs you ingest how you

608
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,820
store them and what is in those logs um

609
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,220
should all be prioritized basically for

610
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,720
incidents for detections you need these

611
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,820
logs but you only have a team of three

612
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,919
people so how do you choose which logs

613
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,980
to ingest and what data to keep and how

614
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,440
long you keep it for and for us we have

615
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,280
like

616
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,380
more frequent storage where we can like

617
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,179
access it immediately in frequent where

618
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:59,220
it's a more expensive to query and so we

619
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,600
have to make decisions

620
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,460
um based on our budget and how much data

621
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,780
we're bringing in where do we put each

622
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,940
and when do we spend time ingesting

623
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,919
those logs and I think having that

624
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,799
conversation internally looking at

625
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,820
um there's a couple different ways you

626
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,919
can look at it from like the risk of the

627
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,020
the logs the platform itself or the logs

628
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,940
are coming from you can look at like how

629
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,799
is that platform secured how often are

630
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,660
you having incidents with that and use

631
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,280
all these different factors to determine

632
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,960
what is the priority of ingesting those

633
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,760
logs how do we store them and then

634
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,440
making sure those are available and like

635
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,360
planning your quarters around that so

636
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,799
that you keep getting logs in you're

637
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,120
making sure that you're moving towards

638
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,559
the progress of having everything you

639
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,240
need to do those incident response

640
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,860
actions those threat detection actions

641
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,780
yeah and so so what we have as a team

642
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,340
now is we have Internal Documentation

643
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,679
the log prioritization framework it's

644
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,320
there it's documented logs come out to

645
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,600
high medium low risk depending on like

646
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,340
the context of our environment the

647
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,320
framework is very specific to like what

648
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,720
we are where our customer data is and

649
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,000
because of this we have a prioritized

650
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,460
backlog of high medium low log sources

651
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,840
and we're like cool what are we doing

652
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,520
next we just pick them up off the top of

653
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,679
the pile and then those conversations

654
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,539
for me as a manager become a lot easier

655
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,400
because I have conversations about how

656
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,740
much our tools cost and I get to write

657
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,780
documents that justify the cost of our

658
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,520
tools and when we have a frame where

659
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,960
it's like look we think about this in a

660
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,240
really mature way it also makes all of

661
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,520
those managery like conversations like

662
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,020
talking about budgeting and like what

663
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,240
the real value is because we've been

664
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,940
prioritizing like so consistently over

665
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,679
time like Finance is like okay you're

666
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,539
actually doing a pretty good job and how

667
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,360
how do you leverage these to talk about

668
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,860
the things that you're not prioritizing

669
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,600
because I know as security teams I joke

670
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,700
with my team that a lot of what we do is

671
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,679
emotional triage because people come to

672
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,140
us and they're like I'm scared there's a

673
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,400
there's something weird that is

674
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,320
happening and you have to talk to them

675
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,419
in a reasonable way about what you're

676
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,280
prioritizing why you're prioritizing it

677
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,159
and so I'm wondering how you Leverage

678
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:55,140
kind of these systems are these like

679
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,539
processes to do that yeah it's I think

680
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,460
what happens most commonly is someone

681
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,640
who has a little bit of knowledge about

682
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,400
the space makes a suggestion that at the

683
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,720
surface level sounds incredibly

684
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,159
reasonable so like as part of these

685
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,720
conversations talking about where we

686
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,000
want to log this Source not this Source

687
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,620
we think this is more important a

688
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,059
regular one that comes up is like oh

689
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,980
what about Network things what about VPC

690
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,380
flow logs and I was like do you know the

691
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,620
volume

692
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,380
um but it becomes like out of a place of

693
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,000
a lack of knowledge from them and

694
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,460
because we have just like this is how we

695
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,080
think about it this is how we prioritize

696
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,820
it's much much easier to have a

697
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,280
conversation about a framework in place

698
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,580
to do this rather than like no you're

699
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,500
dumb or like like pushing someone off

700
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,000
and making them feel bad you get to read

701
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,400
them into how you do it rather than them

702
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,140
feeling like you ignore them or blow

703
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,100
them off because you didn't listen to

704
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,360
them and it becomes like self-service

705
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,460
too like Louie I'm wondering yeah yeah I

706
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,539
find that super helpful in the past

707
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:52,799
because like just pointing people to the

708
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,600
document station you have as to how you

709
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,820
think about logging tends to alleviate

710
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,659
their fears and usually have

711
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:59,100
compensating logs they weren't aware of

712
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,620
like we think about VPC flow logs and

713
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,659
VPC Vlogs will have DNS logs are useless

714
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,220
so like is there a better way of getting

715
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,020
that context there often is right and as

716
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,640
long as people can see that they're less

717
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,100
focused or hyper focused on the thing

718
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,080
they think is scary like an additional

719
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,280
kind I want to make on this was around

720
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,500
like documentation in general and kind

721
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,179
of back to our original infrastructures

722
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,460
code detection is code questions here

723
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,440
these things are self-documenting once

724
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,520
you actually put them in place so it

725
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
becomes a lot easier to have these

726
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,000
discussions after the fact because

727
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,440
you're codifying these things so people

728
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,419
can go back and reference them

729
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,159
that's a really good call out because

730
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,500
the documentation also makes it easier

731
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,659
for you to onboard people to your teams

732
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:40,080
as well as stakeholders and compliance

733
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,500
efforts

734
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,799
our jrc team loves us like working with

735
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,419
us like you're on top of it and we're

736
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,280
like oh it's because we just we write

737
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,620
down how we do the thing and that's like

738
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,480
a huge amount of like what compliance

739
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,240
and grp yeah infras code infras code

740
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,400
makes um the GRC audits like very happy

741
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,880
times yeah it doesn't have to be very

742
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,100
hard to make GRC happy it's actually

743
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,539
like

744
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,640
can be quite simple when you focus on

745
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,960
the things that matter yeah and I'll

746
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,280
give like a little shout out to someone

747
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,580
on our GRC team Alan you're amazing um

748
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,020
but he'll he'll he will look at

749
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,000
something or be pulling evidence from a

750
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,280
ticket and he'll go find the ticket from

751
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,280
last year where it's a specific place in

752
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,980
a GitHub repo that I linked that shows

753
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,840
like yes this is this is the connection

754
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,700
of the logging for this thing and then

755
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,500
he just goes and he's like wait this is

756
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,120
what you showed me last year is this the

757
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,500
same page like am I right and I was like

758
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,940
yes you're right just show to the

759
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,919
auditor again and the consistency of

760
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,960
having it documented in the code repo

761
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,419
which is also like self updating

762
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,520
essentially is massively helpful for

763
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,159
like my peace of mind when it comes like

764
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,320
audit season I try to keep the team out

765
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,720
of it and I can usually because they've

766
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,880
documented the work awesome I want to

767
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,740
talk a little bit about Automation and

768
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,240
especially like automating manual

769
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,440
processes and I think here I I think a

770
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,960
lot about how we saw this revolution

771
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,240
when it started to adopt engineering

772
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,460
practices and devops so I'm wondering

773
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,200
and I'm going to say it are we in like a

774
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,320
sec Dev detection Ops Revolution is that

775
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,020
what we're fighting for here yeah okay I

776
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,860
hate acronyms too but yes it pains me a

777
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,260
little bit to say yes to that and I

778
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,940
mentioned earlier like I started out my

779
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,700
career in a knock in a knock that moved

780
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,580
from like into a more devops approach so

781
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,260
I feel super super passionately about

782
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,520
this

783
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,039
um yes devops is the future and I think

784
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,600
all this comes down to a very Central

785
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,840
like human behavioral idea of ownership

786
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,380
if you own a system you own it

787
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,760
um which means you have the skills to

788
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,860
maintain it you have the ability to say

789
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,140
no when other people want to touch your

790
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,240
system and you can like make changes

791
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,340
when you need it and if you feel the

792
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,679
pain when that system breaks you're

793
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,900
going to build an excellent system and

794
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,120
if you have any of those things split to

795
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,799
other teams you can't control your own

796
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,600
destiny things are going to get worse

797
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,059
but when Engineering Systems break if

798
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,520
you can fix them and you feel the acute

799
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,279
terrible 3 A.M this is the worst pain

800
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,200
when they break you better believe

801
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,700
you're going to fix that the next day

802
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,679
but if it's an analyst that feels that

803
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,539
pain and some engineer over there hears

804
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,340
about it like theoretically they're not

805
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,900
going to make any effort like really

806
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,640
emotionally to fix that thing you just

807
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,400
have misaligned incentives so in my mind

808
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,279
like devops helps bring the right

809
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,080
incentive structure and sense of

810
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,940
ownership like to work and I don't do

811
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,799
you can really have an excellent like

812
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,779
system if those incentives aren't

813
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,400
aligned correctly

814
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,080
and directly the reason vendors aren't

815
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,220
really here to help you right they're

816
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,840
not living your life they're not feeling

817
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,520
the pain points that you're feeling and

818
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,140
until they are we won't really get

819
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,460
better products so we do have to be the

820
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,260
ones pushing them to make these things

821
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,640
extensible to give us some more of that

822
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,159
control back yeah and I think when we

823
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:54,900
talk about automation something that I

824
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,580
hear often when I talk to people like

825
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,980
especially people who are in analyst

826
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,200
roles now or have spent a lot of time in

827
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,919
like classically more analyst type roles

828
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,539
they are like well you can never

829
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,460
automate out the people from threat

830
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,260
section response like and it's something

831
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,760
that I think

832
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,440
is very like

833
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,500
uh gets spicy quickly and I want to say

834
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,240
I don't think any of us are thinking

835
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,220
that we can automate subject matter

836
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,820
experts out of this process but what I'm

837
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,380
talking about instead is instead of

838
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,880
having someone on the factory line

839
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,740
dealing with things that are coming out

840
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,419
of a black box giving them the ability

841
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,520
to actually modify the factory and

842
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,440
change what's coming out like Jessica

843
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,299
said it's the ability to control your

844
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:39,059
own destiny and the ability to apply

845
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,100
your specific knowledge and threat

846
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,080
detection and threat actors and how to

847
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,940
protect companies and actually be able

848
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,260
to do

849
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,679
the cool work of like hunting and red

850
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,840
teaming without having to be stuck under

851
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,520
well I have 5 000 alerts to look at

852
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,500
today so um and I have no idea what this

853
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,320
IP address is yeah I think it's like

854
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,760
time allocation if you think about it

855
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,200
you only have so many hours in the day

856
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,480
detection Response Team handle a lot of

857
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,620
things if they're engineering first

858
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,779
they're engineering building new systems

859
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,340
they might be building incident response

860
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,539
automation they're going to be writing

861
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,679
detections they're doing threat research

862
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,539
you might be doing threat hunting like

863
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:13,740
you're doing a lot of different things

864
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,779
and you really want to free up time so

865
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:16,679
that people can be doing those

866
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:17,820
interesting things and they're not

867
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,980
burning themselves out looking at alerts

868
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,539
or handling the same thing over and over

869
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,580
again and so like I really like this

870
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,159
like way of viewing automation as just a

871
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,620
tool to make your team better not a tool

872
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,240
to remove people

873
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,980
yeah I think a pretty key example there

874
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,659
is kind of in just the alert and

875
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,520
enrichment type pipelines if it looks

876
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,740
building out and you know these things

877
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,480
should serve to make every one of our

878
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,580
analysts a bit faster and also kind of

879
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,899
spread the knowledge of our senior

880
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:44,399
analysts more widely saying here's a

881
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,080
process I would follow this process is

882
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,480
now codified as a script or an

883
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,220
enrichment Runner such that anyone who's

884
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,480
more Junior picking this up can

885
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,860
immediately benefit from the experience

886
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,179
of others

887
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,460
yeah and when when you're like looking

888
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,679
at a thing in front of you and you need

889
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,340
to do it faster if you can control the

890
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,260
system that's emitting the alert you can

891
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,820
control the system that's providing you

892
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,559
with the enrichment like yeah I'm gonna

893
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,539
take that extra five ten minutes out of

894
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,279
my day so that I'm one minute quicker

895
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,140
every other time just like crops up in

896
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,760
the future yeah potential gains yeah

897
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,080
yeah and I think like the alert

898
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,360
management system that uh you and Josh

899
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,860
built for the team is like a really good

900
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,899
example of trying to take all that stuff

901
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,600
and put it all in one place all in

902
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,000
one spot that gives someone the ability

903
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,620
to do all the information they need like

904
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:32,039
just go like why stop yeah I think a key

905
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,320
part is also like looking at how alerts

906
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,220
are coming in like the point where

907
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,539
you're making the detection to where

908
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,100
like an analyst or an engineer is

909
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,960
responding to it how can you make that

910
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,880
process like faster and easier for

911
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,200
people whether that's like incident

912
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,419
response automation for us it was also

913
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:46,799
like looking at the context of every

914
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,200
alert before it gets to the um end on

915
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,539
call so that we can suppress and

916
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,760
de-duplicate alerts more efficiently so

917
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,980
we're not getting if the system spikes

918
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,120
we're not getting a thousand alerts

919
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,340
because something that it did download a

920
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,720
script on every endpoint and we want

921
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,159
like an alert from every single one of

922
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,240
those like it's going to see that it's

923
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,440
the same script that's running and we're

924
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,779
going to get one alert to triage

925
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,220
um and looking at ways to do that so

926
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,539
that you're spending less time doing

927
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,279
this like repetitive work where you're

928
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,080
doing these like investigations that are

929
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,000
probably benign but you still need to do

930
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,320
them and you're able to like free up

931
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,360
that time to like hey there's like a new

932
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,919
threat research article that came out

933
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,840
and I want to write a detection and so

934
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,340
just like giving the power back to the

935
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,919
individual yeah so it's like once you

936
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,679
see something and when you see it for

937
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:29,940
the first time you want the context

938
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,679
there to not have to go to a bunch of

939
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,380
other systems or like and have like you

940
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,240
know 40 tabs open as you're trying to

941
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,860
figure out where this came from and what

942
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,380
it means and also once you see something

943
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,779
getting all the contacts there great but

944
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,880
then do you need to see it again ever

945
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,299
like if I'm triaging an alert and it's

946
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,279
not relevant or it needs to be tuned or

947
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,419
something I never want to have to

948
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,279
process it again

949
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,679
um so yeah yeah I think you touch a

950
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,080
little bit like on burnout incident

951
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,000
response roles detection response

952
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,039
humerals are really burnout prone

953
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,059
because you have the high pressure

954
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,039
you're doing an incident response like

955
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,720
any given you could just have a terrible

956
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,740
week

957
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,559
um and yeah like it's like death by a

958
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,299
Thousand Cuts I would see it in your

959
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:13,799
like your day-to-day life that alert's

960
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,120
really annoying and you like sling it

961
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,100
away like oh it's fine um but the

962
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,120
automation really gives people the

963
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,220
opportunity to make their life better

964
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,320
yeah I sleep in hand since they have a

965
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,659
place basically with automation yeah as

966
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,100
possible it makes your life better but

967
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,539
it also speeds up if you're in a real

968
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:29,720
incident

969
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,980
where there's that like pressure like

970
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,360
there's like a million bricks on your

971
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,039
shoulders and you're like struggling to

972
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,179
breathe and you're like I have a million

973
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:37,919
things to do right now well like you can

974
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,299
automate some of that away whether

975
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:40,679
that's like the incident like process

976
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:41,880
handling writing the documentation

977
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,460
whether that's isolating laptops all of

978
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,020
these things make it easier so that like

979
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,640
it's not as much pressure on a small

980
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,539
tune

981
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,760
that's really well said

982
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,279
um I have one last question for each of

983
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,740
you which is about what you're excited

984
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,480
about for the future or kind of things

985
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,820
that are on your mind and then I want to

986
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,279
open it up to any of you who want to ask

987
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,140
us questions and kind of pick the brains

988
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,840
of the panelists here so I'll start with

989
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,600
you Louie what are you excited about

990
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,740
yeah so I'm definitely most excited

991
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,860
about like the using AI to make our jobs

992
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,360
easier security Engineers I think

993
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,620
there's an opportunity in basically

994
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,019
every part of security to do this if

995
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:20,519
you're an application security you can

996
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,799
use language models to essentially look

997
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,720
over a block of code and see if this is

998
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,580
risky or includes any like known

999
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,799
vulnerabilities on the instant response

1000
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,360
side you can use the summarize instant

1001
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,860
Communications basically removing the

1002
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,879
need for instant Commander

1003
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,380
but like really being able to summarize

1004
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,580
this especially when you're dropped into

1005
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,100
it like as a newcomer it can be like

1006
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,840
really you know challenging to scroll

1007
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,039
back up through that instant and figure

1008
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,960
out what's going on it's really nice if

1009
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,820
you can just say hey AI summarize the

1010
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,399
last comms what items are open what

1011
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:00,659
items are still in progress who are

1012
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,039
things assigned to so there's a lot of

1013
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,960
opportunity in this space and we as

1014
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,700
security people need to like actually

1015
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,740
look at what's possible for these

1016
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,179
technology and like feed this back into

1017
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,280
our work sorry do you work for an AI

1018
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,710
company

1019
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,800
[Music]

1020
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:19,800
all right Jessica how about you

1021
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,199
um I so I've like recently actually got

1022
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,520
a really

1023
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,619
excited about

1024
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:28,320
like what ways we can take detection or

1025
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,879
response like skill sets and move them

1026
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,739
like elsewhere in the organization and

1027
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,780
like very specifically for me I right

1028
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,760
now am fascinated with the financial

1029
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,619
fraud space

1030
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:39,599
um so at brex we have we have like a

1031
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,219
fraud compliance like org that is

1032
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,020
separate from us but we collaborate um

1033
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,879
when we do have like incident level

1034
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,399
stuff when like fraud has stuff and I'm

1035
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,500
so fascinated like the work is so

1036
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,659
analogous but using different tools

1037
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,280
you're detecting slightly different

1038
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,159
things but also there's the security

1039
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,440
aspect too so I'm increasingly excited

1040
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,000
about like how can we take the cool

1041
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,920
stuff detections response does and like

1042
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,380
apply it to other places within the

1043
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,580
company because I think that we also

1044
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,859
like our team specifically has a lot of

1045
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:10,140
data engineering like chops and skills

1046
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,700
that we can also share too so it's like

1047
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,079
that's the part I'm also excited about

1048
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,640
like I love textual response and being

1049
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,619
able to like take what we do to other

1050
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,300
spaces that are really adjacent is like

1051
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,579
that's my my new my new thing I'm on

1052
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,380
right now it really is applicable across

1053
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,940
domains I think sometimes we Silo

1054
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,140
ourselves and we're like we do this very

1055
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,700
specific thing but what we're actually

1056
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,500
doing like the meat of it is so

1057
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,060
applicable to others one thing that also

1058
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,160
keeps me too is um like alert management

1059
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,160
and cue management like a support cue

1060
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,260
like we kind of do that like we actually

1061
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,700
have a lot of ability to tell people

1062
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,440
like why are you doing that just turn

1063
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,880
that off there's no value and other

1064
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,520
people don't think to do that in some

1065
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,680
ways yeah so I think we have a lot to

1066
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,599
share

1067
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,880
all right Julie yeah so one thing I've

1068
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,560
been thinking a lot about is how we're

1069
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,660
writing detections and how they exist in

1070
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,400
the system and I think that the

1071
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,140
traditional way is like you write like a

1072
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,780
query and proprietary language of some

1073
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,160
sort and then you store it and it's

1074
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,960
looking for a specific behavior and then

1075
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,180
you match on it but it doesn't have this

1076
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,520
versatility to it um I think like a more

1077
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,960
modular approach where you're maybe

1078
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,240
writing logic that's behaviors and then

1079
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,920
you chain those behaviors together to

1080
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,780
represent a technique or an attack that

1081
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,880
you've seen and then that way

1082
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,920
um when you're as a detection you only

1083
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,599
tune a small part or you're able to add

1084
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,680
all these parts together that you've

1085
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,020
already built into a new detection and I

1086
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,660
think that versatility and modularity is

1087
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,800
going to be really important and

1088
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,079
actually like showcasing showcasing the

1089
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,240
skills of the deduction engineers and

1090
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,680
actually modeling the attacker's

1091
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,020
behaviors in a more sustainable way so

1092
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,640
you're not constantly editing or writing

1093
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,680
new detections when one little aspect of

1094
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,819
their technique has changed

1095
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,619
what if you told us what

1096
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:48,500
what AI

1097
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,640
you're getting kicked off the panel

1098
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,859
sorry excuse me

1099
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,200
I want to say quickly what I'm excited

1100
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,700
about is just people sharing what

1101
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,020
they're working on I want to just give a

1102
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,820
shout out to Brax like part of why I was

1103
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,619
excited to have y'all on the panel is

1104
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,920
you're both creating new systems but

1105
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,240
you're writing about it and you're

1106
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,740
sharing what you're doing and I think a

1107
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,660
lot of us don't realize how interesting

1108
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,700
what we're doing is and how interesting

1109
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,680
it is for other people so like please

1110
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,440
you know do talks write blogs it really

1111
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,599
helps other people and open source your

1112
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,740
stuff

1113
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,520
and AI

1114
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,300
and Ai and AI yeah yeah all right do we

1115
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,520
have questions yeah before we open up

1116
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,800
the questions I just want everybody to

1117
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,660
give a round of applause for these oh

1118
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,560
thank you

1119
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,360
[Applause]

1120
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,300
[Music]

1121
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,079
all right so um

1122
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,359
they have a lot of enduring fans it's

1123
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:51,359
just me so if if anybody has a question

1124
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,780
just raise your hand and I'll try to

1125
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,280
pass you to Mike because they can't hear

1126
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,380
you from up there especially I also

1127
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,960
really can't see you yeah they can't see

1128
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,760
you either the lights are bright so if

1129
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,500
you could come down a little

1130
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,520
foreign

1131
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,599
I'm an old man

1132
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,160
uh I think it was Louis you said but

1133
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,900
this is a question for any of y'all I'm

1134
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,020
curious what you think but curious how

1135
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,119
you feel detection as code has enabled

1136
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,060
you or not to validate whether now your

1137
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,500
detection is actually catching what

1138
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,700
you're looking for I think Louis you

1139
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,619
mentioned like looking back and saying

1140
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,000
oh we should have caught that or not is

1141
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,859
that something that detectionist code

1142
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:33,480
has enabled you to kind of program in

1143
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,339
events plant flags that you're looking

1144
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,680
for or uh yeah what's the deal there

1145
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,320
yeah so we actually along with the

1146
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,460
Texans code actually have the

1147
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,079
adversaries as code as a part of our

1148
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,060
testing pipeline such that when we write

1149
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,440
the detection we also have an

1150
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,240
adversarial test that should trigger

1151
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,240
that event right so if we're not

1152
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,440
essentially testing our detections we're

1153
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,300
not really doing the the full job of

1154
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,560
knowing that this works we're just

1155
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,579
throwing something over the fence and

1156
00:38:56,579 --> 00:38:57,900
hoping it will actually detect something

1157
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,480
so definitely big enough like codifying

1158
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,940
attacker behavior and making that the

1159
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,800
testing mechanism for actual detections

1160
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,040
no

1161
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,280
next question

1162
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:21,119
raise your hand

1163
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,440
though I think someone's just walking

1164
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,700
around we can

1165
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,180
yeah we can we can talk more about

1166
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,820
um kind of others question

1167
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,300
cool

1168
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,960
what are some of the hardest parts about

1169
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,020
making this revolution dream a reality

1170
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,520
for each of you hiring yep

1171
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,140
okay tell me more about that what is it

1172
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,780
about hiring that makes it

1173
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,720
I I feel really fortunate that

1174
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,119
um the I

1175
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,640
was hired in to be a manager of a team

1176
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,380
that already had like an engineering

1177
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,599
Focus to it and I got like lucky there

1178
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,099
are people who are already there and and

1179
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:04,920
hired before I arrived

1180
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,960
um so yeah but hiring like was a

1181
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,220
challenge like trying to find another

1182
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,099
person finding someone who has a mix of

1183
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:13,079
the software development like skill sets

1184
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,540
and then also the operational ability to

1185
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,119
do an actual like incident response and

1186
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,980
run the incident is like a really

1187
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,960
challenging overlap to find because you

1188
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,460
you're typically finding people who have

1189
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,740
more of an analyst background like they

1190
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,940
don't they haven't been giving an

1191
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,680
opportunity to do both those things yeah

1192
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,200
hiring is very hard yeah I think another

1193
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,540
thing is like leadership buy-in so if

1194
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,740
you're at a company where you have

1195
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,540
security leadership that are behind this

1196
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,540
idea of having like hiring predominantly

1197
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,099
engineer people with engineering skill

1198
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:42,660
sets and doing this like detection and

1199
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,200
response um engineering first style then

1200
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,880
you have a lot of support and that's

1201
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,859
great but there's a lot of companies

1202
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:51,060
that are maybe a little bit older school

1203
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,640
that see security response as having to

1204
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,740
be a sock and so being able to push

1205
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,180
change for that I think is going to be

1206
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,500
really really difficult like I think

1207
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,700
that's why you see a lot of detection

1208
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,040
and response teams at newer tech

1209
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,960
companies newer startups because they

1210
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,880
were able to start the team from scratch

1211
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,859
with engineering first principles rather

1212
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:09,180
than having to go back and change

1213
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,640
everyone's perceptions and get buy-in

1214
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,980
yeah absolutely we have another question

1215
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,020
here okay

1216
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,460
okay

1217
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,420
non-hiring challenge

1218
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,440
I mean the only thing I've seen was like

1219
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,079
try and break folks off that uh reactive

1220
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,300
mindset into a proactive one because

1221
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,820
like you could have the like a brand new

1222
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,960
engineering program we're like yes we

1223
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,400
won't be engineering first but then you

1224
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,720
have analysts who are only used to being

1225
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,820
reactive yeah and kind of like breaking

1226
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,680
them out of that mindset of hey I have

1227
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,720
to react right and I'm like no yes spend

1228
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,520
two hours build a good detection and it

1229
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,720
will save you time later it's getting

1230
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,220
people like into that bought into that

1231
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,839
idea basically for sure I call it the

1232
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,540
reactive wheel of hell where you are so

1233
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,740
stuck in operational work that

1234
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,940
everything is coming in at the same

1235
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,560
volume and severity and you're just

1236
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,820
running around with your hands on fire

1237
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,160
setting everything else on fire

1238
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,000
um no one relates to that

1239
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,320
[Laughter]

1240
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,000
hi

1241
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,800
um this is kind of a question for a

1242
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,440
comment that both Jess and Louis made so

1243
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,900
you mentioned kind of seeing the gap

1244
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,520
between how financial fraud detection

1245
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,839
Works versus sort of like security

1246
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:14,820
incident in response do you see some

1247
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,619
patterns potentially like going towards

1248
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,119
the security side so for instance things

1249
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,000
like synthetic data sets and using those

1250
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,980
or is this something that people already

1251
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,900
do in industry

1252
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,880
I think it depends a lot on like what

1253
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,859
your fraud team looks like

1254
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:30,720
um but typically from my perspective

1255
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,599
like from what I'm seeing the fraud team

1256
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,700
operates a lot like a sock

1257
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,859
um there's uh there's like levels within

1258
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,180
it like there's Specialists for

1259
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,220
escalation some people who do more of

1260
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,579
the the data the actual data modeling

1261
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:46,859
for fraud and detection rules is backed

1262
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,960
by a data like an actual like team of

1263
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,700
Engineers but then the analysts who are

1264
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,680
actually operating on the work

1265
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,880
um you know they have good knowledge

1266
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,839
about what they're doing but they don't

1267
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:57,119
have that engineering level knowledge so

1268
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,440
that that's what I see the in the

1269
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,300
parallels the most is from what I the

1270
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,339
way I watch this the fraud teams operate

1271
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:04,859
it's a lot more analogous to a sock cert

1272
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:07,980
than it is to like an engineering team

1273
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,359
so that's what like makes me really

1274
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,300
excited but it'd be really hard to push

1275
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,619
that model like that would be a really

1276
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:14,940
challenging one I think that's why I'm

1277
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,800
also like fascinated by looking at the

1278
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,720
fraud space yeah I think for me what

1279
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,280
I've seen is like

1280
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,619
the kyc type of type of motion in both

1281
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,420
spaces is really important and if you

1282
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,640
just have take away that singular piece

1283
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,960
and focus on it both sides can really

1284
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,579
benefit right because when it comes to

1285
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,140
like identity in your applications or

1286
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,000
within your environment if you have a

1287
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,260
really strong signal for that you can

1288
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,460
solve for fraud and you can solve for

1289
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,540
most security issues yeah 100 plus one

1290
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,140
here

1291
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,000
hi so you basically talk about how you

1292
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,280
want to use AI to do a lot of proactive

1293
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,740
security response and I think actually

1294
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,420
that's pretty ingenious coming from an

1295
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,400
SRE background because firefighting

1296
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,280
[ __ ] sucks because that's my language

1297
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,260
um but I wanted to know for the AI side

1298
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,920
are you actually building custom llms or

1299
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,380
are you using like chat gpt's

1300
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,960
professional license as an exposed API

1301
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,819
and then using some of those agents that

1302
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:10,740
they have to build those models and

1303
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,300
those tools so this might be a bit of a

1304
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,520
hot take maybe some folks in the room

1305
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,020
from some of these companies but I'm so

1306
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,460
ready I don't believe we should really

1307
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,160
be leaning too heavily on third-party

1308
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,780
llms it's not actually really

1309
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,460
complicated to have an in-house llm

1310
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,260
that's a lot smaller to serve our

1311
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,819
specific use cases and that's basically

1312
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:28,500
what we're doing right using these

1313
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,780
smaller more fine-tuned models instead

1314
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,579
of relying on sending our you know

1315
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:33,960
really confidential data out to a third

1316
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,240
party wait you mean sending all of your

1317
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,819
logs and customer information to a third

1318
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:41,640
party that doesn't have strong privacy

1319
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,660
or security policies is not a good idea

1320
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,040
oh no

1321
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,839

for both open and closed Source uh

1331
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,880
tooling but when it comes to

1332
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,680
detectionist code how would you like us

1333
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,319
to when it when it comes to say we're

1334
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,180
different customer bases different user

1335
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,339
bases want to make different changes at

1336
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:34,260
the same time how would you like us to

1337
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,380
manage that would you like to say

1338
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,060
maintain a fork and we offer you changes

1339
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,099
and you decide to accept them or not or

1340
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:42,240
have you thought about how that might

1341
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,060
work yes yes

1342
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,040

1343
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,839
it's like yeah let us work but also we

1344
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:50,400
want to benefit from what the community

1345
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,260
and what the company because you all

1346
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,900
have in-house subject matter experts and

1347
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,000
if you don't please get people who do

1348
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,920
security working in your company yeah

1349
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,140

1350
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,900
official stuff we offer you this is what

1351

you might find helpful those are kind of

1353
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:09,180
the three buckets I think of the

1354
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,579
detections falling into

1355
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:14,640
and remember sponsors paid for Visa so

1356
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,560
that's why we didn't trash them directly

1357
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,319
no we said no did I say any names no no

1358
