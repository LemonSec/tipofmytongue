1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,460
hey everyone uh thanks for joining our

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,440
talk uh we're here to talk about what

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,060
does it mean to build a proactive

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,560
security culture

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,540
um in an organization

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,599
um

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,780
well my name is makund I run product

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,180
security at chime uh prior time I was at

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,560
Credit Karma and even proud of that

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,900
other synopsis or Curry

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,820
hi everyone my name is arcadi I'm a

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,199
security architect at chime and

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,560
previously I was at Twitter and Airbnb

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,779
cool

15
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,098
um so what are we planning on covering

16
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,540
today very briefly we're going to talk

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,559
about what do we mean by security

18
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,719
culture and why invested it at all why

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,280
is it important then we're going to talk

20
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,200
about what has and hasn't worked for our

21
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,000
organization and our past organizations

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,100
then a little bit on how you can measure

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,440
security culture and then our concluding

24
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,320
thoughts and questions from you all

25
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,719
right so what do we even mean by

26
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,940
security culture so I think at its core

27
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,520
the culture that you have determines how

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,739
work gets done in your organization so

29
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,360
this is very much rooted in one's

30
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,000
Behavior so uh things like how people

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,580
work how do people communicate what

32
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,860
behaviors are incentivized all of these

33
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,540
are some or some of these are factors

34
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,119
that contribute to what kind of security

35
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,860
culture one could have in an

36
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,439
organization and we thank all of these

37
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,900
are factors at one could consciously uh

38
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,500
choose to invest in we'll talk more

39
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,860
about that

40
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,479
um so why should you invest in culture

41
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,520
why is it important well almost all

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,020
security work at organizations happens

43
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,640
outside of the security team it's going

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,680
to be done by product engineering data

45
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,720
marketing analytics et cetera all of

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,740
these other teams they're the ones who

47
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,759
are really in the day-to-day and

48
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,619
implementing all this work and you're

49
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:42,180
not in their reporting chains you can't

50
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,680
order them to do things you can't tell

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,020
them to you must do this thing so it's

52
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,220
really important that you lead in your

53
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,020
organization through soft power and

54
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,939
through influence and you do that by

55
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,619
having a security culture that's one of

56
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,180
the most scalable ways to enact security

57
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,340
changes in your organization and the

58
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,600
business needs to find Value in your

59
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,439
services

60
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,360
so you should make a conscious effort to

61
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,979
build social capital with people and you

62
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,840
can use that as currency to get your

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,460
changes accomplished

64
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,479
um and it's not always about getting

65
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,439
things done you just need to be

66
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,220
reasonable sometimes

67
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,940
um so uh this is a tweet that really

68
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,220
resonated with us hey if you work for a

69
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,080
security organization in a company and

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,580
your user see you as the enemy maybe you

71
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,900
should rethink what you're doing you

72
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,120
know if if people don't likely don't

73
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,500
like you then you're gonna have a very

74
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,700
hard time accomplishing your goals

75
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,680
cool so other reasons why you would be

76
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,020
investing in security culture I think um

77
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,379
you need your organization's help to get

78
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,879
done through your regular day-to-day

79
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,220
security work most of the time security

80
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,379
teams are tiny compared to the size of

81
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,580
engineering or the rest of the company

82
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,680
so if you look at engineering it's close

83
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,200
to like one is a 150 uh the ratio that

84
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,500
is like for every 150 Engineers you have

85
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,360
maybe one security engineer so there's

86
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,800
absolutely no way you're going to know

87
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,660
what all of these 150 Engineers are

88
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,760
doing uh you got it you've got to build

89
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,680
a culture where they trust enough they

90
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,940
trust you enough so that you can they

91
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,980
can come to you and tell you when for

92
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,900
example they're going and writing a

93
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,420
whole new third-party integration or if

94
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,680
they actually accidentally clicked on

95
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,459
something or they don't download

96
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,800
something that they don't actually know

97
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,140
if it is safe and they they should trust

98
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,659
you to come and tell you that hey

99
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,000
um I did this accidentally

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,040
um similarly like having a collaborative

101
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,500
culture here makes makes it very easy

102
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,360
and not an upward battle for every

103
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,739
single thing you don't have to justify

104
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,959
yourself just because you hey why are

105
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,239
you doing this if you are caught up in

106
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,700
that world then you are never going to

107
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,920
be successful um growing that security

108
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,840
program

109
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,780
cool so what works

110
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,239
uh building relationships and both top

111
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,920
down and bottom up I think both of them

112
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,480
are equally important I'll go over top

113
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,500
down

114
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,840
um so if you have been at situations

115
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,940
where uh you've had a hard time getting

116
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,500
the rest of the company being

117
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,360
accountable for security uh that means

118
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,340
something is wrong so I think start with

119
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,379
the leaders talk to your VPS talk to

120
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:59,640
your senior directors talk to your

121
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,980
directors ask them what is it that they

122
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,840
are worried about security like you've

123
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,459
got to make sure that the question is

124
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,440
turned towards themselves and ask them

125
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,879
like hey reflect on what is it that

126
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,019
you're building and what is it that

127
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,040
could go wrong from a security

128
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
perspective we are here to help you but

129
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,040
we need you to tell us what is that

130
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,420
you're worried about

131
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,160
um similarly as what are the top goals

132
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,500
uh try and convince them like how are

133
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,260
you there to help them uh satisfy those

134
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,860
um

135
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,120
also understand how are they

136
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,759
incentivized by if uh supporting

137
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,199
security or getting security stuff done

138
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,720
is not part of their incentives and

139
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,940
you're never going to be successful

140
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,560
um this is for more advanced companies

141
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,560
or sorry teams if you can go do security

142
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,360
Road shows so

143
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,220
um I found this really helpful um at the

144
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,780
minimum you'll figure out who the most

145
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,919
toxic leaders are in the rest

146
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,240
organization

147
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,560
um why is that important because you'll

148
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,940
know where you're going to get most of

149
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,600
the resistance from

150
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,960
um cool so that was uh building

151
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,759
relationships top down um I also find

152
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,259
building relationships bottom up very

153
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,000
effective meet Engineers where they are

154
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,699
so be very active on code reviews on

155
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,220
design reviews in jira on slack in your

156
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,540
security ass Channel

157
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,740
um everywhere else I find it really

158
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,979
effective to be very vocal very active

159
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,060
and if people can see that you're

160
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,620
putting in all this work and being very

161
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,060
responsive and watching things very

162
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,259
closely they'll understand that it's

163
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,520
important they'll be more likely to work

164
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,660
with you they'll be more likely to

165
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,740
listen to you if you approach them with

166
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,540
some sort of change or ask request or

167
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,000
something like that you know sometimes

168
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,340
um certain teams you might have a pretty

169
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,199
good relationship with the leader of the

170
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,400
team and you can go to them directly but

171
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,539
other times you might have a poor

172
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,919
relationship with the manager but you

173
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,240
might have an excellent relationship

174
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,100
with a an engineer on the team taking

175
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,419
that bottom-up approach and you can just

176
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:34,740
go to them directly and say hey can you

177
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,240
patch this thing really quick and Skip

178
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,039
all the rigmarole of like a Sprint

179
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,840
planning or something like that so it's

180
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,860
really nice to have that kind of

181
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,440
optionality and also for more advanced

182
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,139
teams uh if your team company reaches a

183
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,699
certain size having an embedded security

184
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:48,840
program where you're actually going to

185
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,300
take a security engineer and put them

186
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,220
within some other team also can be very

187
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,660
effective again requires a certain level

188
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,660
of maturity to get to that point

189
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,240
cool uh what else works so having a

190
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,800
challenge Network definitely helps so

191
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,900
this is a group of people that you trust

192
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,880
that can give you a good candid direct

193
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,199
feedback

194
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,460
um realize that they are going to be

195
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,199
your biggest critics but it's fine like

196
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,000
in have them and whenever you're

197
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
building a new security product or a

198
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,139
security feature or process and ask them

199
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,000
for feedback like tell them hey how do

200
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
you how how does this look for you like

201
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,539
does this make sense

202
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:24,000
um I think they are people that you can

203
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,800
rely on and I think having that

204
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,180
challenge Network in every company of

205
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,220
where I've been in has really helped uh

206
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,960
me uh growing that security culture

207
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,940
similarly I think uh one other thing

208
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,139
that a lot of

209
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,600
um teams get on into the world is trying

210
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,280
to make everyone happy uh just realize

211
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,020
that's never going to happen and

212
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,660
um actually it kind of degrades your

213
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,919
security culture if you get to that

214
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,880
level

215
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,680
um so I'm so it's perfectly fine to make

216
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,080
sure that to realize that not everyone

217
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,758
is going to be happy with what you do

218
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,840
um another tool that has worked very

219
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,919
effectively for us is just being

220
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,419
completely transparent with engineering

221
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,400
with the rest of the company share

222
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,199
metrics share bug Bounty reports sure

223
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,960
pen test reports of oh is it not Audible

224
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,180
okay I'm just going to use this for now

225
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,180
um so uh yeah share metric sure bug

226
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,800
Bounty report sure pen test reports um

227
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,180
I've actually worked in security teams

228
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,819
before where maybe uh they're worried

229
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,500
about like having their vulnerabilities

230
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,900
be open in jira maybe somebody sees the

231
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,340
vulnerability and then they exploit it

232
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,740
somehow I'm not saying that's not uh an

233
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,240
impossible risk but I think that the

234
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,639
benefits of sharing and being open with

235
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,160
your program far outweigh any sort of

236
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,560
risk from someone like exploiting an

237
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,900
issue that they find in jira so leave

238
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,460
all your issues open run blameless

239
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,139
Retros um admit when you're wrong show

240
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,699
vulnerability not just the security kind

241
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,500
you know sometimes you misjudge the

242
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,479
impact of vulnerability if that happens

243
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,520
just say to the team

244
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,220
my bad don't try and like uh force the

245
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,720
issue and then later if you're

246
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,680
approaching them about something else

247
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,759
they'll know you're coming from a place

248
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,319
of good faith

249
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,120
um share updates and be visible so that

250
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,979
means presenting at company all hands

251
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,479
and giving talks sending out a

252
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,520
newsletter sending out presentations

253
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,960
um doing engineering Brown Bags very

254
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,819
common companies um one thing that I

255
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,080
find really effective is bug Bounty

256
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,580
walkthroughs I think a lot of Engineers

257
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,860
actually really are very curious about

258
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,960
security how does it work how do I get

259
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,580
into it but they don't know or they

260
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,840
don't have the resources available to

261
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,460
them so if you just send out a blurb

262
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,020
here's a vulnerability that we had

263
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,639
here's what the impact was here's how

264
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,020
you exploit it here's like a curl

265
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,120
command that you can run Engineers will

266
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,800
really enjoy that kind of content and

267
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,820
then they'll be much more willing to

268
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,919
work with you and again more of an

269
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,940
advanced item but if your company

270
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,500
reaches a level where you can run

271
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,260
security awareness events um that's also

272
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,000
very effective it requires a lot of work

273
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,399
cool I think making it easy to do the

274
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,080
right thing is also really really

275
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,959
effective a lot of companies are uh

276
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,600
using the Netflix paid path approach

277
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,839
um I think it's proven to be effective

278
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,000
um like make sure that security controls

279
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,459
are baked into the uh Frameworks or

280
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,839
libraries that your rest of the

281
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,640
engineering is using and when that's not

282
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,459
possible make it easy for uh people to

283
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,440
be notified that hey something is going

284
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,500
wrong like here's how you fix it simply

285
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,720
um similarly I think documentation and

286
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,580
education that do not suck or as

287
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,140
directly to the point is really really

288
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,459
effective

289
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,560
um and I think instead of Toronto teach

290
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,000
them the entire history of a

291
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,320
vulnerability and everything just get to

292
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,399
the point and like make it very

293
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
effective and that really works

294
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,800
um and gamification uh is also huge uh

295
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,200
at time where we are uh if you have

296
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,240
missed the previous talk on Monaco it's

297
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,920
basically a tool that we've built inside

298
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,740
that basically gamify security for the

299
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,420
rest of uh services that are all the

300
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,959
rest of the things that are Building

301
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,760
Services so we have say hundreds of

302
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,380
services uh we want all these services

303
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,779
to do X Y and Z instead of going and

304
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,399
reaching out to all of these services to

305
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,740
say hey go to XYZ we gamified by give

306
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,660
them a security score uh and that's been

307
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,339
really effective

308
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:57,720
um the other thing that has really uh

309
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,040
worked for us is meeting developers

310
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,500
where they are like if you onboard a

311
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,180
dozen vendors or you are integrating

312
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,100
with a dozen tools you can't expect a

313
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,720
developers to go log into all of those

314
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,100
tools and look at all the findings like

315
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,019
uh simplified for them meet them where

316
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,300
they are use graph that's what the

317
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,100
developers are using use GitHub Advanced

318
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,180
secure dashboard if that's what people

319
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,040
are doing like make it available to them

320
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,779
where they are instead of expecting them

321
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,720
to log into all your security tools

322
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,040
um similarly I think how many of you

323
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,740
here have a policy that says uh you

324
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,200
shall or you must rotate your secrets

325
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,120
every 90 days

326
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,800
right quite a few of you have that I

327
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,000
don't know if you make it easy for

328
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,740
developers to do that like how do you

329
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,480
hormone help themselves service tools

330
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,880
that they can go do with themselves

331
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,860
right so almost no one so I think that's

332
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,180
kind of the point of Tomorrow makers

333
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,620
like make it easier for developers to do

334
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,820
the right thing and they will more

335
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,200
likely go into that right thing

336
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,480
um another uh way that we find it

337
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,620
effective to build security culture

338
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,019
within an organization be pragmatic um

339
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,959
don't practice security absolutism be

340
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,399
realistic about risk you're never going

341
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,480
to solve all risk there's always going

342
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,220
to be some residual risk remaining don't

343
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,959
let perfect be the enemy of good you

344
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,640
know you can resolve some risks really

345
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,220
really effectively uh don't uh practice

346
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,380
security absolutism

347
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,000
um don't be a security Nazi if somebody

348
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,140
comes to you and asks you a question

349
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,640
maybe even if the answer is no like

350
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,899
sometimes you have to say no but don't

351
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,940
be mean about it be empathetic trying to

352
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,959
understand their needs and help them

353
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,820
accomplish their goals

354
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,140
um have a security engineering

355
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,000
onboarding or just regular security

356
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
onboarding for your whole company that

357
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,019
doesn't suck and be relevant so you know

358
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,399
I've seen security presentations in the

359
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,380
past or and I'll touch on this in some

360
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,760
later slides but they'll say things like

361
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,459
don't click on suspicious links which is

362
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,440
like I've been doing this for a while I

363
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,480
don't know what a suspicious link is

364
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,820
um don't uh don't connect to untrusted

365
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,019
networks like I don't think that's

366
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,640
really relevant anymore

367
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,860
um make a don't don't practice like

368
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,360
performative exercises right make it

369
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,740
relevant for people show people some

370
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,300
real world impacts show people some real

371
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,680
world like how are companies getting

372
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,880
hacked

373
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,040
um and then and then you know people

374
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,260
will listen to you um they'll be more

375
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,640
likely to take your advice or work with

376
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,500
you and this is just a funny comic that

377
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,959
I enjoyed from poorly giant poorly Drawn

378
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,220
Lines

379
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,360
um you have to choose your battles I

380
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,620
choose all of them like be like the rat

381
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,040
don't be like the The Raven

382
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,660
cool

383
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,300
um also yeah you rely more more and more

384
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,160
on your other engineering or other

385
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,260
domains of your company to do the work

386
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,660
like give them credit give them Kudos

387
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,519
give them shout outs send them cupcakes

388
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,920
it's perfectly fine people love cookies

389
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,260
um I'll take more if you have some uh

390
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,360
but I think uh in general I think uh

391
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,519
people tend to really focus more on like

392
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,839
telling their team like hey you're doing

393
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,399
a good job for going and doing all these

394
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,480
things I think it's also important to

395
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,720
tell uh your vendors or your

396
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,060
um your other supporting functions in

397
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,380
the company that hey when they're

398
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,180
actually doing things like tell them

399
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,260
thank you

400
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,760
um also realize that not everyone is

401
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,339
incentivized the same way so see what it

402
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,620
is that the teams really and values like

403
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,440
someone someone just value more bonus or

404
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,519
someone might just be happy with the

405
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,839
cupcake it doesn't matter like just find

406
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,820
out what they are and uh reach out to

407
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,740
them with us

408
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,480
so only I think it's also okay to ask

409
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,700
for help a lot of security teams get

410
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,620
into this world of oh and the engineer I

411
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,940
need to go solve all the problems like

412
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,800
no I don't think you know the domain as

413
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,200
well as your domain teams too so reach

414
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,160
out to them tell them what the problem

415
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,720
you're trying to solve for

416
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,880
um how is it you're gonna um how is it

417
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,260
they can help you solving that

418
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,940
particular problem and

419
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,560
um actually it actually works uh

420
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,920
wonderful

421
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,720
uh cool so that was some things that

422
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,680
have worked well for us now we're going

423
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,880
to go over some things that have worked

424
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,899
not well that have made the security

425
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:32,820
culture worse in our organizations

426
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,019
um so to start things off I'm just going

427
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,160
to give you a second to read this tweet

428
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,760
that I enjoyed

429
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
um I think it's a really funny tweet but

430
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,700
the reason that I included it is because

431
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,260
I again have seen this in so many

432
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,700
organizations where people don't trust

433
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,839
their own employees they don't trust

434
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,420
Engineers they keep everything very

435
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,860
close to the chest and you know you can

436
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,180
imagine if you go to some engineer and

437
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,279
say hey I need you to do this thing it's

438
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,480
really important I need you to drop

439
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,680
everything and do it right now I'm not

440
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,760
going to tell you why I'm asking you to

441
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,899
do it like that's never going to land

442
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,639
well but I've seen people do that it's

443
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,220
nuts so it's kind of just the opposite

444
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,959
of the transparency slide you really

445
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,700
really want to be overly transparent

446
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,180
with your team

447
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,240
hard deadlines and ultimatum Zone work

448
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,680
don't try this

449
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
um there's always going to be scenarios

450
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,980
where your policy doesn't work or your

451
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,320
policy is not applicable so try and

452
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,940
reason with the engineering team or

453
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,079
whichever domain team you're working

454
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,160
with

455
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,560
um for more more more often than not we

456
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,180
have seen that people will try and help

457
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,740
you do the right thing it's just that if

458
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,540
someone is going out of the way to not

459
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,920
do something it's maybe it's because

460
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,540
whatever you're asking them to do is not

461
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,339
applicable for their domain

462
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,880
um so yeah

463
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,779
um another thing that doesn't work too

464
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,459
well is being disconnected from reality

465
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,199
or losing credibility with engineering

466
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,820
so examples of that if you're going to

467
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,199
run some sort of off-the-shelf scanner

468
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:47,699
and just like open up hundreds of jira

469
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,800
tickets against the team and ask them to

470
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,060
validate the findings that's going to be

471
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,320
really hard right a lot of those are

472
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,940
probably going to be false positives or

473
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,579
unreachable code or low severity or

474
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,199
maybe it's a real valid issue and

475
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,579
there's no patch available and the team

476
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,680
just can't do anything about it so put

477
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,000
in that work up front to validate the

478
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,199
findings bring them the relevant things

479
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:05,459
that they need to actually action and

480
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,779
don't give them a lot of like busy work

481
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,820
that they don't want to do and don't be

482
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,139
removed from like how engineering writes

483
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,459
into place code you know don't just like

484
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:12,720
throw things over the fence and say like

485
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,399
hey we need this thing done go do this

486
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,079
thing without understanding the

487
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,699
complexity or the size of the ask that

488
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,440
you're giving them that's not going to

489
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,720
be very effective

490
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,639
oh and here's another tweet that we

491
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,779
enjoyed so this is Dino ahead of

492
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,279
security a cash app

493
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,420
um you know if engineering doesn't like

494
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,740
working with you you aren't going to

495
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,000
have a secure environment no matter what

496
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,620
else you do I think that's a very true

497
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,399
cool

498
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,839
um security teams that are disengaged

499
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,040
from the rest of the process in the same

500
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,060
line I think

501
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,399
um if if folks are interested in doing

502
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,480
the right thing and they reach out to

503
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,040
you and be like hey I'm going to do this

504
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,959
third party integration or I'm going to

505
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,019
have this whole new uh data source

506
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,760
exported how do I do it right and you're

507
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,079
not engaged and you're not telling them

508
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,880
what is it how do they do it right and

509
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,459
just being disengaged never works so I

510
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:57,839
think the quality of your security

511
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,360
program or how well you do from a

512
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,279
security perspective is directly related

513
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,139
to how engaged you are with the rest of

514
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,860
the program

515
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,300
um this is another thing that really is

516
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,620
a pet peeve of mine giving useless

517
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,060
advice so I mentioned some of these

518
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,380
already don't click suspicious links

519
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,000
what's a suspicious link I have no idea

520
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,620
don't connect to untrusted networks I

521
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,000
think this is really outdated advice

522
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,500
everything runs over TLS now it's just

523
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,660
not a real issue this uh FBI Denver

524
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,100
tweet I think went viral in the security

525
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,019
company Community

526
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,639
um a few weeks ago they posted this

527
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,079
tweet saying like watch out for juice

528
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,300
jacking attacks in airports which is not

529
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,560
a thing that anyone needs to worry about

530
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,060
I don't know why they decided to tweet

531
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,079
about this but then they got a lot of

532
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,160
flack for it

533
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,360
um so give people like actionable

534
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,639
relevant advice that uh you know is up

535
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,959
to date that's not this like outdated

536
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,820
like performative like check the box

537
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,980
kind of control don't give generic

538
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,000
advice you should be specific and

539
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,220
actionable an example of this I've seen

540
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,759
um

541
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,800
examples in the past where someone you

542
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,180
know you give someone some advice like

543
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,940
oh you're accepting file uploads like

544
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,380
um scan that from malware and then

545
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,759
that's it that's the like one bullet

546
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,779
point of feedback skin items from

547
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:58,800
malware it's like how's the team

548
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,880
supposed to do that are they going to

549
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,199
use a vendor are they going to onboard a

550
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,339
whole vendor to do this thing are they

551
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,360
going to deploy some off-the-shelf

552
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,339
solution like how do they actually do

553
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:07,199
that um like you give give people advice

554
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,900
that they can actually follow

555
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,179
cool now that we've spoken about what

556
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,040
security culture is what works and what

557
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,839
doesn't work there are some things that

558
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,660
we use to measure security culture um

559
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,699
it's just like any other uh

560
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,079
vulnerability that you have and you

561
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,400
measure the age of it you can also

562
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,599
measure security culture some things

563
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,220
that work for us it doesn't have to be

564
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,359
too fancy it could be just be things

565
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,520
that you have in your spreadsheet

566
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,980
um but uh I start off with who do I meet

567
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,360
with how many engineering teams are

568
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,220
there in my organization uh do I meet

569
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,539
with all of them how are they doing from

570
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,160
a security perspective if I do meet with

571
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,080
them or don't meet with them are they

572
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,460
remediating more issues just because I

573
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,720
meet with them

574
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,840
um are there uh involving Security in

575
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,980
more of their initiatives if we meet

576
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,120
with them

577
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,220
um things like

578
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,799
um monocle really helps us because again

579
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,799
we're trying to track their score uh

580
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:58,080
based on the gamification over here uh

581
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,880
to see how how does a team perform over

582
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,320
time like are they improving in their

583
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,020
security posture or decreasing

584
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,799
um

585
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,500
things like how quickly do teams uh

586
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,360
adopt to security controls or Frameworks

587
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,039
that we have been introducing

588
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,240
um again what's the correlation directly

589
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,520
with like do you have a relationship

590
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,620
with that team or not or are they uh

591
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,299
looking at their monocle scores or like

592
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,919
their security scores or anything in

593
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,360
that sense

594
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,559
um what's their interaction with

595
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,880
security I think one thing we have seen

596
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,500
over time is

597
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,240
um teams have started including security

598
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,039
a support point in their Sprint planning

599
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,720
which shows that we are doing some

600
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,799
things right

601
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,120
um so they go look at hey let's go check

602
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,640
out monocle and see okay how did uh do

603
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,200
we have any action items uh for this

604
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,280
Sprint and things in that sense

605
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,660
uh cool so that's pretty much the slides

606
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,039
that we had just very briefly in a

607
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:44,940
conclusion

608
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,840
um you should definitely invest in

609
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,460
security culture it pays dividends it's

610
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,720
going to be the way that you scale your

611
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,860
security program and make changes

612
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,500
especially across a larger organization

613
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,480
the larger that your organization is the

614
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,340
harder it is to change culture so start

615
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,799
early and that'll really pay off and

616
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,000
there's no Silver Bullet you're gonna

617
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,500
have to you know try out whatever works

618
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,559
and doesn't work in your organization

619
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,020
cool uh we're hiring we're hiring for a

620
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,260
data security expert so if it's

621
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,400
something that you're interested in

622
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,260
you're helping you're ready to come help

623
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,380
us secure all our data pipelines and

624
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,880
everything in the world of data uh to

625
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,100
reach out to us

626
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,740
we will open it up for questions

627
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,340
yes

628
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,620
what advice can you give on that do you

629
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,320
feel like the CEO itself is somebody who

630
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,360
has

631
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,360
to beardy and and does he help that talk

632
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,940
about that coach and then to how did

633
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,520
Netflix get to where they are because

634
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,960
they seem to be the outlier

635
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,580
Within

636
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,440
yeah do you want to repeat the question

637
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,299
oh sure

638
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,700
um given that Netflix culture is

639
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,580
different from many others and um I

640
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,440
think if I'm paraphrasing the question

641
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,320
correctly um it's to say that how does

642
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,760
it work for organizations that don't

643
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,100
really have a top culture uh

644
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,679
is this

645
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,860
um and uh What uh mechanisms can a

646
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,380
culture a company with that culture do

647
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,600
um I think I think it's more prevalent

648
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,880
for companies where there is a kind of a

649
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,620
top-down approach instead of I think for

650
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,480
Netflix you might not run into that

651
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,820
accountability problem that often

652
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,860
um one thing I've really uh realized

653
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,039
that for uh situations where

654
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:46,260
um the company thinks okay just because

655
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,120
we've hired a security team it's their

656
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,860
responsibility go fix all the issues

657
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,559
that's where more of the top-down uh

658
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,080
culture really is more applicable or

659
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,940
effective is that you get them to be

660
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,220
more accountable to say that we're just

661
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,900
here to help your function deliver

662
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,780
things more securely less about we are

663
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,480
going to be responsible for securing all

664
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,820
of your product does it make sense

665
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,640
yes

666
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,600
help enforce

667
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,280
all right I'll repeat the question the

668
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,340
question is uh how is our CSO reporting

669
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,919
back to the CEO or is everyone that

670
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,900
connection yes there is

671
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,260
um there is a way of uh reporting risks

672
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,419
back all the way back to the uh

673
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,460
leadership and also the board

674
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,679
um just like most of the companies I

675
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,080
imagine and um yes I see so like we

676
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,299
report back to all the different domain

677
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,340
VPS but also we also report back to the

678
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,039
CTO and the Cs uh the CEO if needed

679
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,260
depending on what the level of the risk

680
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,780
is like is a risk that someone is not

681
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,360
patching or fixing or implementing I'm

682
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,640
going to open up a risk that's going to

683
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,919
affect the entire company or what's the

684
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:06,780
likelihood and impact of it depending on

685
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,320
that way to report

686
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,159
um if I could just add some concrete

687
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,100
examples so we have an audit committee

688
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,840
to the board that our CSO presents at

689
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,000
quarterly we have a monthly engineering

690
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,980
review where we're presenting metrics

691
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,220
and that's being seen by leaders we have

692
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,280
um our our boss the CSO he's managing

693
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,020
upwards that's his job to try and like

694
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,220
present those findings and make sure

695
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,260
that the peers and like leadership are

696
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,400
seeing the things that we think are

697
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,840
scary and making sure that those are

698
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,580
being actioned on

699
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,200
um are there any other examples

700
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,940
today there we go

701
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,799
we also have an

702
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,659
we also have like a monthly engineering

703
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:44,220
review that's more for engineering but

704
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,620
all the engineering VPS directors all of

705
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,299
them get a sense of that but that's more

706
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,159
on the engineering side yeah

707
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,860
uh sorry David yeah

708
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,918
yeah

709
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,400
let's stay with

710
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,700
you so the question was how do you scale

711
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,039
uh dependency vulnerability management

712
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,059
when there's maybe thousands of low

713
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,380
severity findings and how do we make

714
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,760
sure that we're not spanning spamming

715
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,880
teams so we keep plugging David's talk

716
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,620
from earlier today he wrote a tool

717
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,059
called monocle and it's ingesting all of

718
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:37,559
our GitHub data and presenting a

719
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,780
dashboard to developers every repo gets

720
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,220
a letter grade for how secure it is like

721
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,600
you have an A plus score for security or

722
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,860
you have an F score for security there's

723
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,840
like a a badge that they put on their

724
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,700
readme so that'll ingest findings from

725
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,400
GitHub and we just kind of take github's

726
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,840
word for what the severity of the

727
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,580
findings is like they'll triage those

728
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,140
and you know they bought dependabot and

729
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,940
some other things to do that so that's

730
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,860
one way we make sure that depend about

731
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,900
Auto merge PRS are enabled on all of our

732
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,220
repos and then it's like solved for

733
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,299
developers they don't even have to do

734
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:04,559
anything

735
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,480
um what are some other ways a lot of

736
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,220
times there's a very high profile like

737
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,960
uh I don't know like log4j or something

738
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,700
for example where like when one of those

739
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,200
happens then we're going to do a very

740
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,299
high touch like actually actively find

741
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,620
stuff ourselves and reach out to teams

742
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,700
to make sure it's all patched but for

743
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,900
the most part we just try and make sure

744
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,820
people are applying all of their updates

745
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,620
in a reasonable amount of time

746
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,600
and I think that's our time but we are

747
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,520
going to be outside if anyone has more

748
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,700
questions

749
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,249
[Applause]
