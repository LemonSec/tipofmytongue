1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,860
all right wonderful thank you for coming

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,440
out for another Village's talk we have

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,319
Sasha today a director of engineering at

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,300
grammarly so I'll let him take it away

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,219
that way we can Jump Right In

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,320
quick Round of Applause thank you

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,199
all right this is working

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,460
uh thanks for uh the code red folks and

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,340
B-side also to starting this event

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,439
um when I was approached to do this

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,080
presentation I I honestly didn't quite

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,899
know what to present on uh am I going to

13
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,840
go super technical or or not and as I

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,579
started reflecting and especially

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,879
grammarly uh is in a hiring boom I'm

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,800
doing a lot of interviews I was like why

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,840
don't I share like common mistakes

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,320
people are doing in my opinion uh some

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,180
of the people do very well and suddenly

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,820
hit a wall so this presentation is

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,020
really

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,059
about it's not about like the technical

23
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:59,399
skills it's it's really around how do

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,440
you prepare how do you actually prepare

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,879
for the interview how do you structure

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,500
your answer

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,080
um passing an interview is a skill I

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,260
have met I have said no to people I

29
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,080
legitimately think are very talented

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,540
but they could not deliver on the

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,799
interview it didn't surface on the

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,140
interview either they were too humble or

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,460
they were in a country or that a little

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,820
bit kind of a dick or not the nicest

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,580
people uh so it's like really about how

36
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,159
to how to improve that

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,220
um this presentation and I just as a

38
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,420
quick thing

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,460
it's not for people just looking for a

40
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,380
job this is for people looking at their

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,600
career I think most of you are looking

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,460
at a career you're not just looking for

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,159
a quick job uh it applies for people

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,140
looking for a quick job but it's mostly

45
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,939
apply for a career and Landing those

46
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,180
roles that that are so important

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,040
as I mentioned the main thing is about

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,340
planning you have to organize you have

49
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,399
to understand who the company is you

50
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,140
have to understand what the role is as

51
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,899
well so planning is everything there's

52
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,820
some couple of Tricks out there I think

53
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,119
the Storm at the uh in terms of

54
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,800
answering questions and structure in

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,840
question uh works very well I see people

56
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,560
use it uh what is the situation uh what

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,780
are the tasks that you've done what are

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,959
the actions and don't forget the results

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,700
right so I see a lot of people say oh

60
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,459
yeah we did this and that how did how

61
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:27,840
was that measured what was the impact

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,360
and so on they come in empty-handed or

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,860
they didn't structure enough where they

64
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,420
run out of time to actually go highlight

65
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,800
that

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,020
so the star method works out pretty well

67
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,020
and come up with some you know there are

68
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,519
certain things that you cannot predict

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,680
in terms of which coding questions are

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,019
you're going to be asked and so on but

71
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,280
there's certain things that you can

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,580
control or anticipate for example start

73
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,040
writing quesadies around what project

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,900
you're you've been the most proud of in

75
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,340
your career

76
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,440
that is actually a case study you can

77
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,760
really sit down and think through about

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,340
that uh what project you delivered that

79
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,220
had the high end highest impact that may

80
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,840
not be the project you're the most proud

81
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,640
of one of the projects I'm the most

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,620
proud of has been a con a consistent

83
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,080
failure I'm still trying to hit it right

84
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,659
but I keep trying it the project I've

85
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,099
had the most impacts are completely

86
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,120
different

87
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,019
what is the project you bombed

88
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,599
what project did you make critical

89
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,920
mistakes

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,340
what project that was a complete failure

91
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,040
or delayed and so on work on those case

92
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,860
studies all the interviews at larger

93
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,360
company more established company and

94
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,980
even the smaller ones are going to ask

95
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,440
questions around that right

96
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,799
high impact most proud of the one you

97
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,620
failed right let's talk about that

98
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,480
knowing the employer as well is

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,060
extremely important right a lot of the

100
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,500
employees out there are actually sharing

101
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,900
their core values that is an indicator

102
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,440
to you and to everyone who they are what

103
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,480
they focus on right so I'll give you a

104
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,180
few examples of a past employment for me

105
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,840
lift right lift is be yourself uplift

106
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,940
others and make it happen

107
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,280
when you walk through your case studies

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,700
connect the dots there when did I

109
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,978
actually be yourself it's one of my

110
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,779
favorite one we hired you for a reason

111
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,418
we want you to speak up don't hide in a

112
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,840
corner right you're there for a reason

113
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,240
uplift others how do you bring on and

114
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,280
help somebody failing one of my

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,320
interview questions at Lyft is what do

116
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,840
you do when you see a team about to fail

117
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,880
what do you do when you think a team is

118
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,919
failing and they don't realize it

119
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,540
right there's a depth to God's question

120
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,639
by the way these were questions on on

121
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,740
the individual contributor

122
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,540
uh interview not even a manager

123
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,800
interview

124
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,479
right

125
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,300
um make it happen get it done what did

126
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,180
you do to make it happen keep pushing it

127
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,080
I see two season lifters out here uh I

128
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,660
we went through this right

129
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,460
um another one a company which is

130
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,380
notorious for their many leadership

131
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,919
principles Amazon right they break down

132
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,680
for you ahead of time exactly how to

133
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,600
structure your interviews

134
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,580
by the way a good question to ask your

135
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,340
Amazon recruiter what are the top two or

136
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,860
three leadership principle the team you

137
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,199
interview with are focusing on

138
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,479
I cannot and actually I told the

139
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,940
recruiter at the time listen you got 14

140
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,520
leadership principle I'm a busy guy I

141
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,620
want to prepare but I like which one

142
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,080
should I focus on right so the

143
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,060
organization I was I was interviewing

144
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,280
for they mentioned to me

145
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,139
bias for action

146
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,740
right invent and simplify this is like

147
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,780
heavy engineering where we're rebuilding

148
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,360
the payment infrastructure from scratch

149
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,400
right from on premise to actually filed

150
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,380
invent and simplify was the one of the

151
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,960
the key one and ownership nothing is

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,000
beneath you when did you actually show

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
up and and show through ownership of

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,940
helping others moving things along

155
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,860
um if something needs to be picked up on

156
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,300
the floor like you go do it that's

157
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,280
really ownership right so you can ask

158
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,160
these questions and then and then uh

159
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,720
grammarly

160
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,320
um

161
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,940
we are coming up with leadership

162
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,680
principle right now we only share our

163
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,460
core value is the eager value right when

164
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,259
was like in your case study about

165
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:24,720
project the most proud of or failure or

166
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,460
what is the coolest bug you've ever

167
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,560
found this is a common question I keep

168
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,660
asking how do you connect the dots

169
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,160
around being ethical

170
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,380
right being honorable earned trust

171
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,539
adaptable how are you learning through

172
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:40,319
failures uh greedy show perseverance and

173
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,860
long-term goals uh empathetic uh very

174
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,319
similar to uplift others that live how

175
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,000
do you actually help other people when

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,220
you when you see them fail or when you

177
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,780
think they need help they don't need to

178
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,520
ask you actually proactively go do that

179
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,160
and be remarkable when nobody is looking

180
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,780
you actually do the right thing or

181
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,660
you're learning or you're humble so the

182
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,100
companies that are sharing those core

183
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,220
values gives you sort of a here's how we

184
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,060
think

185
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,180
build your case study take notes

186
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,300
uh when I did my interview I remember at

187
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,100
Amazon which was my last interview in

188
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,080
person right before covid

189
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,539
uh I came with a stack of notes

190
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,800
there's not cheat sheet I just showed up

191
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,560
prepared so for each of the interviews

192
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,800
when I started getting inset when I

193
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,900
started getting hint that um

194
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,240
they were probing in certain leadership

195
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,460
principle I had it all mapped out

196
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,759
ownership bias for Action invent and

197
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,300
simplify and I had my notes and

198
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,400
nobody said anything about it I'm not

199
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,199
cheating I just came prepared I came

200
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,180
ready to go right that was a hard

201
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,500
interview

202
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,660
um grammarly very similar is like oh

203
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,699
okay

204
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,919
where was I empathetic where was I not

205
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,660
empathetic and what did I learn from it

206
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,539
right so prepare for that now how does

207
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:01,860
that all make sense in terms of security

208
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,960
when you build your case study

209
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,940
you can actually use and I personally

210
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:10,259
use this uh the CSF framework right so

211
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,880
when you build your case study you're

212
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,620
showing the core values you're showing

213
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,300
your project most productive and so on

214
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,460
now connect the dots

215
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,220
right security is for example a common

216
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,340
thing I see is

217
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,220
uh what was the the coolest bug event or

218
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,340
what bug where you're the most proud of

219
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,440
and then people are describing oh I

220
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,059
found this bug it was really cool I

221
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,799
filed a ticket and moved on

222
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,799
did you actually cover that whole chain

223
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,839
right are you actually connecting the

224
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,599
dots you may actually get away with that

225
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,240
in a pure vulnerability researcher but

226
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,160
that's early in your career

227
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,800
right even the most senior vulnerability

228
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,600
searches I've met actually connected

229
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,060
dots across across all of them

230
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,940
right so go deeper there actually uh

231
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,100
really think through about identify

232
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,899
protect the tech and response and

233
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:01,980
recover

234
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,860
where did you start in that model where

235
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,040
did you carry over where did you learn

236
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,019
for example I learned a tremendous

237
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,240
amount around

238
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,760
detection I developed a tremendous

239
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,860
amount of empathy on response and

240
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,880
recover

241
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,339
right I spent some time with those folks

242
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,920
start learning so when I build my case

243
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,540
study now I really kind of structure

244
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,160
that that way it's like I started here

245
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,680
here's where I passed the torch or

246
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,359
here's where I carry over forward

247
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,500
and don't forget impact what was the

248
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,700
impact

249
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,740
what did you do

250
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,940
I kid you not I meet many many people

251
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,160
I always ask the same question so if you

252
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,540
ever interview with me I'm giving you

253
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,860
some freebies

254
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,260
right what bug you're the most proud of

255
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,019
why and I stay back and I stay silent

256
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,240
and I let the candidate dive into it

257
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,980
right

258
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,380
um how much time did you spend right so

259
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,360
I've seen candidates for example oh yeah

260
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,160
I spent several months blah blah blah

261
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,080
blah and then what happened oh I filed

262
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,940
the ticket

263
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,700
okay let me step back depending on how

264
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,380
senior they are I may ask a following

265
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,939
question was that good use of time

266
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,200
you spend a tremendous amount of time

267
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,180
finding this vulnerability

268
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,040
why did you spend time there did

269
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,200
somebody ask you was that your own gut

270
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,240
feeling curiosity

271
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,399
and you found this thing and then you

272
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,279
just walked away was it fixed

273
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:34,620
right is there mitigating factors in it

274
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,779
I threw that question back to someone

275
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,820
who's like was that town do you think

276
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,899
that was time well spent

277
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,339
not really right so kind of structure it

278
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,220
and impact around the star method which

279
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,560
I highly recommend is it's very easy to

280
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,200
use what was the situation situation is

281
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,380
we had this new hardware or we had a new

282
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,940
partner coming in or we're trying to do

283
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,800
a new integration that's your situation

284
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,000
right

285
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
your task what are the tasks well the

286
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,459
task is we need to go evaluate blah blah

287
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,959
blah look at the vulnerabilities for

288
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,240
this and so on basically do thread

289
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,680
models what are the action that'd be

290
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,120
taking the action is I met with the

291
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,160
engineering team I've discussed with

292
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,079
them I looked at the Timeline I looked

293
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,420
at what are the rest the risk rating for

294
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,700
that oh there was no risk rating what

295
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,680
was the mental motto I came up

296
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
to help clarify and guide right so you

297
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,720
can use a star approach in security

298
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
interview plus uh I'm so used to surface

299
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,260
wise just click and then you connect it

300
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,120
back there

301
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,399
start showing impact momentum and so on

302
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,339
so that's extremely important and I'm so

303
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,740
frustrated I meet candidate who I know

304
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,720
for some of them I know four or five

305
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,120
because I've worked with them before and

306
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,800
they fail to go deliver that impact

307
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,140
right they fail to really kind of

308
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,959
document that it is just a preparation I

309
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,279
know they've done it

310
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,980
I I had a really solid candidate who

311
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,680
I've worked for years recently

312
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,880
completely bombing an interview that he

313
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,200
should have passed his eyes closed

314
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,620
I

315
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,339
I know he can deliver and he failed and

316
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,260
I was so upset because I was like did

317
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,579
you plan

318
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,160
oh we planned I got nervous I forgot the

319
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,480
plan

320
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,940
right so sure question

321
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,760
questions

322
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,680
well

323
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,660
I think in this case I know him

324
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,399
hopefully here

325
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,139
question was uh oh wow it's loud uh

326
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,060
if you knew this guy could execute you

327
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,519
knew he could do the job well but he did

328
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,040
poorly on the interview isn't it

329
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,279
partially the interviewees or the

330
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,620
interviewer's fault like of not asking

331
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,360
the right questions or showcasing his

332
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,800
abilities because you already knew the

333
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,079
guy could do it right why would you fail

334
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,459
him on this interview if you already

335
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,200
knew he could do it why did you make him

336
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,639
jump through these hoops you already

337
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,019
knew that he could do the job

338
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,279
okay uh good

339
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,899
it's a good question I could overrule

340
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,339
everyone and say screw this I know

341
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,380
better I know this person I hire them

342
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,600
right but you're not you're not focusing

343
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,060
on bringing the person in the culture in

344
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,399
there also in this particular case I

345
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,959
exclude myself in the interview process

346
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,459
I know too much

347
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,860
they need to come in and fit in with the

348
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,260
culture right it's not because you know

349
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,079
someone exceed in certain areas it's

350
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,940
about actually gelling with the culture

351
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,480
right any company and I won't name names

352
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,459
but I'm I know some companies do that

353
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,399
right where they they make offer with no

354
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,980
interviews more at the highest senior

355
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,240
level

356
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,060
that is the biggest red flag for me you

357
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,339
have no idea who's in there

358
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,680
you got one toxic person two toxic

359
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,220
person four toxic person ten a hundred

360
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,500
right it's a company that's somewhere

361
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,560
over there right so I got I got five

362
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,959
minutes uh five minutes it's in this Bay

363
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,480
Area a long tenure living on government

364
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,060
contract for a long time but anyways

365
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,940
um so it's not because I I know but they

366
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,620
again the skill of the interview is

367
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,079
important right am I frustrating that

368
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:44,339
they didn't deliver because I would like

369
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:46,680
to work with him again absolutely but

370
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,779
the company has core values and and

371
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:50,940
that's what we're focusing on

372
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,220
uh going back to I'll take question at

373
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,160
the end okay uh going back to impact so

374
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,279
don't forget that also

375
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,440
security is measurable so around impact

376
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,519
extra point if you bring metrics I there

377
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,399
was a metrics I brought it from X to Y

378
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,560
there was no metrics I created the

379
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,959
metrics awareness is the beginning of

380
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,940
change immediately after the metric was

381
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,980
created boom we started making process

382
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,320
so really think through about metrics

383
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,079
vulnerability management metrics when

384
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,699
it's time to discover what is time to

385
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:24,540
fix

386
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,760
very easy generally easy metrics there's

387
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,459
a depth to that uh detection coverage is

388
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,199
one of my favorite one with more senior

389
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,420
people how do you actually measure

390
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,459
detection coverage it's a rat hole

391
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,440
there's no perfect answer there's no

392
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
perfect answer at least I haven't seen

393
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,279
one but I sure tried it there's a few

394
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,540
metrics there

395
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,279
detection tends to gravitate around

396
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,160
velocity of execution uh and also

397
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,440
quality of the SOP when you write the

398
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,260
SOP first your detection tends to be a

399
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,180
lot better right

400
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,779
um

401
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,660
how do you so we've talked about that

402
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,180
um understanding also who the customer

403
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,579
is speaking the voice of customer this

404
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,260
is an Amazon trick but it works at every

405
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,760
company

406
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,120
every company will work is engineers in

407
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,440
you is your customer if you're working

408
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,420
on Prozac your customers engineer focus

409
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,040
on that if you work on Enterprise

410
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,860
security everyone is a customer

411
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,600
show the empathy towards the customer

412
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,699
and understand what they're actually

413
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,160
facing versus always saying they're

414
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,860
stupid I've had so many people it's like

415
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,959
oh they're so they like they don't get

416
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,300
security don't say that I interview

417
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,860
you're just failing to communicate

418
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,279
that's basically what it is right uh do

419
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,940
not forget also the me versus we

420
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,920
one of the one thing I've realized

421
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,720
uh where I'm failing personally in

422
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,800
coaching is I've had several people I've

423
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,420
supported before that reported to me in

424
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,680
that past interview

425
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,300
and the feedback is they're way too

426
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,639
humble we don't quite know what they've

427
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,839
delivered versus what the team has

428
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,980
delivered

429
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,199
right so I have to emphasize like this

430
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,959
is the time for you I want to know what

431
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,699
you you do

432
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,339
connected back with the team later alone

433
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:11,160
I move fast together we move further so

434
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,500
don't forget actually the interview is

435
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,079
about you what have you done

436
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,780
I hear so many candidates saying we did

437
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,880
this we did that and we come in at the

438
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,720
end it's like there's some good

439
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,459
scenarios there but we have no clue what

440
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,740
that person actually did in a very

441
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,559
consistent basis so focus on you we're

442
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,679
interviewing you then roll back and how

443
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,780
you contributed back to the team and how

444
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,880
you supported the team

445
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,580
a very quick thing I know I have a few

446
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,860
minutes let's dive very briefly on on

447
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,120
more I would say skills

448
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,220
it is an absolute must in this day and

449
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,980
age learn to code

450
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,200
right how are you going to scale

451
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,539
yourself the environments are more and

452
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:57,840
more complex if emeriel's uh scale so

453
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,780
you have to code now I'm not asking

454
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,360
around building distributed networks and

455
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,700
building distributed systems and so on

456
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,620
as simple as I'll have an example

457
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,720
print write a function that prints zero

458
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,120
to one and every time the number is

459
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,020
divisible by two add an asterisk to it

460
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,179
they could not do that

461
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,460
right some of it were too nervous

462
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,620
there's practice round don't make the

463
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,480
interview the interview is game day

464
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,460
don't make it your practice round right

465
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,980
so you can go out there there's

466
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,820
interviewing.io and plenty of other

467
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,679
companies where you can go do these

468
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,919
things I personally use it I remember I

469
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,440
did a few interviews I think Meadow was

470
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,700
probably the hardest interview

471
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,520
technically I've done on coding I would

472
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,900
have completely bombed if I didn't

473
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,200
practice like facing a blinking cursor

474
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,820
and like please solve this algorithm

475
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,340
like you have to go you have to do those

476
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,700
right I just it wasn't in me I practiced

477
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,860
quite a bit I was very nervous but then

478
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,660
it wasn't the it wasn't the first time I

479
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,100
did it in front of them

480
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,919
right so coding learn to communicate

481
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,179
oops

482
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,640
learn to communicate as well as part of

483
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,860
your case study most of the challenge

484
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,419
you're going to face are not going to be

485
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,039
technical it's about actually driving

486
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,960
change within organization and people

487
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,299
and and speaking if all you're saying is

488
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,160
Doom days scenario they don't get it

489
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,600
they don't that I don't know what you

490
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,340
don't get is your failing to communicate

491
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,039
so work on that skills

492
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,140
one of the most important skill as well

493
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,340
is self-reflection

494
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,520
I emphasize on that self-reflection what

495
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,720
are your strengths what are your

496
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,980
superpowers

497
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,740
what are your weakness at grammarly we

498
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,900
have a very peculiar interview called

499
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,580
top rating where we walk through your

500
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,520
entire career ask the same question

501
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,440
what was the role what was the

502
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,179
strengthened weakness of your manager

503
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,360
what would you think your manager uh say

504
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,280
about your strength and weakness

505
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,460
and why did you leave for each job

506
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,919
we want to see self-reflection

507
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,840
thoughtful self-reflection whatever you

508
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,520
learned if you're saying your weakness

509
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,260
is the same over and over I had a case

510
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,580
like that recently

511
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,580
it's very clear to me he's stagnating

512
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,460
right he's that person is stagnating so

513
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,260
very quickly I know I'm about to get

514
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,640
booted off

515
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,140
um

516
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,200
learn how to how uh ask questions during

517
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,940
interview come prepare with some

518
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,760
meaningful question it starts out with

519
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,260
the recruiters initially what was the

520
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,059
role what was the style and so on so

521
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,160
very important don't ask about money

522
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,919
talk to the recruiter first I had a

523
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,720
worst case scenario recently someone

524
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,160
asked me

525
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,580
um do you guys have food for lunch

526
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,039
like maybe I'm full of myself but you're

527
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,780
talking to the hiring manager and that's

528
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,700
the only question you're coming up

529
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,620
even strong technically or that person

530
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,600
was strong technically but not really

531
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,840
prepared not the Right audience and

532
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,780
learn to fail gracefully

533
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,940
I have candidate asking me hey where did

534
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,620
I fail but I know right away is they're

535
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,640
going to challenge they're going to

536
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,160
argue it's not with good intent you can

537
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,500
generally ask people officially they

538
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,600
won't give you an answer HR is there and

539
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,220
so on but you can reach out to the

540
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,840
hiring manager and say like where did I

541
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,840
do wrong I'll make a call if I feel it's

542
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,900
genuine learning to know I learned to

543
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,820
say I don't know

544
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,740

567
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,380
all right we have time for a question or

568
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,240
two

569
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,520
yeah going back to what this fellow said

570
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,559
in terms of you had a candidate in front

571
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,960
of you he meets the criteria but there's

572
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,480
maybe one thing that he's lacking and

573
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,860
yes he could have overwritten everyone

574
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,020
and gone ahead and hire him

575
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,880
you pretty much answered it if he were

576
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,919
to reach out to you gracefully and say

577
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,659
hey look where did I fail where did I

578
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,760
Stumble would you respond to them

579
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,539
absolutely yeah absolutely I think

580
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,600
the the individuals spend the time I

581
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,220
think treat people the way you would be

582
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,500
treated the interviews I completely bomb

583
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,600
my bask I didn't always get an answer

584
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,760
something I I actually got pretty good

585
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,480
answer uh absolutely I follow up uh

586
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,240
legally I cannot in an official capacity

587
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,640
Nothing Stops from a quick conversation

588
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,720
a phone

589
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,140
no no

590
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,720
all right

591
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,440
mine is really quick just I I was

592
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,480
wondering if we not talking about like a

593
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,520
salary or whatever at the beginning of

594
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,400
the uh basically interview you're going

595
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,880
to like five interview at the end when

596
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,820
they offer you it's not the price you

597
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,820
interested on so it isn't better to ask

598
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,039
at the beginning to have that whole

599
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,860
conversation so both of us not wasting

600
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,140
time then like you going to 10 interview

601
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,960
and then it's like oh no sorry I think

602
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,200
money money and benefits is really

603
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,940
focused on uh sorry Focus those

604
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,220
questions with the recruiter if they're

605
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,659
recruiter doesn't ask you from the

606
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,020
get-go that's a red flag you should

607
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,700
but once you commit to the interview

608
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,340
don't don't mention it right

609
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,000
one of the the the top top interviews uh

610
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,559
I've seen I've actually seen people

611
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,780
uplift the level just by asking the

612
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,039
right question

613
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,500
I'll give you an example like grammarly

614
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,700
I I wanted to focus heavily on scope

615
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,520
and I did a reorder before I even joined

616
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,940
and I Define my own scope right

617
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,620
but I didn't bring this up until the

618
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,200
complete end I'm interested there let's

619
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,980
talk now right now you may not have that

620
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,659
quote-unquote luxury early in your

621
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,580
career

622
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,580
but focus on the scope what can you

623
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,080
learn from the company focus on the

624
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,360
scope the money will come at some point

625
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,280
you know at the end it's all about money

626
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,380
you got to go sign the deal but if the

627
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,820
money becomes the object of the

628
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,039
conversation for every case to me that's

629
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,659
just a red flag that's just not how I

630
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,240
hire uh personally

631
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,520
so talk about it ballpark with a

632
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,940
recruiter first don't mention it shine

633
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,640
come prepared make them interested in

634
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,840
you

635
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,059
and if they tell you we're moving to

636
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,039
offer you already know now

637
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,580
right now negotiate I've seen people

638
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,559
also bomb at the end

639
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,980
very cocky people oh I I've worked at so

640
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,960
and so I deserve x amount of money as I

641
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,580
I think the job you're looking for you

642
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,500
already have thank you

643
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,900
right I've I've had cases like that and

644
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,299
it sucks and it's a time to reflect how

645
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:28,740
could we have caught that earlier

646
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,299
because we also spent a lot of time

647
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,799
right

648
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,080
wonderful thank you Sasha another round
