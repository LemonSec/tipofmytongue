1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,419
hello good morning everyone

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:04,920
um welcome to the shortest talk at

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,379
B-side San Francisco it's good to be

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:08,580
here today I'm going to be talking about

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,500
Community cyber defense

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,059
um how everyday people are stepping up

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,920
to help their communities and how you

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,480
can get involved

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,580
but first a little bit about myself my

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,260
name is Sarah pawazik I direct the

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,820
public interest cyber security program

12
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,460
at the UC Berkeley Center for long-term

13
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,140
cyber security which is a very

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,359
long-winded way of saying that I spend

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,640
my time investigating and promoting

16
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,140
different ways to help organizations

17
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,940
that are under resourced with cyber

18
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,500
security and help them bolster their

19
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,780
defenses

20
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,860
there's a few different components of

21
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,420
public interest cyber security but I'll

22
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,300
keep it brief one is that it's focused

23
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,219
on community cyber security so we hear

24
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,020
the term National Security thrown around

25
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,539
a lot but really there are lots of

26
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,980
instances where something might not

27
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,660
qualify as a national security risk but

28
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,000
really has a profound impact on local

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,800
folks so for example like a food bank

30
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,379
being hit with ransomware maybe not a

31
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,480
national security risk but really

32
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,640
profoundly felt by folks who get their

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,019
meals from that food bank quite

34
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,119
immediately so that's what my program is

35
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,220
focused on and we also look at a

36
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,740
population level instead of a an asset

37
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,060
level so we're not thinking about what

38
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,680
we're trying to defend we're thinking

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,020
about what people were trying to defend

40
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,400
um who are the most vulnerable in our

41
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,840
communities and what services do those

42
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,939
folks rely on that if they were taken

43
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,040
away those those folks would struggle

44
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,420
the most so that's what we're trying to

45
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,799
concentrate our resources

46
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,840
so why is this work important

47
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,640
um you folks all already know this but

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,259
I'll say it again

49
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,540
um the most at risk organizations in the

50
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,340
country right now are some of the least

51
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,720
prepared to deal with cyber security

52
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,780
threats I'm talking about cities for

53
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,759
example right even the city of Oakland

54
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,799
where many of us live and work just last

55
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,720
month was hit with ransomware it's

56
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,840
becoming really a weekly occurrence and

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,060
they're really real impacts for these

58
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,860
sorts of organizations getting hit um

59
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,079
cities provide marriage licenses they

60
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,700
provide 9-1-1 and other Emergency

61
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,140
Services housing and eviction Services

62
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,340
non-profits I mentioned food banks

63
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,920
institutions of Faith folks providing

64
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,199
free legal services and Refugee

65
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,180
assistance and public infrastructure so

66
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,660
not just the large ICS institutions but

67
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,900
also small isps small water providers

68
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,000
all of these folks are very very low

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,800
resource some of them might not even

70
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
have a single cyber security staff many

71
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,940
of them don't even have a single it

72
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,520
person uh at their institution so

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,900
they're really really struggling and

74
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,340
they need more assistance than we're

75
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,739
able to provide and before I jump into

76
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,599
why you should volunteer I'll say that

77
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,800
there are a lot of folks at the federal

78
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,540
level doing absolutely incredible work

79
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,060
to try and make this problem better

80
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,440
we're Prosecuting ransomware actors

81
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,819
they're making more funding available

82
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:48,000
for local institutions lots of really

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,280
great work but the reality is that

84
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,080
almost every organization is affected by

85
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,180
cyber security and it's just not going

86
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,620
to be enough unless all of us get

87
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,780
involved and try and help exactly where

88
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,239
we live and work and if that hasn't

89
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,680
convinced you already here's a bunch of

90
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,000
good reasons why you should consider

91
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,920
volunteering you get to see the direct

92
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,480
impact of your work you get to hang out

93
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,940
with in my opinion the coolest people in

94
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,440
cyber security the ones who are trying

95
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,019
to do it for free in their spare time

96
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,900
what little may be

97
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,400
and you might make a real difference so

98
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,780
you might be the difference between a

99
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,940
small business shutting down and being

100
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,440
able to stay afloat because you helps

101
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,720
them bolster their cyber defenses

102
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,940
so in my remaining time I'm trying to

103
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,800
get through three major groups of

104
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,319
volunteering organizations what sorts of

105
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,819
programs they've started up and how you

106
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,459
can get involved Academia local

107
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,280
government and private sector individual

108
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,659
volunteers who are working out of

109
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,580
non-profits

110
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,400
so we'll start with Academia you may not

111
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,200
know this but Academia actually has a

112
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,780
really rich history of training students

113
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,780
to do public service so you see this in

114
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,400
medical school clinics where Med

115
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,140
students work in clinics to give out

116
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,780
free health care you see it with law

117
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,420
students who are spending time in a pro

118
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,040
bono Clinic to give out free legal

119
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,860
services and so in 2018 a number of

120
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,080
academic institutions wondered why

121
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,280
aren't we doing this for cyber security

122
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,900
we have all these students who need Real

123
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,239
World Experience they they don't know

124
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,620
how to break into the industry and we

125
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,180
have all these organizations like right

126
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,418
next door that need our help and so they

127
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,220
thought what if we created a cyber

128
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,839
security Clinic we'll take these

129
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,000
students not just computer science

130
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,100
students but law students people from

131
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,960
political science

132
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,720
um you know folks folks in human rights

133
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,340
will bring them all in and we'll teach

134
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,699
them to do a basic cyber risk assessment

135
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,080
provide some basic recommendations to

136
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,880
these organizations and we'll do it all

137
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
for free we'll give them course credit

138
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,900
or internship paid internship experience

139
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,340
and

140
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,100
they did it um so UC Berkeley and MIT

141
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,800
led the charge but we're now up to nine

142
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
institutions across the country that are

143
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,940
providing these free services I help

144
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,340
organize the Consortium and we've

145
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,380
trained over 730 students to perform

146
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,300
these assessments to get to get better

147
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,800
jobs in the field

148
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,360
um we've served over 120 Community

149
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,000
organizations for free so this includes

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,520
now I mentioned MIT and UC Berkeley a

151
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,780
number of Institutions from the

152
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,340
University of Texas University of

153
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,620
Alabama University of Georgia Indiana

154
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,440
University in Colombia

155
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,840
local governments so now we're talking

156
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,540
about local government creating programs

157
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,400
to help organizations within their state

158
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,100
borders they are creating incident

159
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,419
response core programs you might have

160
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,460
heard of mic3 before the Michigan cyber

161
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,759
Corps program but there are also more

162
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,900
proactive programs where they're

163
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,880
providing risk assessments and threat

164
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,259
intelligence and other sorts of

165
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,960
resources and this doesn't sound very

166
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,300
voluntary until I tell you that many of

167
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,639
these programs are actually training

168
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,620
recruiting and certifying folks from the

169
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,360
Private Industry to act as sort of a

170
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,820
cyber Reserve Corps and are called in to

171
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,860
help respond to Major cyber incidents

172
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,280
within the state so mic3 is one Ohio and

173
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,840
Wisconsin have also started up these

174
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,039
programs where they're able to leverage

175
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,139
folks in the private sector again in

176
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,639
their spare time to help respond

177
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,620
particularly to those sorts of incidents

178
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,600
where they wouldn't be able to contact a

179
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,220
professional incident response firm

180
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,160
particularly cities and municipalities

181
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,800
so um only a few states that started up

182
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,240
these programs as you can see from this

183
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,500
map from the national Governors

184
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,539
Association but it has caught on in

185
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:20,160
recent years and there's a lot of

186
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,479
different services that these folks

187
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:23,160
provide sometimes they operate year

188
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,840
round so if there aren't incidents

189
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,160
they're trying to do proactive Outreach

190
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,720
and other things

191
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,340
um really really interesting program and

192
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,500
really catching on very quickly

193
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,660
and finally trying to leave some room

194
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,100
for questions

195
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,900
um there are non-profit programs so

196
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,819
these may be familiar to already I'll go

197
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,580
over a few of them these are mainly

198
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,220
folks from the community starting up

199
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,020
programs and trying to fill these gaps

200
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,160
in service when they're seeing these

201
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,419
organizations that just don't have the

202
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,340
resources that they need that the CTI

203
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,500
league is a big one it was founded by a

204
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,120
group of hackers in 2020 during the

205
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,520
covid-19 pandemic when they saw that

206
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,319
Healthcare infrastructure in hospitals

207
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,940
in particular were really vulnerable to

208
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,800
cyber threats because of how overwhelmed

209
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,960
they were with the pandemic and so they

210
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,300
did things like um in 2020 this is a

211
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,100
release some threat indicators they

212
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,500
ticked those indicators they actually

213
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,539
identified some C2 infrastructure they

214
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,000
helped with lawful takedowns and they

215
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,919
were able to track and try and

216
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,020
proactively notify victims of those

217
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,599
attacks I'm the Cavalry is also an

218
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,979
incredible program they've been around

219
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,900
for a decade now they started up in 2013

220
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,360
also by a group of hackers they have a

221
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,580
really broad scope of work

222
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,160
um on policy and on hacking and

223
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
identifying vulnerabilities particularly

224
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,319
in the automotive industry and in um

225
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,539
like healthcare and and Healthcare tools

226
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,699
and they also run an incredible program

227
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,020
called hackers on the hill where they

228
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,120
bring in folks like you to give

229
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,220
technical input into public policy right

230
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,479
in Congress

231
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,460
and I'll round it out with a cyberpiece

232
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,319
Builders this is an initiative from the

233
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,380
Cyber peace Institute their non-profit

234
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,020
based in uh Switzerland the city is

235
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,160
escaping me

236
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,840
um they're great so this program they

237
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,539
match volunteers with discrete tasks so

238
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,699
say I'm an organization that needs help

239
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,860
configuring my firewall rules they will

240
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,380
pair one or two volunteers with that

241
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,120
organization they complete that task

242
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,740
then they're done it's a really

243
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,720
ingenious idea of helping move the

244
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,160
needle a little bit for a lot of

245
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,500
organizations

246
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,639
while understanding that a lot of folks

247
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,080
in Private Industry really only have

248
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,300
like an extra hour to a week if that

249
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,680
maybe a month

250
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,360
um so they they're training hundreds of

251
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
folks I think they have 300 volunteers

252
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,099
and over 700 hours that folks have put

253
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,580
into this

254
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:35,580
um

255
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,860
oh no I've been on the wrong slide you

256
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,320
guys okay here is this slide I'll leave

257
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,299
it up very briefly so that you can see

258
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,919
these programs that I've been talking

259
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,080
about with no slide behind me

260
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,060
okay

261
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,980
um in conclusion

262
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,240
um so I hope if you take something away

263
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,980
from this presentation

264
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,720
um it's that people really need you and

265
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,339
you can make a difference with Knowledge

266
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,800
and Skills that you already have

267
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,180
um there are lots of programs that I

268
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,740
mentioned today that would love your

269
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,360
help you should check out if your state

270
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,040
has one of those volunteer cyber core

271
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,440
programs if there's a cyber clinic in

272
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,760
your state that you could offer services

273
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,519
to if one of those non-profit programs

274
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,279
you'd be interested in joining or start

275
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,019
something yourself we're really not at

276
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,380
the point where we can go to bed and not

277
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,760
worry about something really critical

278
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,160
falling victim to ransomware

279
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,660
um and and in the meantime we're all

280
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,339
going to need to to play a role in

281
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:28,560
helping in particular the low resource

282
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,260
folks who really don't have the money or

283
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,360
the knowledge to protect themselves in

284
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,980
advance and I'll end with a quote from

285
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,839
the Wisconsin CIO talking about one of

286
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,240
the Cyber Corps programs one of these

287
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,040
people show UPS on site during an

288
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,260
incident they stop the bleeding and they

289
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,240
fix problems so I hope you'll all join

290
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,980
me in stopping the bleeding and fixing

291
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,380
problems until one day hopefully we

292
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,760
don't have any more problems to fix

293
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,959
anymore thank you

294
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,320
I think I have a couple minutes for

295
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,279
questions if folks have any

296
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,100
like a volunteer organization

297
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,980
unfortunately no the NGA site is a good

298
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,300
place to start if you want to learn more

299
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,760
about the cybercore programs for those

300
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,200
non-profits you'll have to look up their

301
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,580
websites individually and they have more

302
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,760
information

303
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,700
uh I would say that the folks that you

304
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,560
want to talk to really differ depending

305
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,720
on the state each of them tries to house

306
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,240
their cyber activities in a different

307
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,760
department I'd say the office of

308
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,560
emergency management or the National

309
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,420
Guard are generally where those programs

310
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,459
are hosted and if you look at the NGA

311
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,019
study that I referenced they have a

312
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,300
section on authorities sometimes they've

313
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,860
actually needed to pass legislation to

314
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,420
give them the authority to to pull in

315
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,640
private folks to respond to these so I'd

316
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,839
say if you could get in touch with

317
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,040
someone

318
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,500
um in in the the office of emergency

319
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,240
management and see where that cyber

320
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,740
activity is concentrated those are the

321
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,000
folks you'll want to talk to about those

322
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,279
programs mm-hmm

323
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,959
any other questions

324
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,180
all right happy to chat more after this

325
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,040
talk and I'll say if you like the idea

326
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,839
of community cyber defense UC Berkeley's

327
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,579
hosting a conference this June 14th in

328
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,500
DC called the Cyber civil defense Summit

329
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,300
we'll be having panels with the folks

330
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,560
who are running these programs to talk

331
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,300
about them how they can collaborate and

332
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,680
scale and so I hope to see you there

333
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,279
thanks so much
