2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,680
wonderful

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,000
thank you very much for joining this

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,280
talk and good morning

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,880
and thank you to josh to all the

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,559
volunteers and to everybody that's

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,560
making this possible today

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,160
i wish that i was there with you in

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,240
seattle but i'm located in spain

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,600
so i guess this is the the win of the

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,080
situation is that we get to meet over

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,119
over the internet

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,599
and have a conversation and so before we

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,560
start to talk about

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,160
trust in security culture who am i

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,960
and why am i talking to you about this

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,280
hi

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,680
i'm annie i work as a security culture

and authorization services for

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,800
developers

which is a non-profit that aims to

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,719
connect women that work in the cyber

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,559
security field and

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,120
share trainings networking opportunities

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,320
and so on

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
and you can find me in twitter if you

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,879
like to continue the conversation

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,479
any questions i will also be in the

33
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,720
discord channel and so as a security

34
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,320
culture manager i work

35
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,439
with people security full time and i'm

36
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,200
really passionate about it

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,759
and throughout this time i've done a lot

38
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,640
of research

39
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,600
on different topics like behavioral

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,479
economics

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,240
influence negotiation

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,439
how can we change people's mindset

43
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,600
and so what i'm presenting to you today

44
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,720
is

45
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,119
is like putting all of that research

46
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:35,920
into

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,079
a 50 minute presentation mixing

48
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,200
everything up

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
and finding the core of the topic

50
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,439
essentially so that's what we'll discuss

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,840
today

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,560
and before we get started i would like

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,680
to ask you

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
what do you see when you look at this

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,240
picture with your infosec

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,680
lens i know it's just people essentially

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
but depending on on your perspective

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
maybe you see a group of people that

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,199
might be insider friends to the company

60
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,560
or just like warner boggles for instance

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,160
he might see idiots that just click

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,160
keep on clicking on the link over and

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,920
over and over again

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,879
or maybe you might see conflictive

65
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,160
engineers

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,760
that just keep on coding the same

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,160
vulnerabilities over and over again

68
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,160
or maybe that don't fix them fast enough

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,519
now maybe that's what comes to mind

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,360
when you look at this picture bugs

71
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,920
vulnerabilities

72
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,680
human ever just waiting to happen

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,440
now let me tell you what i see and

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,200
especially after doing

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,239
all of this research what i see when i

76
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,080
look at this picture

77
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
is opportunity maybe the most

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,159
important and the most undertapped

79
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,599
opportunity we have

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,720
because is it a ridiculous idea to say

81
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,519
that if we get all of that people to

82
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,080
think

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,800
and behave securely then we can make the

84
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,640
internet a safer place

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,599
in a scalable way i don't think that's

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,840
that's a crazy idea i think it's

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,360
i think it's something that we can

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,080
achieve if we

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,959
if we actually put ourselves into doing

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,159
it

91
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,040
now why do we need to essentially take

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,640
this opportunity in

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,280
and take advantage of this gold mine

94
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
that people represent

95
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,519
well if i was with you in seattle in

96
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,319
person

97
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,920
i would ask you to raise your hand if

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,640
you think that the cyber security

99
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,720
industry and everything if the internet

100
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,440
is is a safe place if we if everything

101
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
is fine

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,879
i think it's not so we have bridges all

103
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,560
over the place

104
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,159
security incidents happening all the

105
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,920
time i think we

106
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,439
have a problem that we must fix

107
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,200
and the people side of things is

108
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,439
something that we haven't really

109
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,239
touched too much maybe we have some very

110
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,239
boring and long trainings

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,560
but i think that people represent the

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,280
goldmine

113
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,680
of opportunity that can really make an

114
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,319
impact

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,080
and that could help make the internet

116
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,079
safer it just becomes

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,279
a question of how we have an opportunity

118
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,400
we know why we must

119
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,440
take it how do we do it

120
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,600
and so what i'm proposing today then

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,199
again it's my perspective

122
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,320
it's a set of ideas that have come from

123
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
from a lot of research but it's what

124
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,479
it's it's just a perspective and i love

125
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,000
to share with you

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,120
so i would like to explain this with

127
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,919
with an example imagine we have company

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:44,639
full

129
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,240
and we have company bar and company foo

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,360
everything is

131
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,280
full so so here the security team

132
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,960
is feared people are afraid of us

133
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,639
we are the naysayers or the police

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,440
we just say no all the time they might

135
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,759
be

136
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,720
afraid we might they might feel that we

137
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,680
blame them all the time

138
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,479
they don't care or want to hear anything

139
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,639
about security at all

140
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,479
and whenever we try to do anything or to

141
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,600
maybe put out a process policy

142
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,759
something it feels like fighting an

143
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,120
uphill battle

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,320
everything is just very very difficult

145
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,479
and if we have a security incident or an

146
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,960
issue in company foo

147
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,160
then we are not resilient it's

148
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,440
it cost a lot of money to fix

149
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,560
and it's a very dangerous situation

150
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
so essentially we don't want to be in

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
company food

152
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
but i would dare to say that there are

153
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
many company foods out there

154
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,800
maybe this is how you feel it's a toxic

155
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,199
or

156
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,360
a difficult work environment to be in

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
and we have company power

158
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,160
company bar is opposite completely

159
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,720
opposite

160
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,520
here we have collaboration and the

161
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,280
security team is seen

162
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,560
we people are not afraid of us they they

163
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,360
engage with us they care about security

164
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
and have a secure mindset

165
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,080
they grow and learn about security they

166
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,720
consider

167
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,759
it's it's an important part of their

168
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,440
professional selves

169
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,520
and of their personal lives as well they

170
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
want to

171
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,360
learn and engage with us and here

172
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,080
instead of

173
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,560
things being an uphill battle it feels

174
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,840
like going downhill

175
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,880
instead everything is much easier much

176
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,479
simpler

177
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,840
there's less friction and and overall

178
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
issues and so maybe in company bar

179
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,759
we will have a security incident there

180
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,600
will be security vulnerabilities for

181
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,400
sure

182
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,960
i'm not saying that this can be

183
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,039
completely eliminated

184
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,400
however in company bar i bet that we

185
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
will be more resilient

186
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,479
that we will fix him faster and and

187
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,840
everything will feel better

188
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,120
overall and i would dare to say that

189
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,440
everybody should want to work at company

190
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,160
bar

191
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,039
where security is valued people care

192
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,840
about it

193
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,880
we engage and people engage with us it's

194
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,280
a

195
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,800
it's a much better environment to be in

196
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,960
and if you put these two companies side

197
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,199
by side and if you start to think

198
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,800
at the core of the issue what

199
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,160
differentiates them we can

200
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,960
put that into a single word and that's

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,240
trust

202
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,199
because ultimately without trust there

203
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,240
is absolutely no room whatsoever

204
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,000
for collaboration or engagement

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,120
and learning there's no room

206
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,639
for for essentially anything that have

207
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,680
anything to happen

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,960
in this context people will not

209
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,599
engage with us the right way they won't

210
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,840
care about security

211
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,120
trust is the one thing that changes

212
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,319
company 2

213
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,840
to become company bar now trust

214
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,160
i think it's a it might be a difficult

215
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,039
word for us

216
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,919
a difficult concept because we're used

217
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:14,879
to think about

218
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,720
zero trust and trust but make sure

219
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,240
that you always verify or every social

220
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,919
engineering attack happens

221
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,039
because people trust too easily

222
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,960
and we may even consider that it's a

223
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,879
fluffy topic

224
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,640
hearts and and rainbows

225
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,679
however trust at the core

226
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,240
it's a skill and it's and it's

227
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,279
actionable

228
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,680
it's measurable and it leads to economic

229
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,200
growth so if you get good at inspiring

230
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,760
trust and being a trustworthy person

231
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,080
then it this ultimately leads to better

232
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,600
results

233
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,160
and there are studies that show that

234
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,880
companies

235
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,600
or organizations that are high trust

236
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
environments

237
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,240
get things done three times faster

238
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,040
and a lot cheaper because when there's

239
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,440
trust

240
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,320
between two teams and which into orgs

241
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,720
that everything just happens faster

242
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,200
and everything is just cheaper

243
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,640
financially

244
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,959
and time-wise so we want to get good

245
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,080
at generating trust and

246
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,560
trust at the core if we study it it

247
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,320
starts with each of us

248
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,800
individually with the trust that we have

249
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
in ourselves

250
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,720
and then after that it goes to our

251
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,080
relationships

252
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,399
the trust we have with every single one

253
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,760
of our teammates

254
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,320
and everyone else in the in the company

255
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,240
then that goes into the org

256
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,640
and then that leads to market trust and

257
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,920
so

258
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,480
and trust in the society but the one we

259
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
care about the most

260
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,120
for this topic and for this area is

261
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,240
relationship trust

262
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,959
and then organizational trust so that's

263
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,800
what we'll talk about today

264
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
and let's define it before we go into

265
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,920
the security side of it

266
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
let's understand class a little bit

267
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,959
better because then again

268
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,160
it's not a fluffy topic and

269
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,040
and we might we might think that it it

270
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,440
just has to do with kindness and honesty

271
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,880
and integrity

272
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,440
however when it comes to work settings

273
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,000
trust

274
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,279
is a measure of two things character

275
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,240
and competence so on the character side

276
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,640
you have

277
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,040
integrity and you have intent and on the

278
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,640
competent side you have

279
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,880
capabilities and results but let's

280
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,720
explain those two things

281
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,959
more so character the roots

282
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,079
of trust is your integrity and this is

283
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,279
your honesty

284
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,000
your congress is what you say and what

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,800
you think

286
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
align with what you do the courage you

287
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,560
have to speak up

288
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,040
for what you believe in the right way

289
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,920
and the humility you have to

290
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
accept that you made a mistake to learn

291
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,839
from others to accept

292
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,959
other people's ideas then after

293
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,480
integrity you have intent

294
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,760
and this is having a good purpose and

295
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,880
a good motive for doing things having

296
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,000
the right agenda

297
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,600
not not a hidden agenda not not seeking

298
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,000
self um win but seeking to have

299
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,200
a win-win for everybody involved and

300
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,440
generally caring for others and

301
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,640
ultimately we have

302
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,320
our behaviors so our purpose

303
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,480
translates to our motive which goes into

304
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,880
our agenda and then this leads to

305
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,480
what we actually do and we have to think

306
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,200
and do and providing the best for others

307
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
and after we have character

308
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,920
you must also have competence because

309
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,480
maybe

310
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,920
you will trust somebody with high

311
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
character and trustworthy character

312
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,519
to watch over your pet perhaps but when

313
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,079
it comes to

314
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,800
work we must also showcase capabilities

315
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,000
and results

316
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and on the capability sides we have our

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,160
talent whatever comes to us

318
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,959
naturally we also have our attitudes our

319
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,959
growth mindset for example

320
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,639
the skills we have and the fact that

321
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,040
we're always learning drawing

322
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,639
sharing all the knowledge we accumulate

323
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,760
and the style we have and ultimately at

324
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,399
the peak

325
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,839
of the tree of trust we have our results

326
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,920
this is the performance we have

327
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,959
our past our present and an anticipated

328
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,880
performance

329
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,920
and methods that we use to achieve those

330
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,600
results

331
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,000
meaning not stepping on everybody's in

332
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
anybody's toes

333
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
seeking to have win-win and when it

334
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
comes to results it's not just tangible

335
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,600
outcomes but also

336
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,639
learning is a good result supporting

337
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,880
someone else's goals is also a good

338
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,839
result

339
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,920
it's not just a metric so to speak

340
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,480
so we have those two things so and now

341
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,639
we understand that if somebody

342
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,279
has integrity has good intent is a

343
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,000
capable person that also has results

344
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,560
then that is the most trustworthy person

345
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,680
like that you can be

346
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,399
and that leads to our relationships as

347
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,760
well

348
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,560
and this not only this is good for you

349
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,200
overall

350
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,120
in your personal life in your

351
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,320
professional life

352
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,880
these skills will just make you better

353
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,440
and

354
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,639
social skills or soft skills

355
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,040
they don't go outdated so this is just

356
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,720
overall good for you

357
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,600
but it's also good for the security of

358
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
the organization

359
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,040
in the domain of culture security

360
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,240
culture

361
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,519
so culture is essentially what people do

362
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,360
when no one is watching

363
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,480
is the behaviors the

364
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,480
values the way that people just

365
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,000
act on a company level so first we have

366
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,199
the company culture

367
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,440
and this is the overall organizational

368
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,880
culture

369
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,760
this is the values of the company the

370
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,240
way

371
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,720
even the way that people dress is part

372
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,480
of the company culture

373
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,959
but within that culture there is always

374
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,720
a security culture

375
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,279
and this is a way that people think

376
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,040
behave

377
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,600
and the way that people react to

378
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,560
security

379
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,440
and this is people in engineering

380
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,120
marketing sales

381
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,600
everybody security is something that

382
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,240
touches

383
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,040
on everyone's everyone's role

384
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,560
essentially

385
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,480
so this if you become if you're a

386
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,600
trustworthy person

387
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,199
and and the security team is a

388
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,199
trustworthy organization

389
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,279
this leads to to a better overall

390
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,440
security culture

391
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,199
and ultimately culture drives behavior

392
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,519
not policies not processes

393
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,440
but the culture of the company is what

394
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,199
actually drives the way

395
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,079
that people act in the organization and

396
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,839
if we want to take that opportunity we

397
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,120
have discussed before

398
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,240
where we want developers to code

399
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,040
securely

400
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,000
we want people not to click on facial

401
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
links or report issues

402
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,920
we want people to think and have a

403
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,680
security mindset

404
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,360
it all comes down to culture

405
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,920
because that's what leads or that drives

406
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
behaviors

407
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,959
so i really like this explanation about

408
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,040
the different types of security cultures

409
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,480
that a company might have

410
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,839
and and any any company won't have

411
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,720
just a single type of one of these but a

412
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,440
mix

413
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,839
of everything and if we have a tight

414
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,480
control

415
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,880
and an internal focus company we have a

416
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,800
process culture

417
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,279
this is the company that just seeks to

418
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,079
enforce

419
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,199
policies everything is very rigid here

420
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:51,600
there's

421
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
barely no room for innovation or

422
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,160
creativity

423
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,519
here we have everything standardized

424
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,040
everything is a policy and there's not a

425
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,759
lot of room

426
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,199
for collaboration even now we have

427
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,199
tight control but if we focus externally

428
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,279
then we have the compliance culture or

429
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,120
the checklist culture

430
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,440
here we just want to pass audits

431
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,560
essentially

432
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,399
and then again we also have everything

433
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,759
documented and there are many standards

434
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,160
but there's also very little room for

435
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,680
collaboration as well

436
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,800
and and it might feel very

437
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,320
rigid as well if we go

438
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,199
to lose control but we focus externally

439
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,279
we have the autonomy culture

440
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,120
and here the directive is to get results

441
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,920
just one result i call this the shipit

442
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,800
culture

443
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,720
and i think that a lot of a lot of

444
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,040
startups might

445
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,000
might initially have an autonomy culture

446
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,199
when they are

447
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,240
growing and expanding and here people

448
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
have a lot of freedom

449
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,360
to essentially innovate and and

450
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,079
decisions are not made in a hierarchical

451
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,799
way but

452
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,919
it's pushed out to everybody and this

453
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:10,559
can be

454
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,359
a little bit of a chaos in a way when it

455
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,359
comes to security

456
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,640
and then we have when it go to internal

457
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,559
focus and i lose control

458
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,679
we have our trust culture so that's what

459
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,039
we now know what trust

460
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,360
is there is there is this this

461
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,280
we can't have a security culture of

462
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,360
trust and here we focus

463
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
on empowering people and on growing

464
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,840
human relations

465
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,480
in a trust culture people are

466
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,760
knowledgeable

467
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,720
they are committed they are accountable

468
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,160
and they they're engaged

469
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,559
they consider that security is part of

470
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,440
their job and part of what they do

471
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,559
and so in this culture this is the the

472
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,679
most

473
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,799
easiest way that we have to scale as an

474
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,600
organization

475
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,720
and to really make all the company more

476
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,600
secure

477
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,360
and ultimately make the internet safer

478
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,440
now the question is how do we generate

479
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,679
a security culture of trust in our

480
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,440
organization

481
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,640
it becomes a question of how again so

482
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,799
this is my my proposal and and what i

483
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,080
what i've come up with after mixing

484
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,760
all of this research i've done that

485
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,840
considers different topics

486
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,320
so in order to have trust i believe that

487
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,360
wimbas have

488
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,240
two pillars on one side the security

489
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
organization

490
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,520
in the company is a trustworthy

491
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,400
organization

492
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,440
so we are people-centric we consider

493
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,280
that people represent this

494
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,080
opportunity that we want to take and we

495
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,200
put a lot of effort

496
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,320
into building that layer

497
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,160
in our program we seek to have change

498
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,880
through influence rather than enforcing

499
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,000
something

500
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
enforcing a policy or

501
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,000
mandating people to change their mindset

502
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,080
we influence them instead

503
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,880
we seek mutual benefit so we don't just

504
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,320
consider security

505
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,200
but we want everybody to win and

506
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,440
everybody to achieve their goals

507
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
and so that's on one side and on the

508
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
other side we have our company

509
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,640
allies everybody in the company

510
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,520
becomes a security ally and they are

511
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,400
knowledgeable

512
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,000
so they know about security between

513
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
their

514
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,960
within their needs and their

515
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,679
domain they are committed they're

516
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,280
engaged with us

517
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,640
and they feel responsible for security

518
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,440
i believe this is what we we can

519
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,160
consider having that security mindset

520
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,880
that we wish we had a little bit more of

521
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,919
so we have these two pillars

522
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,400
how do we build them so we want to have

523
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,280
a security

524
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,240
culture of trust then each party must

525
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,720
make

526
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,360
trust deposits so i'd like to say it

527
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
this way

528
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
essentially imagine that you have this

529
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,039
trust account in your organization

530
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,559
and every time you behave in a

531
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,720
trustworthy manner or you

532
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,919
influence someone or maybe a developer

533
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,520
considers security or

534
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,799
somebody reports a fission link we make

535
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,000
trust deposits

536
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,799
essentially now if you're a leader in

537
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,000
the organization

538
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,840
and you have a a bigger sphere of

539
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,039
influence

540
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,360
then you can make larger deposits but

541
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,960
that doesn't mean that individual

542
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,919
contributors

543
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,720
and or anybody essentially can help this

544
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,600
to happen

545
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,000
then again trust starts with each of us

546
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,720
so we want to make as many deposits as

547
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,799
we can

548
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,799
and as as as constantly as possible

549
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,120
and here are some ideas how we can do

550
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,080
that

551
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,000
on our side and if you want to change

552
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,880
the world we can start with ourselves

553
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,919
so first is the concept of win-win

554
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,799
mindset

555
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,960
so here we consider

556
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,280
essentially the security teams considers

557
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,240
the goals

558
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,960
of everybody else in the company so for

559
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,799
instance we want to help

560
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,240
sales sell more in a secure way we want

561
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,880
engineers to be able to ship

562
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,080
more ship better ship faster

563
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,280
securely we want marketing to be able to

564
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,400
do their job

565
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,720
and in a secure way so that means that

566
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,120
we consider other people's in other

567
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,840
works

568
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,120
goals and priorities as well

569
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,600
we don't just consider security and we

570
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,080
think that everything must be secure

571
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,280
without considering the needs

572
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,559
the constraints the risks

573
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,000
of everyone else in the work as well

574
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,760
we seek everybody to win win

575
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,480
essentially this acknowledges the fact

576
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,280
that

577
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,080
between any company we're all part of

578
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,360
the same team

579
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,400
maybe we play defense and everybody and

580
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,000
someone else plays a goalie

581
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,480
but we all want we all have the same

582
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,120
goal

583
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,600
we should all seek to win together as

584
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,360
much as possible

585
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,039
so shifting our mindset for just

586
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,120
considering security and security at all

587
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,559
costs

588
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,559
to a win-win mindset then after that

589
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,520
we must i believe have strong customer

590
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,080
service

591
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,200
principles so whenever somebody

592
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,400
in any company whenever somebody has

593
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,440
a question or like how do i

594
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,080
enable mfa how do i report a phishing

595
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,360
email

596
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,760
how do i get a threat model or a risk

597
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,880
assessment or report a vulnerability

598
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,000
having a good customer service is key

599
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,720
for the engagement that we need and so

600
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,640
these principles

601
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,880
are are absolutely key for to have a

602
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,000
good service

603
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,360
first is approachability how is it

604
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,880
how is it decision to contact the

605
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,480
security team

606
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,440
do we have an email or a ticketing

607
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,320
system

608
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,039
a channeling slack can people send me a

609
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,400
direct message maybe

610
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,679
with that scale what's the easiest way i

611
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,240
can

612
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,360
i can do to help people reach out to me

613
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,559
what's our turnout voice do we sound

614
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,720
or do we sound like we want to help them

615
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,400
or are we we don't we we hide

616
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,960
from the requests for instance and

617
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,240
what's our reputation

618
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,080
so for instance if we are a security

619
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,440
team and we don't

620
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,520
we don't participate in company-wide

621
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,799
activities

622
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,720
or people don't see us in the office

623
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
in the slack channels we have no

624
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,760
disability

625
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,400
and the reputation that we have is is

626
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,000
negative

627
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,039
like the naysayers or the police and

628
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,760
this

629
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,559
makes us less approachable for instance

630
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,600
somebody

631
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,640
might feel concerned or afraid to reach

632
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,440
out to us

633
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,240
but we can improve that after we are

634
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,080
approachable then we must show

635
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,840
interest in the in the query and in the

636
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,600
customer so we create a safe space for

637
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,480
the user

638
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,880
this means that no matter the question

639
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,559
that's being asked

640
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,840
no matter anything at all we show

641
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,279
empathy and we show that we care

642
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,240
and then after that we actively listen

643
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:34,640
so

644
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,679
this is listening or reading

645
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,039
the query to understand not to reply

646
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,080
but just to understand the situation the

647
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,360
problem

648
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,880
what's happening not interrupting

649
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,120
the the person when they're talking and

650
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,720
paying attention to what the user

651
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,440
doesn't say

652
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,640
so sometimes they sure might not express

653
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,880
themselves the right way and they and we

654
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,240
might see something

655
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,279
that they're not saying and then

656
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,760
interviewing so asking questions to

657
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,720
clarify

658
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,679
but not in an accusatory manner and here

659
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,400
this

660
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,799
this is a lesson that i had to learn and

661
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,400
i sort of learned the hard way

662
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,880
i used to ask why do people a lot

663
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,000
because i believe in

664
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,360
that that we must always do things

665
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,080
for a reason so why do we have to do

666
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,559
this

667
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,600
and not that for instance however that

668
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,360
why in general it makes people

669
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,520
feel accused so we can shift

670
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,440
something like why did you do this to

671
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,080
what caused this to happen how did this

672
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,440
happen

673
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,600
shifting what from why to what or how

674
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,799
can really make a difference and i

675
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,120
i invite you to try it out maybe with a

676
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,240
friend

677
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,000
your family of anybody

678
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,960
try not using why use it what or how

679
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,919
instead

680
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,320
and the conversation will likely be more

681
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,960
fluid

682
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,000
and and feel better on both sides

683
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,480
then answering so we always thank people

684
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
for reaching out to us

685
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,279
some people it might be hard then again

686
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,000
we might

687
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,960
feel a little bit intimidating maybe

688
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,760
that person

689
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,360
used to have had a bad experience before

690
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,919
so we make them feel good we thank them

691
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,760
we praise them for contacting the

692
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,600
security team

693
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,720
and this then again this is another tip

694
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,200
that i

695
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,640
strongly encourage you to try remove

696
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,840
no problem and you're welcome and change

697
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,400
that

698
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,880
for any time habit of help

699
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,120
and things like that things that show

700
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,200
that you are genuinely happy

701
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
for helping the person instead of making

702
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,320
it look like you did them a favor

703
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,200
or that they were actually bothering you

704
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,600
no

705
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
make it look that you are happy to help

706
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,039
so this

707
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,679
i i invite you to try it out as well and

708
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,720
then follow it up

709
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,919
so we have our our slas

710
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,320
we keep them and if we set when we're

711
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,440
going to do something by

712
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
extant we do it or we manage

713
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,679
that expectation so we have customer

714
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,559
service

715
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,039
and principles and we have an excellent

716
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,120
customer service

717
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,080
then we have communication which is the

718
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,440
key

719
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,880
theme overall first we communicate

720
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,399
with touch and with empathy not with

721
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,440
blame

722
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,399
or not without caring we genuinely care

723
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,000
for the person

724
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,799
and we can communicate as tactfully as

725
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,159
we can

726
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,279
we keep our commitments so then again

727
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,840
we said we're going to do something we

728
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,720
do it

729
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,840
we set up a reminder anything we need

730
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,600
but we do it when we said we were going

731
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,360
to do or we manage

732
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,840
the expectation we created explaining

733
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,720
why i think this is absolutely key

734
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,000
to gain adoption because

735
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,559
people might not understand why they

736
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,600
need to follow

737
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,960
a control process a policy so explain

738
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,320
why does it exist what problem is it

739
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,039
solving

740
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,679
why should they do it then they will

741
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,240
have

742
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,840
a far better understanding of the

743
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,200
situation

744
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,159
and they will adopt it faster and they

745
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:32,880
will care

746
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,279
more about it clarifying expectations

747
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,520
so if we expect developers to follow

748
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,159
the secure coding guidelines then we get

749
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:45,120
an agreement

750
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,600
from their leadership that this is

751
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,880
what's going to happen

752
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,240
so we clarify expectations on both sides

753
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,279
if they want us to do something we

754
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,520
clarify that as well

755
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,799
accountability is also key so this means

756
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,919
that we keep

757
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,559
people accountable for the expectations

758
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,399
and the commitments

759
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,080
that were generated that were approved

760
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,799
so so this is something that that we

761
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,919
must do as well

762
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,360
and we keep ourselves accountable and my

763
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,720
personal favorite is no fear

764
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,000
knows uncertainty and no doubt i

765
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,120
feel that historically

766
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,919
security has always been something that

767
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,919
has been sold

768
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,320
to prevent something really bad from

769
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,360
happening

770
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,200
and for some people this can be very

771
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,520
scary and

772
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,480
for instance in trainings we can remove

773
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,840
all of that fear

774
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,360
all of that doubt and change that for

775
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,799
commitment for why in a

776
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,080
in a in a careful way not to make

777
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,360
anybody scared but just to understand

778
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,960
the situation

779
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,720
so no fear no thought essentially

780
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,080
and this is this directs the way

781
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,159
that we communicate within ourselves

782
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,159
and with everyone else in the company as

783
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,840
well

784
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,880
and this vulnerability so this is not

785
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,279
related to technical vulnerabilities

786
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,000
this is personal vulnerability for

787
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,039
instance

788
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,200
a lot of people especially non-technical

789
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,159
people

790
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,480
might feel that the security team is

791
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,440
absolutely

792
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,840
perfect and we don't make any mistakes

793
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,880
we never fall

794
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,520
for a scam or for everything we code

795
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,640
is secure 100 of the time

796
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,960
we might have that reputation of

797
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,120
maybe a little bit of perfection if we

798
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,960
want to call it that way

799
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,320
so if we allow ourselves to say hi

800
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,919
i made a mistake now or when i was

801
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,840
starting for instance

802
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,000
this can be key to help people up and up

803
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,120
with us

804
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,600
so the other day we had an event in the

805
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,279
company i work at

806
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,760
and i told the company that i had almost

807
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,200
had a security incident

808
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,159
back in the quarantine and i told this

809
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:12,720
story

810
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,200
with a bunch of memes people laughed

811
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,080
about it

812
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,880
and then after i finished that talk a

813
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,600
lot of people came to me and said hi

814
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,519
i made a mistake hi i almost got scammed

815
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,200
in the mall the other day

816
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,240
what should i do my

817
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,799
wife gave my credit card details to a

818
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,080
scammer

819
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,279
what should i do and so a lot of people

820
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,159
allow themselves to feel vulnerable with

821
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:40,720
me

822
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,159
because i took that initial step

823
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,640
and that made me look and everyone else

824
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,080
in the team as well

825
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,120
made us look more approachable and we

826
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,519
need to create that sense that that safe

827
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,799
space

828
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,919
because sometimes falling for a phishing

829
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,360
scam

830
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,880
coding or vulnerability or any any

831
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,000
security situation that might happen

832
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,080
can be just essentially a very stressful

833
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,279
experience

834
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,760
so then again if we allow ourselves to

835
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,440
be vulnerable

836
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,480
we help people feel a lot safer as well

837
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,600
and ultimately all of this

838
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,799
comes down to relationships empathy

839
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,360
and caring for everybody in their

840
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,600
organization

841
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,360
caring for everybody to have not only

842
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,760
a safe experience online for their

843
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,360
personal lives

844
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,559
but also that their actions lead

845
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,080
to a more safer space for our companies

846
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,159
as well

847
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,200
so that's on theirs on our side what

848
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,760
about

849
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,880
their side how do we help them

850
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,919
become the allies we need to have this

851
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,840
culture of trust

852
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,080
and the core of the matter is changing

853
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,240
the behavior

854
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,080
now you will have in your company you

855
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,760
likely already have allies

856
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,919
that care about security that know about

857
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,480
it are committed and engaged but maybe a

858
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,519
lot of people

859
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,840
doesn't have that yet so we must help

860
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,240
them change their behavior

861
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,519
and here i want to bring up

862
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,279
what the fbi does and especially in the

863
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,080
hostage

864
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,640
negotiation team there's a great book

865
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,000
about it

866
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,320
so back in the 90s the fbi was

867
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,240
going through a very difficult time

868
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,760
they were essentially losing all

869
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,799
negotiations and this led to a lot of

870
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,720
loss of lives and so the director

871
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,679
back in 1994 the fbi director assembled

872
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,840
a special team

873
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,440
whose only job was to figure out

874
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,240
what's what's wrong with the way that we

875
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,760
negotiate

876
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,200
and how can we negotiate in a way that

877
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,760
actually

878
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,840
changes the behavior of the criminal on

879
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,200
site

880
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,480
and helped us save lives and this was a

881
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,280
special

882
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,719
unit that had people that dealt with

883
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,560
crisis management incident response

884
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,000
behavioral sciences psychology

885
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,560
anything that was needed to fix this

886
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,918
problem

887
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,320
so this team went and did a lot of

888
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,440
research

889
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,079
a lot of experimentation a lot of

890
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:30,960
learning

891
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,040
they contacted harvard they contacted

892
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
the best minds they could

893
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,918
and one of the things i found was the

894
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,040
research

895
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,000
that was done back in the 80s few years

896
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,199
before

897
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,199
by daniel kahneman that said

898
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,399
that essentially people are irrational

899
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,280
beings

900
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,480
so back then in the 80s

901
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,719
the the economic sciences thought that

902
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,920
people do things

903
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,240
because it's the right thing to do

904
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,800
because it's cheaper because it's

905
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,920
rationally better but in reality what

906
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,640
was found

907
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,079
is that we do things because of how they

908
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,040
feel

909
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,640
so we feel before we think

910
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,560
and feeling is a way of thinking

911
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,720
and the way ganimat explains it is that

912
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
we have system one

913
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,560
which is the emotional irrational beast

914
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,320
side of our minds and we have system two

915
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,960
which is the logical rational

916
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,000
side of our minds and whenever something

917
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,119
happens

918
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,119
question uh uh and a stimulus in the

919
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,560
environment

920
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,280
we first process this through system 1

921
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,839
and then

922
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,839
that response informs our system 2

923
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,280
response

924
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,880
so this means that if we want to change

925
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,320
the behavior of anybody a criminal

926
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,680
a terrorist a person

927
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,720
then we first must appeal to emotion

928
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,400
rather than to rational thinking

929
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,200
and this is the mistake that the fbi was

930
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,480
making before

931
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,720
because they used to see negotiation as

932
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,960
a problem-solving thing

933
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,599
fully rational and that's why it didn't

934
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,560
work

935
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,000
a hostage situation was extremely

936
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,880
emotional and especially everything else

937
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,720
is as well

938
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,800
and so after they they found this

939
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,240
research they came up with

940
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,280
what is today called the fbi

941
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,200
stairway model for behavior change

942
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,960
and so whenever there's a hostage

943
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,480
negotiation

944
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,560
no matter the type no matter how

945
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,240
dangerous

946
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,960
an expert negotiator from the fb guy

947
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,560
goes

948
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,680
and essentially establishes trust with

949
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,599
the criminal

950
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,680
and first the first thing that they do

951
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,480
is that they actively listen to them

952
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,000
they want to understand why they're

953
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,480
doing

954
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,079
what they're doing without asking them

955
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,400
why just using

956
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,240
what and how questions they want to make

957
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,359
the criminal feel heard first then they

958
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,640
employ what they call

959
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,839
tactical empathy which is like empathy

960
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:26,960
on steroids

961
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,400
they mirror what the other person is

962
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,040
feeling

963
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,560
they label it they manage to understand

964
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,280
the criminal as much as possible they

965
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,720
build rapport

966
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,000
they become not friends but they have

967
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,560
the established relationship

968
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,320
after they have all of this that

969
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,839
influence the behavior

970
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,599
of the criminal to get them to see

971
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,800
things as they see it and this

972
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,599
ultimately leads to behavior change

973
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,200
the reason why i'm bringing this up in

974
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,119
this talk is because

975
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,119
this showcases that establishing trust

976
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,520
being able to be perceived as a

977
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,200
trustworthy person

978
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,200
an organization can ultimately lead to

979
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,720
behavior change

980
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,480
and if this works with hostage

981
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,839
and and crisis this way with terrorists

982
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,440
and with criminals

983
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,200
then we can use this to get anybody

984
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,240
to adopt our secure coding guidelines

985
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,280
to enable mfa to care about security we

986
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,480
can change

987
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,680
that perception and those behaviors by

988
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,960
establishing

989
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,000
and liberating trust

990
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,599
with people so it's a skill then again

991
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,920
it's actionable it's measurable

992
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,119
and it works in the field

993
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,599
and in general and it goes back to

994
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,480
listening

995
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,320
to empathy building reporters and

996
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,599
relationships influencing instead of

997
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,200
mandating change

998
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,760
and then ultimately using those

999
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,320
techniques to change the behavior

1000
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,520
so let's say that we manage to change

1001
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,240
the behavior

1002
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,760
of the person they now accept

1003
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,160
security they care about it it's part of

1004
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,400
them so so now we want to make it

1005
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,200
part of their identity so this means

1006
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,880
that they

1007
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,240
believe in security in a way so we talk

1008
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
in their language

1009
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,320
that means that whenever we explain the

1010
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,680
topic

1011
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,720
we we don't use this complicated jargon

1012
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,680
we have

1013
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,839
we don't talk to sales and marketing the

1014
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,160
same way we talk with engineering

1015
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,040
we help them understand our message we

1016
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,760
explain

1017
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,920
how does it benefit them in their

1018
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,440
professional lives

1019
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,680
in their personal lives because

1020
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,040
ultimately

1021
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,520
people do things for their reasons

1022
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,280
that's just the way it is

1023
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,839
and we use intrinsic motivation so

1024
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:02,960
purpose

1025
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,280
mastery and autonomy as much as we can

1026
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,359
and after this this it becomes part of

1027
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,119
their identity

1028
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,839
now what happens when we change the

1029
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:14,960
person behavior

1030
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,599
it's part of the identity they care as

1031
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,480
much as they can care about security

1032
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
what happens if their leadership does

1033
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,240
not value this

1034
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,440
so executives directors leaders

1035
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,079
must also be allies so they might have

1036
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,880
competing priorities say that security

1037
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,560
is not prioritized

1038
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,640
from a project management perspective

1039
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,680
and then they

1040
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,960
literally can do can do anything

1041
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,680
what are the price behaviors so is there

1042
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,280
a focus on shipping

1043
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,319
or is it a focus on shipping securely is

1044
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,079
security consider a quality

1045
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,240
metric in the organization and

1046
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,280
what support do they have do they have

1047
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,880
the time they need

1048
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,560
to learn security the learning resources

1049
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,680
the learning opportunities the support

1050
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,520
they need overall

1051
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,839
because security is not simple i would

1052
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:12,640
dare say

1053
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,079
and and we need to give people the space

1054
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,119
to adopt it to learn about it

1055
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,480
to interact with it

1056
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,760
and if they're leaders managers

1057
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,359
program managers executive directors

1058
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,000
if they don't value security then we

1059
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,599
must start at the top

1060
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,560
with that behavior change to help

1061
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,880
individual contributors

1062
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,400
behave securely as well and now

1063
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,760
say that we change behavior people

1064
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,599
care about security it's part of their

1065
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,960
identities

1066
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,720
we adopt we adapt our messages

1067
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,800
to their language something that they

1068
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,480
can understand

1069
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,599
and this is actually valued by the

1070
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,280
leadership in the company now we enhance

1071
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,119
their capabilities

1072
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,440
so this means training on a constant

1073
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,599
basis not just

1074
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,720
one hour annual training that

1075
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,000
we would dislike ourselves no this is

1076
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,920
a fun engaging training that happens

1077
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,720
multiple times a year we can have

1078
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,440
mentorship

1079
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,920
as well grab people from the security

1080
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,400
team and do one-on-ones

1081
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,319
or do one of many's lunch and learns

1082
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,480
uh ask me anything's gonna be very

1083
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,560
useful maybe we can grab leaders from

1084
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,119
the security organization

1085
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,000
to talk with people and what do they

1086
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,040
think

1087
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,480
we provide all the resources they need

1088
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,960
blogs books video trainings

1089
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,200
conferences even video youtube talks

1090
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,240
anything that might be needed and we

1091
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,760
have focus groups

1092
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
maybe we have a team of people that's

1093
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,160
working on

1094
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,200
completing x certification

1095
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,359
we have our security champions with a

1096
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,319
special

1097
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,200
learning path security ambassadors with

1098
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,599
another learning path

1099
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,040
we we do our best to

1100
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,160
help everyone in the company grow

1101
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,720
in their security journey throughout the

1102
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,280
year

1103
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,599
on a permanent basis and so

1104
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,119
we have all of this but at the same time

1105
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,800
i want to make a not a warning

1106
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,480
but but also add this as well

1107
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,280
so we want to extend trust we see that

1108
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,160
trust

1109
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,720
is the one thing that changes company

1110
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,599
fool

1111
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,800
to become company bar it's a way that we

1112
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,480
can leverage people and take the

1113
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,720
opportunity they represent

1114
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,960
to make the internet safer but at the

1115
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
same time we have to extend trust

1116
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,240
in a smart way with judgment this

1117
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,680
doesn't mean

1118
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,640
that we extend trust blindly that we

1119
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,680
just

1120
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,400
trust everybody and trust that everybody

1121
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,200
will define

1122
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,400
and have no controls no

1123
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,760
we must always have judgment as well so

1124
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,560
this is like adding another layer in our

1125
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,079
security program

1126
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,520
we still have our detection and response

1127
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,359
our logging our serious trust mechanisms

1128
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,400
our processes policies

1129
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,440
we still have all of this what i mean

1130
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,520
by all of these stocks and all of these

1131
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,520
behaviors is that

1132
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,640
we have a high propensity to trust

1133
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,280
that means that we don't go around

1134
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:45,839
without

1135
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,920
extending trust anybody or distrusting

1136
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,160
every single person we see

1137
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,640
thinking that they're just human error

1138
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,319
waiting to happen

1139
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,200
that's what i mean by this we can change

1140
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,800
our perspective we have

1141
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,240
on people to help them

1142
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,280
become the best they can be and to turn

1143
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,760
them

1144
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,200
into another layer in our

1145
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,400
security program with judgment

1146
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,800
in a smart way so with this

1147
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,119
we we have these two pillars to wrap

1148
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:22,720
things up

1149
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,560
we on one side the security organization

1150
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,040
is trustworthy it's people-centric

1151
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,160
we influence people we seek mutual

1152
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:34,960
benefit

1153
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,319
so we want win-win mindset

1154
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,920
on another side we have everyone else in

1155
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,040
the company

1156
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,599
who are allies to the security program

1157
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,280
they are knowledgeable because we've

1158
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,640
trained them with

1159
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,760
everything they need they are committed

1160
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,160
because we change their behaviors we

1161
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,319
change their perspective

1162
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,280
and security is part of their identity

1163
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,240
they're engaged

1164
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,359
because we're not scary we're not

1165
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,960
we're not intimidating we're fun we are

1166
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,280
engaging we are seen we participate

1167
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,599
we are part of the company and they are

1168
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:16,640
responsible

1169
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,119
because they care about security and

1170
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,560
they also have

1171
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,359
all the support they need from their

1172
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,040
management chain

1173
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,480
and with these two things and

1174
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,880
all the things we can add on top of this

1175
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,200
i believe that we can have

1176
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,599
a security culture of trust that

1177
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,599
actually drives behavior

1178
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,839
and makes the internet safer and so

1179
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,079
hopefully

1180
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,800
if they have if this happens then maybe

1181
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,839
next time

1182
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,359
you see this picture maybe you might not

1183
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:50,000
see

1184
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,480
inside their threads and phishing people

1185
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,839
that click confusion links

1186
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,000
or engineers that are conflicting

1187
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,760
and that code insecurely that don't fix

1188
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,200
anything

1189
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,800
you see trouble overall hopefully

1190
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,599
if this happens that's not what you see

1191
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,880
you see an opportunity

1192
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,000
that was taken and you see

1193
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,880
people that you trust that also trust

1194
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,079
you back

1195
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,480
and with this a security culture of

1196
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,599
trust

1197
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,160
