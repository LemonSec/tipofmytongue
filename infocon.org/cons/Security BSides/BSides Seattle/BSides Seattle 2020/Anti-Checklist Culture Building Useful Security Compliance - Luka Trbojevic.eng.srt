00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,640
[Music]

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,440
cool well

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,080
thanks everybody uh for taking the time

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,800
to uh

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
join me today um so today we're gonna be

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,279
kind of walking the road map of building

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,240
a useful

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,880
security compliance program uh from

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,880
absolutely nothing so we're gonna start

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,519
with

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,080
an absolutely blank page you get hired

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,439
into a company

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,960
there's absolutely nothing there and

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,320
we're going to kind of walk through the

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,558
process of what it looks like to go from

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,200
you have absolutely nothing to

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,840
eventually external audit and then

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,840
what you what you do from there and then

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,680
before we get going i just want to give

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,399
a huge thank you for everybody who's uh

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,600
joining us today everyone who's

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,160
participated uh in the conference uh

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,960
all the organizers sponsors um putting

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,079
something like this together

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
is not easy um and uh you know

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,199
folks doing this to make the conference

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,199
happen despite the circumstances

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,440
uh is really awesome and everyone

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,879
involved is awesome so

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,720
thank you so much so

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,280
a little bit about me uh i'm on the grc

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,720
team at hashicorp right now

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
um and so helping build out the the

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,479
security compliance program there

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,560
and then before that i was at get lab

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
and i joined i think i was employee 450

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,400
something

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
and in that year or something that i was

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
there we about tripled in size and we

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,680
built the program from

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,320
absolutely nothing and then ended up

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,200
getting uh

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,840
that external audit that we wanted um

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,200
and then before that i was working

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,799
mostly startups and

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,119
build a few security and compliance

47
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,040
programs usually a mix

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,079
often as higher number one for for

49
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,600
security and compliance

50
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,680
um and then before that i i did a whole

51
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,960
bunch of things i

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,040
uh worked in a lab for a little bit did

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,680
a couple of research internships i did

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,720
bug bounties on the side and i

55
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,360
uh way way back when hosted uh websites

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,960
and game servers so i've i've kind of

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,360
gone all over and i found myself in grc

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
to bring kind of that

59
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,759
technical perspective and um you know i

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,759
just i enjoy putting the pieces together

61
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:08,080
and

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,479
working with with people so it ended up

63
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,040
being a good fit

64
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,920
so it usually helps me to understand why

65
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,599
is somebody talking about something

66
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,120
what's the motivation

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,440
um and so about a year and a half ago

68
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,800
when i was at get lab

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,879
i put out this video about soft to

70
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,080
compliance

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,080
and the the reception was really really

72
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
good i had a lot of people reach out

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
there was a lot of curiosity about this

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,080
stuff and um

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,400
i kind of started putting out more

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,000
content and found that there was a need

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
for it

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,440
and um this

79
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,200
i feel like there's a huge need for this

80
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,720
but all of the content

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,040
our consultancies and vendors trying to

82
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
sell you things and it's really hard to

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,879
get actual information um and so i

84
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,560
wanted to put something out there

85
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,640
selfishly that anybody can reference

86
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,239
keep it open source pull it up on

87
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,680
youtube and be able to kind of

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
walk this road map and then who's this

89
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,760
for absolutely anyone who's interested

90
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,519
but it's mostly focused on

91
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,360
uh the practitioner who will actually be

92
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,959
doing this stuff

93
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,280
managers who need to maybe build a team

94
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,159
or

95
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,319
are going into grc for the first time

96
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,680
and also

97
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,720
leaders and startup founders who kind of

98
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,560
want to get a sense for what's out there

99
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,239
and what are some of the approaches

100
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,040
for doing this stuff

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,120
so i think it's important to talk a

102
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,879
little bit about what is security

103
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,720
compliance and what it isn't and so kind

104
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,480
of the the top level points here are

105
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:34,959
that

106
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,959
um people are buying your stuff and

107
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,280
you're one of hundreds if not thousands

108
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
that come through the vendor process per

109
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,879
year and

110
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,200
security compliance is a risk reduction

111
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,440
function but not for you but for

112
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,640
other companies um it's also it's also a

113
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,799
way for you to get resources

114
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,720
um that are devoted to doing this thing

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,159
you need to do anyway

116
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,920
but getting all of your engineering

117
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
security and product friends on board

118
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,400
that

119
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
that ship so that they can build and

120
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,640
deliver things they otherwise would but

121
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
that aren't being prioritized

122
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,480
um and it it's also a pragmatic approach

123
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:10,959
to

124
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,760
doing external audit so it gives you a

125
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,480
good

126
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,079
framework it gives you this program

127
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,478
level view of of being able to go from

128
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,079
nothing to external audit

129
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,639
and you might be regulated um you know

130
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,320
you need to if you're like a healthcare

131
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,440
startup

132
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,240
you need to sign a baa business

133
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,520
associate agreement

134
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
um stating that you're doing these

135
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
things um or maybe you're

136
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
in like communications and you have the

137
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,919
telephone consumer protection act

138
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,360
um and so you need to align with these

139
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
regulations and this kind of gives you a

140
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,800
framework to to go about doing that

141
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
so i want to talk a little bit first

142
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,560
before we get started about some of the

143
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,280
problems

144
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,840
um with the current practices and and

145
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,639
the grc

146
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,199
slash security compliance industry as a

147
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,400
whole

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,040
and so this was an interesting um post

149
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
that came on my feed on

150
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,720
linkedin and so the the point dallas is

151
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,400
essentially making is that

152
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
if you talk to somebody in finance or

153
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,600
healthcare um

154
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,280
everyone seems to have these really

155
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,360
special rigid requirements

156
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
um and at the end of the day it's kind

157
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,240
of all just security basics but

158
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,479
talked about and packaged in a different

159
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,600
way

160
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,360
and so i responded essentially making

161
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,479
the point that

162
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,800
yeah i completely agree with you and i

163
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,160
think the reason is

164
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
a basic requirement like segment your

165
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,320
network and d provision users becomes

166
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,039
really really really incredibly special

167
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,440
um

168
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,919
after um maybe the legal team or

169
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,280
auditors or

170
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,080
um maybe your own internal grc team put

171
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,000
together this like really rigid

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,280
checklist that you have to go through

173
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,880
and everything becomes

174
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,280
a special requirement and that's that

175
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,080
that's that's

176
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,919
the essence of what this talk is about

177
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,560
is that checklist doesn't need to be

178
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
so rigid and and everything doesn't need

179
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,000
to be

180
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
here's a list of controls please deliver

181
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,199
for me right now

182
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,880
there's there's i think a better way to

183
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,800
do it a more holistic

184
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,759
people-friendly approach to doing that

185
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,400
so

186
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
the tldr of all of that is that you know

187
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,680
security ad

188
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,000
compliance at its core is um and i'm

189
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
sure many of you uh have experienced

190
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,639
this

191
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,080
it's very very rigid you often get told

192
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,919
these are the requirements you have to

193
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,759
deliver on exactly this

194
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,400
um and you know from the practitioner

195
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,919
view i see a lot that

196
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,039
these practices and and the way we

197
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,199
do controls is often considered

198
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,039
immutable you've seen it once done this

199
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,960
way and that's how you carry it for the

200
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,160
rest of your career

201
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,919
but it absolutely isn't it doesn't have

202
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,440
to be rigid and it's not immutable

203
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,319
so you get hired into a company and this

204
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,680
is what you see there's literally

205
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,000
nothing

206
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,039
you have no policies no controls um

207
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,680
and then ceo or your director whoever

208
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,400
says

209
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,319
build me a security compliance program

210
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,080
so that's what this talk is about

211
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,240
and so let's start with that absolute

212
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,319
blank page

213
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,960
so the first thing i like to do um when

214
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,919
i get hired on

215
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,759
for a role like this building a program

216
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,759
is you have to get to know the people

217
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,639
you have to talk to

218
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,800
absolutely everybody you have to figure

219
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,479
out what are the things that you're

220
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,240
actually doing today

221
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
um why are you doing it that way you

222
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,720
have to ask for documentation and show a

223
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,400
genuine key in interest

224
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,280
and like what's going on right um you

225
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,960
have to really understand your

226
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,840
environment

227
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,919
like what cloud assets do you use do you

228
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,319
just use aws or do you also use

229
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,120
um you know azure or whatever um and you

230
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,240
have to let them know

231
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,639
uh who you are why you were hired what

232
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,360
you're doing

233
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,880
and why you're doing it that's so

234
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,720
important you have to tell people like

235
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,479
why are we doing this what's the goal of

236
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,800
all of it

237
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
so from the very beginning with the

238
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,039
blank page there are a couple of

239
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,720
there are three main things that you

240
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,400
have to do you have to get your policies

241
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,919
in place i know everyone's really

242
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,120
excited about policies

243
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,440
um i can sense the excitement here um

244
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,639
and and that's just

245
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,319
in essence the fancy way of saying it's

246
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,919
a high level description of

247
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,360
what you're doing and what people should

248
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
be doing um and

249
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,680
i i like to include uh you know the

250
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,520
scoring rubrics for like risk management

251
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,080
and whatever

252
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,560
in slas but you can obviously move that

253
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,160
to process docs if you want

254
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,599
um and then you have your controls and

255
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,680
controls is just a fancy way of saying

256
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,720
um it's a logical framework for

257
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,879
mapping activities you do to your

258
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,560
regulations and policies and it just

259
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,199
makes things

260
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,720
easier to work with so when people say

261
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,639
controls that's what they mean

262
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,399
and then the third step in all that is

263
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,479
uh the gap assessment and that's a fancy

264
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,080
way

265
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,240
of saying we need to figure out what

266
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,440
you're actually doing now

267
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,679
and whether it's what you actually need

268
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,599
given the the controls and your

269
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,480
requirements and stuff like that

270
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,959
so the first part is is um uh policies

271
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:49,760
so let's kind of

272
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
walk through if i come into a company

273
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,360
and there's absolutely nothing there how

274
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,399
do you

275
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,160
with this useful security compliance

276
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
program how do you build out the

277
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,399
policies with absolutely nothing

278
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
my preference is always start with a

279
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,040
template and so i give two specific

280
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,120
examples and these are completely free

281
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,440
and open source and you can go to each

282
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,959
of these and you can put them pull it

283
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,800
put in a pr on github if you want to

284
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,080
change them

285
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,839
but there are a couple of resources like

286
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,000
these i highlight the jupiter one

287
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,839
uh policy templates and they also have

288
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,600
some nice mappings to controls and stuff

289
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,240
like that

290
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,760
and then you have like strong dm has

291
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,920
their comply thing which is a

292
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,120
fun tool um and and with policies the

293
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,240
way i see it is

294
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,200
the ultimate policy leaves your typical

295
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,160
um

296
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,320
you know employee contractor or whoever

297
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
knowing what you're actually doing and

298
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,480
why

299
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,080
and so i'm sure all of you have had that

300
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
experience you open up a policy

301
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,760
you have absolutely no idea what's going

302
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,279
on by the time you're done with it

303
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,160
and so that's the benchmark and and that

304
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,360
that's what i like to see is the

305
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,880
benchmark for making

306
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,360
useful policies somebody without any

307
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
background going in and actually

308
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,680
understanding

309
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,000
what you're doing and why um and of

310
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,839
course you know for audit time you can't

311
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,920
forget your rubrics and slas um

312
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,519
because you will get asked okay where's

313
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,880
your risk scoring rubric and you can

314
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,480
maybe have it in a process doc but

315
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
wherever you put it just don't forget um

316
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,600
your slas

317
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,880
and we'll talk more about that too

318
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
um and and it's it really is as simple

319
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,079
as pick a set you

320
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,240
you actually like and so some people

321
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,320
prefer comply some people prefer jupiter

322
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,920
one some people prefer

323
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,360
you know whatever else there are a bunch

324
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,279
of free policies out there um

325
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,360
make it pick whichever one's the

326
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,320
simplest

327
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,240
most convenient and kind of go from

328
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,120
there and go do a quick review

329
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,560
based on your conversations with

330
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,399
everyone

331
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,000
are they relevant if they're not make

332
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
some basic changes to kind of align with

333
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,720
your doing

334
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,800
and then set them aside for now and so

335
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
in about a week to a month you can have

336
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,160
a whole set of policies

337
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,800
for absolutely free it was really easy

338
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,160
and you can go through make them

339
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,040
relevant for

340
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,440
for you know in like two days or

341
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,760
whatever it takes

342
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,839
so the second part of them now that we

343
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,519
put policies aside we've tabled them

344
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,720
just for now

345
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,480
are the controls and so again it's just

346
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,079
a fancy way of saying you're mapping

347
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,120
logically these

348
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
different activities you're doing across

349
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
your company and

350
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,399
it's an easy way to track things so

351
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,959
um if you've been part of the grc

352
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,519
function

353
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,000
or um you know you've worked with grc

354
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,200
team or audit team

355
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
um everyone's always talking about

356
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,480
controls give me your wrist control

357
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,079
matrix you know show me

358
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,040
what are your controls um and so why all

359
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
the fuss um

360
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
it essentially just describes what you

361
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,920
do and it maps it back to the

362
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,800
requirements

363
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
so that you can uh do something once for

364
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,079
it to meet

365
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,160
a bunch of requirements um and for you

366
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
to be able to collect evidence easy

367
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,839
right so if you know that like this

368
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,440
requirement maps to

369
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,760
control one two and three it's just an

370
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
easy way for you to logically

371
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,399
keep track of what's going on um so

372
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,160
these are really important they're very

373
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,880
often done

374
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,360
very wrong they're often very confusing

375
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,000
and we'll we'll

376
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,920
actually talk more about that and how to

377
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,240
avoid that

378
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,160
so you you um you're finished your

379
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,839
policies you had this template and you

380
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:04,639
said all right

381
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,079
i have uh my policies now that was easy

382
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,320
but now controls this sounds like a lot

383
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
of effort this is really elaborate i

384
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
have no idea how to start

385
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,040
how do i do it and so um my general

386
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,079
recommendation

387
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,160
is go to something like the adobe

388
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,079
control framework again it's free

389
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,320
completely open source all of you can go

390
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,680
and download it today

391
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,320
um and it's essentially uh an easily

392
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,399
customizable thing that maps to

393
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,639
everything right so maps to fedramp

394
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,720
taylor to sock2 pci

395
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,920
iso and so rather than spending months

396
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,200
building out your own thing you can

397
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,079
download this

398
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,240
move it to a spreadsheet and have uh

399
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,000
your own control framework you can even

400
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
give it a fancy name and say like this

401
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,000
is

402
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,920
this is you know my org control

403
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,120
framework um

404
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,720
which it's great internal marketing

405
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,160
so what does that look like um so uh

406
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,720
this is the pdf version and i source

407
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,240
this down below with the link

408
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,920
but essentially it breaks everything

409
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
down into control families it tells you

410
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,440
all of the things that you need to do

411
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,920
for any particular framework and so it's

412
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,760
really easy it's a single pane of glass

413
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
to see what are the things that you do

414
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,279
that you need to do to meet these

415
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,120
requirements and it's

416
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,399
it's great so you can go through and

417
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,639
they have instructions for how you can

418
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,079
you know customize this so like you

419
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,480
change the organizations to like

420
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,880
whatever your organization is um and

421
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,480
then you can filter by

422
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,920
um the different frameworks so if you

423
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,480
don't need iso you just want soft too

424
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,399
you can just filter everything else out

425
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
so it's really really handy

426
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,079
easy to work with so um how do you

427
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:38,720
actually

428
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,240
work with this stuff though i get this

429
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,079
question a lot does it need to be in

430
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,000
like a fancy grc tool

431
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,160
that you're paying 10 000 a month for

432
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,519
does it like is there anything

433
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,639
particularly have to do

434
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,519
an answer is absolutely not you can just

435
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,440
move all of this into a spreadsheet

436
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,600
i personally prefer markdown files

437
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
because

438
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,760
i prefer markdown files but you can put

439
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,079
them

440
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,079
wherever you want copy and paste into a

441
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,320
spreadsheet that's totally fine

442
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,399
um and then like i said you just go

443
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,320
through it and and the actual mechanical

444
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,920
things you do to get this set up

445
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,079
is filter out any framework uh any

446
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,519
frameworks you don't need

447
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,279
and if there's something that clearly

448
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,360
just doesn't apply to you

449
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,040
don't make the case to include it just

450
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,639
remove it so if you're a cloud native

451
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,839
company

452
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
and you're using aws or whatever

453
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,199
clearly you don't need to have physical

454
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,959
access controls for your data center

455
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,079
because you don't have them

456
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,600
you know what you tell auditors come on

457
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,000
a time yeah we rely on them here

458
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
here's you know there's the they have

459
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,199
their soft to report and let's inherit

460
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,160
those controls

461
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,399
um and that's it um and then just follow

462
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,920
their instructions to set it up

463
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,160
so you can do all of this probably

464
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,440
within a week

465
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,720
a month if you want to be really

466
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,600
elaborate with it

467
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,000
so now that you have sort of that

468
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,079
logical framework set up uh it's time

469
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,079
for the gap assessment so if you open

470
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,399
any like security compliance job listing

471
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,480
everyone is all about the gap assessment

472
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,320
um and this is the really important part

473
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,680
now that you've kind of logically

474
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,639
figured out

475
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,320
um some of this stuff you actually have

476
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,880
to um see what's in practice you need to

477
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,320
see what you're doing

478
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,440
and whether it's what you need to do

479
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,000
so in general people people make a big

480
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,160
fuss about gap assessments but i

481
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,639
i think it's it it doesn't need to be

482
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,040
that complicated so i like to break gap

483
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,120
assessments into three parts and i know

484
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,399
there's some disagreement in the

485
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,480
industry about this but um

486
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,040
for the very first part and it looks

487
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,959
like my numbering is completely wrong

488
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,160
but they're all number one because

489
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
they're all equally important um

490
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,000
is that each framework requirement you

491
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
have to make sure that the controls

492
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,920
that map back to it actually meet the

493
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,839
requirement and what happens is

494
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,240
um often times these control frameworks

495
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,120
will be really

496
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,160
broad um and these companies that make

497
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,240
it will have this stuff in their policy

498
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
and it might if you're using the control

499
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,600
as a basis for

500
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,519
you know deciding what you need to do

501
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,120
you need to make sure

502
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,959
that they address everything in the

503
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,959
requirement and then the second part

504
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,440
is part two is you need to compare all

505
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,120
those controls once you know they meet

506
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,720
the requirement but it's so important

507
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,759
you need to know

508
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,279
that the controls you're working with

509
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,120
actually meet the requirement because

510
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,279
this will bite you later i've seen it so

511
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,079
many times

512
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,920
you need to do that first part but after

513
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,600
you've done it you kind of run through

514
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,199
your policies and make sure that there's

515
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,000
like one sentence per control saying we

516
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,560
we do this thing or you know like the

517
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
general theme of what's going on

518
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,399
and then the third part is you have to

519
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,759
go through each control

520
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,920
now that you've established the um

521
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,079
validity of your control framework

522
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,000
you have to ask yourself do we actually

523
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,160
do that thing

524
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,920
so um let's let's walk through this

525
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,000
first part really quick um

526
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
making sure that the controls actually

527
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,040
meet the requirement again

528
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,959
this part is so important it's gonna if

529
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,560
you do this this is gonna save

530
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,920
so much effort down the road

531
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,360
so here we have fun requirement 3.1

532
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,079
and it maps to exciting controls one two

533
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,360
three

534
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,000
and what you're going to do is you're

535
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,640
going to read

536
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,119
fun requirement 3.1 and this might be

537
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,400
soft to or iso

538
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,760
and then you're going to say all right

539
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,919
exciting control 1

540
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,679
says to do this thing that meets this

541
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,119
part of the requirement

542
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,039
you'll do the same for exciting control

543
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,559
two and three

544
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,400
and and that's it right that that's the

545
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
entire process you'll then go through

546
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,400
this

547
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,720
and you'll do this for every requirement

548
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,000
um and and

549
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,160
uh whenever there's a gap you'll note it

550
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,440
maybe you'll fix it

551
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,559
um and uh it really is that simple you

552
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,160
can do it in a spreadsheet you can

553
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,919
do it in a google doc totally up to you

554
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,320
so then the second part is um comparing

555
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,840
your controls with the policies

556
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,880
and and again this is really as simple

557
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
as it sounds you have your exciting

558
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
controls one two and three

559
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,080
they're part of this exciting control

560
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,559
family one and what happens is

561
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,919
you're gonna read the policy and you're

562
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,760
gonna make sure there's a policy

563
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,919
answer to every one of these activities

564
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,480
that you're eventually gonna say you do

565
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,200
and so usually a sentence or two about

566
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,080
controls

567
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,880
one two three is enough but it really

568
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,840
helps to keep it simple

569
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,160
and then the third part of this is going

570
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,440
through each control

571
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,520
and asking yourself whether you actually

572
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,360
do this and so this is a pain point

573
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,320
and mistake i see all the time is when

574
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,000
you do gap assessments you kind of just

575
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
use your head and then you say okay we

576
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
do this and we don't do that

577
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,039
and you don't document any of it and you

578
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,120
don't test any of it so what happens is

579
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,320
come audit time

580
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,240
you find out oh we don't actually do

581
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,000
this thing there's no documentation for

582
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,559
that

583
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,080
and if you've been like on an

584
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,600
engineering team or you've gone through

585
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,160
audit

586
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,320
and then very last minute security

587
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,760
compliance comes and says

588
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,440
hey we need you to build out all this

589
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,200
documentation and start doing this brand

590
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,160
new process

591
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,360
you have like three days please do it um

592
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,840
this is why right so as you're doing

593
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,360
this testing the first question you

594
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,960
always have to ask is is this even

595
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
applicable and so we talked a little bit

596
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,400
about that earlier

597
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
um and then you know do you do you

598
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,679
actually need to do it a lot of these

599
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,200
controls won't be applicable to what

600
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,080
you're doing

601
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,559
um and it's a it's okay to scope some of

602
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,840
these out

603
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,600
you have to ask yourself is it actually

604
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
documented is this written somewhere is

605
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:11,919
it

606
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,919
you know living in somebody's head are

607
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,520
there defined slas

608
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,720
roles responsibilities um and and who

609
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,120
owns it somebody has to own this process

610
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,080
document all of these things and ask all

611
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,919
the right questions and do that for each

612
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,640
of your controls

613
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,679
um the kind of the top level point there

614
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,320
is

615
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,760
anybody who goes through your gap

616
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,320
assessment should know exactly what you

617
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,799
saw

618
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,640
and why you made your determination and

619
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,080
so a

620
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,000
persistent problem i see in the security

621
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
compliance space is when you generate

622
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,640
a work product like this you give it to

623
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,919
anybody

624
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,919
nobody has any idea what's going on and

625
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,760
it's a huge liability for engineering

626
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,120
teams that have to work with you

627
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,799
because they have no idea how you came

628
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,480
to this conclusion

629
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,400
and it's a liability for the rest of the

630
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
security and compliance team because

631
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
they have no idea how you came to this

632
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,240
conclusion so every single thing that

633
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,320
you sample every policy that you make a

634
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,520
determination on

635
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,280
you have to document that and this can

636
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
be in a spreadsheet google doc

637
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,919
markdown file whatever those are details

638
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,799
that don't really matter

639
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,760
um and so you will have gaps i mean if

640
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,000
you're

641
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,520
coming in and there's nothing you will

642
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,600
have gaps and the

643
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,200
where a program becomes useful or not is

644
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,640
what you do with those gaps

645
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,480
so i want to revisit this slide because

646
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,559
this is so so important the second point

647
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,360
that i've i've

648
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,880
um bolted out um you know

649
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,799
it's security compliance is essentially

650
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,440
a nice way for you to get the things

651
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,000
that you

652
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
want and that you otherwise would do but

653
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,440
that there isn't business

654
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,559
justification for um and

655
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,559
at this point when you have these gaps

656
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,720
this is literally the best time

657
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
for you to go to your security teams go

658
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,559
to your infrastructure teams go to

659
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,520
all these people and say hey look um we

660
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,200
now have an opportunity to build out

661
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,720
some of these things that you want to do

662
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,799
and and we have business support to do

663
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,879
it

664
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,360
but before you go to these control

665
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,720
owners and you start talking about

666
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,760
remediation

667
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,280
again you need to go through those steps

668
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,600
so what is absolutely required

669
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
what needs to be done in a very specific

670
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,799
way what doesn't

671
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,200
is it flexible and if so how flexible is

672
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,440
it what is the exact scope you're

673
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,880
talking about

674
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,520
and so a useful security compliance

675
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,240
program

676
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,679
uh will give people very specific bars

677
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,720
and and measurements and they'll know

678
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
exactly how far they can go

679
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,600
what is malleable and what isn't

680
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,280
so you go to the control owner and you

681
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,960
have this conversation i'm sure many of

682
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,679
you have had

683
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,679
if if you're on engineering or security

684
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,280
or whatever and you've talked to

685
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,760
um the grc folks that are getting ready

686
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,559
for audit

687
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,760
um and um you

688
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,919
you know they they kind of give you this

689
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,600
list of controls that need to be done

690
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,200
and nobody really knows what's

691
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,960
why it needs to be done that way or is

692
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,280
this flexible is it or is it not

693
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,039
um and so when you go to control owners

694
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,720
as the practitioner again

695
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,400
go through that list what's required

696
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,480
what's not how flexible exactly

697
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,320
where's that bar and maybe there are

698
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,840
like one or two people who have been in

699
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,960
audit with me

700
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,000
um on this on this um

701
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,480
you know in this talk i'm always harping

702
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,320
on this exactly where is the bar

703
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,240
people need to know how much they can

704
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,480
move how much creativity they can have

705
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,679
um and ask the questions like is this

706
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,320
something

707
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,000
you know are you otherwise planning to

708
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,080
do something that aligns with this

709
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,679
and it you know these audit preps can be

710
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,840
a resource magnet and then you can say

711
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,400
okay you were planning on deploying this

712
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,320
elaborate logging pipeline there wasn't

713
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,880
enough

714
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,760
business support this aligns with all of

715
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,280
these things we need to do

716
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,120
let's do it let's make the business case

717
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,640
for it um and then

718
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,360
another question is you know is there a

719
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:01,840
way to

720
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,200
automate this um so it's so important to

721
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,240
tell people

722
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,360
here is what our end outcome is

723
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,440
do you see a way instead of doing this

724
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,600
manually to automate this or if maybe

725
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,799
you're technical yourself

726
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,480
you can propose your own automation

727
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,960
solution

728
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,360
i think probably the most important

729
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,840
thing and and a huge mistake

730
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,000
made in security compliance programs is

731
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,960
that um

732
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,840
you give them this immutable list um

733
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,720
that uh

734
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,240
you know is based off of things you've

735
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,000
seen before and

736
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,200
you say please deliver and you you

737
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,120
you know you say just add it to your

738
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,400
sprint and get it done

739
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,080
but the bottom line is you have to let

740
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,600
the smes be smes

741
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,000
if they don't know what you're doing and

742
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,720
where the bar

743
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,960
is and um and

744
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,320
they if they don't know where the bar is

745
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,880
and and what you're trying to do then

746
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,480
even with that immutable list they can't

747
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,159
get you exactly what you want

748
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,679
and so the better solution is

749
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,240
tell them exactly where the bar is and

750
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
then let them be the smes for their own

751
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,919
systems and their own development

752
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,640
and so there are gaps too with with the

753
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,679
things you do

754
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,520
right so these are the processes that

755
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
you do you have risk management

756
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,760
vendor reviews access reviews all of

757
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,559
that stuff

758
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,600
and so these are an important group of

759
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,960
gaps that

760
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,400
are really can be a pain for teams

761
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,240
so the point the first point is that

762
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,640
absolutely nobody likes security theater

763
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,400
absolutely everybody can sense it i'm

764
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,240
sure many of you um

765
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,080
you know uh who are here today or

766
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,520
watching this video later

767
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,880
um have seen it um

768
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,720
everybody can sense it absolutely

769
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
everybody can sense it and so

770
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,840
um you have to be very very cautious

771
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,400
to play along with it you know it's

772
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,480
never your mission to defend

773
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,799
bad requirements or outdated frameworks

774
00:24:58,799 --> 00:24:59,679
and i see this

775
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,000
time and time again you don't need to

776
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,720
justify

777
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,240
what you're doing with this is the

778
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,760
basics of security

779
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,679
sometimes it's a bad requirement and it

780
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,880
makes no sense

781
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,600
and it's totally legitimate for you to

782
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,320
say

783
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
i totally get it this is just one of the

784
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,840
things they're asking for

785
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,159
um and let's make it as painless as

786
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,480
possible

787
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,320
so the second point with with these

788
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,159
these process gaps that you see

789
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,960
is um filling the void with jargon in

790
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,000
words and so

791
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,679
this kind of goes back to the policies

792
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,480
and the controls and how you wrote them

793
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,760
and the solution to that is you know

794
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,960
everything you do every process that you

795
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,360
help build and implement doesn't need to

796
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,400
sound like this

797
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,279
superhero right um is simple and to the

798
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,000
point is

799
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,679
is always uh more effective than not

800
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,840
so you know one example for risk

801
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,880
assessments for

802
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,000
is um you know your process for doing a

803
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,480
risk assessment is you open a google doc

804
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,159
you follow the mozilla rapid risk

805
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,919
assessment um process

806
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,320
and then you create a ticket in jira for

807
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,919
tracking remediation

808
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,480
um but what happens often is you copy

809
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,279
and paste

810
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,520
you know like the quarter of nist 830

811
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,400
which is the

812
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,159
risk management framework and then you

813
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,400
have a 20 page process doc describing

814
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,960
how you

815
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,120
create a google doc and then create a

816
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,320
jira ticket

817
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,640
and so keep everything really simple

818
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,600
avoid filling the words with jargon

819
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,400
it really only hurts understanding of

820
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,840
what you're doing and why

821
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
and it hurts your documentation in the

822
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,679
long run

823
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,159
the third point is um you know you have

824
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,279
to be

825
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,440
security compliance is an advisory role

826
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,480
at the end of the day

827
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,679
um we some

828
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,240
programs will try to mandate things very

829
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,120
rigidly

830
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,159
when it's absolutely not necessary and

831
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,000
so the solution for that is

832
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,919
look if you have an exceptions process

833
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,520
just use it right

834
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,080
um you you have this way out and when

835
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,919
things aren't going well or maybe

836
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,279
something doesn't make sense

837
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,320
just just use your exceptions process um

838
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,960
and you'll you'll have situations where

839
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,360
um

840
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,200
things will get in the way maybe one of

841
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,960
your change controls doesn't work

842
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,760
because

843
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,320
um you know there's no reviewer for a

844
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,600
pull request of

845
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,480
you know a non-critical repo because the

846
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,559
engineer lives in a different time zone

847
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,039
and

848
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,600
you know you can policy your way out of

849
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,960
these things

850
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,039
but a lot of teams don't do it and so a

851
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,880
useful security compliance program

852
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,039
will give people this exit hatch and a

853
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,200
way to get around some of these problems

854
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
while still meeting the requirements and

855
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,760
and um going through audit just fine

856
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,640
um and you also have to let people make

857
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,679
their own decisions

858
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,640
um and and let people own any risks that

859
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,240
they do take with maybe your audit

860
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,799
report gets tainted um

861
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,520
at one point you you have to not make it

862
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,159
your mission to make everything perfect

863
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,159
give people the the autonomy to make

864
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,440
their own decisions and

865
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,720
you know if it doesn't apply or make

866
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,360
sense use your exceptions process and

867
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,720
you can always do a risk assessment

868
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,279
saying

869
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,480
um hey look um you know this this

870
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,919
is very low risk for the company

871
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,080
uh the the fourth point on this is you

872
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,960
need to know your

873
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,000
your uh how your org size and maturity

874
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,120
and the solution to that is um if you're

875
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,799
a 500 person company

876
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,600
you don't need this massive enterprise

877
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
risk management thing

878
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,360
that nobody understands or can work with

879
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,799
right so you're trying to solve

880
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,200
problems and build direction for other

881
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,320
teams

882
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,039
that is commiserate with the current

883
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,200
size and level of maturity

884
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,840
of the org right and so you have to

885
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,799
crawl first

886
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,120
and then you walk and then you run but

887
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,960
also when you start running if you're

888
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,799
running with a weighted vest on in the

889
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,840
middle of summer

890
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,159
it's very very hard to do and there are

891
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,919
often times when you don't need to have

892
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:54,799
that vest on

893
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,799
and maybe you can run your marathon in

894
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,000
the winter right

895
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,960
so take all of that excess baggage away

896
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,240
and make it easier for

897
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,799
people to work with the program and and

898
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,960
get things done

899
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,120
and then the fifth point on this is uh

900
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,600
you have to automate everything

901
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,760
a useful security compliance program is

902
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,120
one that gets

903
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,919
out of the way and um makes

904
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,159
reduces friction as much as possible so

905
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,039
that people

906
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,919
have to think about compliance as little

907
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,360
as possible and they have to

908
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,120
invest as little time as possible into

909
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,640
the the activities you have to do for

910
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,600
compliance so access reviews can largely

911
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
be automated if you know

912
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,039
if you have your role based access

913
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,799
controls defined and

914
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,799
you meet with somebody and say hey

915
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,600
what's the process you're using for

916
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
you know doing these things manually you

917
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,039
can absolutely automate it

918
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,679
same thing with risk tracking you know

919
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,120
you don't need to manually go through

920
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,039
gear tickets and have people manually go

921
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
through gear tickets you can just write

922
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,279
a bot

923
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,279
that checks to see if the slas are being

924
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,760
met same thing with control testing and

925
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,240
auto

926
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,720
and audit evidence collection and and

927
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,480
the larger point here is you need to

928
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,440
partner with

929
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,080
your security teams engineers um tell

930
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,240
them exactly what the goal is for any

931
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,440
given control

932
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,039
and automate it um ask you ask them to

933
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,480
automate it for you get their

934
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,600
suggestions on how

935
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,159
it could possibly done or if you can do

936
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,720
it yourself

937
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,000
and all of this to say is that you need

938
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,279
a lot more

939
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,840
self-serve content you need a lot less

940
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,360
friction in your program

941
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,840
and everything you do should be about

942
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,679
the convenience

943
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,520
of your org and i think if you keep

944
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,960
those goals in mind

945
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,080
uh it makes it easier for people to work

946
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,960
with you

947
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,120
it makes the solutions that you

948
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,480
implement a lot

949
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,120
better and it helps you scale over time

950
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,480
and that should always be your goal how

951
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,120
can i make this easier for

952
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,519
you know person a team b etc

953
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,519
and so you've gone through this process

954
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,679
um you've you've got you've created your

955
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,760
policies you've created your controls

956
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,039
uh you've gone through this gap

957
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,039
assessment and and you've identified all

958
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,039
these pain points you've avoided them

959
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,440
you've implemented the remediations you

960
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,080
have

961
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,640
the next part of this is uh are our

962
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,440
audits

963
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,960
um so let's let's kind of walk through

964
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,880
that a little bit because this is a

965
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,640
this is a point that that gets missed

966
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,279
quite often i think

967
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,640
so picking an audit firm is super

968
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,360
important

969
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,399
um it's one of those things where you

970
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,159
you really do need to meet with

971
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,159
quite a few different auditing firms and

972
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,840
you need to interview them and ask them

973
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,519
really good questions you need to figure

974
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,960
out what kind of clients are they

975
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,760
working with

976
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,679
and do they have experience doing the

977
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,600
things or auditing the kinds of

978
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,120
environments that you are

979
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,279
and so an example i like to use is let's

980
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,039
say you're working with an auditing firm

981
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,600
who's only ever audited or mostly audits

982
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,519
uh people with their own data centers

983
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,799
and like these

984
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,000
really elaborate on-prem deployments and

985
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,440
they focus on those controls and they're

986
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,320
really good at that

987
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,799
that's totally fine but if you're cloud

988
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,360
native

989
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,840
and you have like continuous deployment

990
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,960
stuff like that

991
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,559
it's going to be really hard to explain

992
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,559
to them what you're doing and how

993
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,000
this is a huge problem especially

994
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
because these frameworks um

995
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,679
regulatory and not regulatory are often

996
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,519
outdated by 5 10 sometimes 15 years

997
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,840
so meet with them and ask questions like

998
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,200
what kind of controls would you

999
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,640
anticipate to see

1000
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,000
you know if we're deploying after every

1001
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,399
change to master and if they have no

1002
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,760
idea what you're talking about

1003
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,360
things will only get harder from there

1004
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,799
so you really need to interview the

1005
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,559
auditing firm um

1006
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,919
and and find the best fit another point

1007
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,600
i'd make is that

1008
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,320
you have to pick a firm based on uh the

1009
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
size of your company so what often

1010
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,399
happens is people will want

1011
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,600
one of the big four um and it can be

1012
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,679
really really challenging for small orgs

1013
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,480
because

1014
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
the bar that they set can be a lot

1015
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,240
higher because they're used to seeing a

1016
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,039
lot more

1017
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,080
elaborate enterprise-y type stuff um

1018
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,480
but it can also be extremely expensive

1019
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
so it can be hard to get advice it can

1020
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:12,960
be

1021
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,440
hard to meet the threshold that that

1022
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,120
particular auditor has

1023
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,960
um and and they also come in with their

1024
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,039
own experiences and biases and

1025
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,679
and have very strong preferences on how

1026
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,880
things are done

1027
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,200
and and you have to ask yourself do

1028
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,919
customers

1029
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,480
really care who it is i mean for folks

1030
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,519
who are doing

1031
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,080
actually doing the vendor risk reviews i

1032
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,840
mean how many times do you really see

1033
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,320
that

1034
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,000
it's not one of the big fours and you

1035
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,080
say wow this is so disqualifying

1036
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,840
most of the time you know the vendor

1037
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,000
review process is you get a soft tube

1038
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,640
report

1039
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,320
and you scroll down to that table with

1040
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,840
exceptions maybe you read

1041
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,360
section three a little bit to see what

1042
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,679
the controls are and and you call it a

1043
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,640
day

1044
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,200
and so you really have to focus on

1045
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,880
finding somebody who can work well with

1046
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,320
you and who can help you through the

1047
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,000
process but also somebody who

1048
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,440
understands um what's going on with

1049
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,440
other companies who do similar things

1050
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,200
so they can give you advice that's

1051
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,159
relevant to you

1052
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,040
and then audit periods probably the

1053
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,719
least exciting thing we're talking about

1054
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,239
today but just for the sake of

1055
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,320
completeness if anyone references this

1056
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,960
talk

1057
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,599
um later on uh everything does not need

1058
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,440
to be a one-year audit period

1059
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,918
even for sock two um which is the most

1060
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:26,719
popular

1061
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,560
you can have a three to six month window

1062
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,159
even for a sock two type two

1063
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,040
um and so just be aware that you don't

1064
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,520
need to take your organization

1065
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
through this massive like two-year

1066
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,000
ordeal to get your audit report

1067
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,239
um you can start small and build up if

1068
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,918
you have the budget for it

1069
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,159
um then you can absolutely do a shorter

1070
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,040
window

1071
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,560
i thought that was just a finer point

1072
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,239
that uh needed to be made

1073
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,879
um and so for getting ready for the

1074
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,200
audit the audit prep and doing the audit

1075
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,920
um you need to communicate with

1076
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,640
everybody

1077
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
very very early on you need to let them

1078
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,839
know

1079
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,160
what you're doing what they should have

1080
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
to expect

1081
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,359
and tell them essentially

1082
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,640
um you know we're gonna spend like two

1083
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,160
weeks collecting evidence we're going to

1084
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,880
spend

1085
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,119
you know large amounts of time talking

1086
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,400
to the auditors there's going to be a

1087
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,680
lot of back and forth

1088
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
if you let them people know a week ahead

1089
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,760
of time there's this constant

1090
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,079
scramble this constant rush and it's

1091
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,440
very very

1092
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,119
unpleasant for everyone so just keep

1093
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,880
that in mind um

1094
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
and then i like to meet with everyone

1095
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,320
four weeks ahead of time

1096
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,960
really think about this um you know

1097
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,160
ahead of time

1098
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,560
get ahead of it for i like to do four

1099
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,359
weeks

1100
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,160
you can do it even earlier than that um

1101
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,520
and then i like to leave at least two

1102
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,960
weeks for evidence collection so i'm

1103
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,720
sure if you've been part of audit

1104
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,920
maybe not on the grc side um and you get

1105
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,000
a request saying hey we need

1106
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,320
um you know this massive listing of

1107
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,440
things and then we're gonna

1108
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,040
you know auditors will randomly pick

1109
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,359
from them it's a complete disaster

1110
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,800
so you need to get ahead of it give

1111
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,560
people at least two weeks and even

1112
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,160
before then they should know it's it's

1113
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,560
um

1114
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,119
it's coming and to anticipate it um and

1115
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,160
and be specific

1116
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,240
with everything you do if you copy and

1117
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,440
paste um

1118
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,680
the requests from the auditing firm

1119
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,359
nobody will have any clue what you're

1120
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,320
talking about

1121
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,880
nobody except you really understands

1122
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,320
what they're asking for because you're

1123
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,079
the one who built the relationship

1124
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,680
you're the one who's worked with your

1125
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,359
controls the most

1126
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,160
and so be as specific as you can say i

1127
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,520
need a screenshot

1128
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,440
with your time tray down of this

1129
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,880
specific dashboard

1130
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,920
get to that level of granularity and

1131
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,480
also

1132
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,079
make sure everyone knows what to expect

1133
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,160
for walkthroughs let them know hey

1134
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,200
they're going to sample

1135
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,800
evidence that we submitted during

1136
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,640
evidence collection here's a list of

1137
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,000
other things that will probably come up

1138
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,520
be ready to talk about

1139
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,200
some of the policies and walk through

1140
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,720
dashboards and stuff like that

1141
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,880
and i i think the top-level point here

1142
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,280
is for you it's it's just another day

1143
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,280
um you've gone through this process many

1144
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,119
many times or maybe you've

1145
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,720
you're doing this for the first time but

1146
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,800
you've been very close to it for a very

1147
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,000
long time

1148
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,200
for other folks it can be very high

1149
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,640
anxiety so be very empathetic and just

1150
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,520
understand that you know the engineering

1151
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,079
product

1152
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,520
all these other teams i t are also doing

1153
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,040
their work on top of all of this so plan

1154
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,440
as far ahead as you possibly can and and

1155
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,599
have a high level of empathy because it

1156
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,880
really will go a long way

1157
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,680
and so life after audit so let's say you

1158
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,359
go through this audit process

1159
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,480
um and you wake up the next morning and

1160
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,960
you get your cup of coffee maybe it's a

1161
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,560
really nice pour over

1162
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,880
you got really nice beans from costa

1163
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,000
rica that's my preference

1164
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
you walk out and you see these trees in

1165
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,040
your backyard and

1166
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,960
the light is coming through the trees

1167
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,560
and it's really beautiful you

1168
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,240
kind of stretch a little bit and you say

1169
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,480
wow this is fantastic we're absolutely

1170
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,400
done now this this feels so great all

1171
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:00,880
the

1172
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,520
stress and anxiety is gone what do you

1173
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,000
do after

1174
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,040
that um the work doesn't stop there

1175
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,680
right this is a continual process and it

1176
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,760
absolutely never ends as long as you

1177
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,040
have these requirements

1178
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,480
you need to maintain them you need to

1179
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
keep doing audits um

1180
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,440
and so i you know doing a retro is so

1181
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,800
important

1182
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,599
after every audit i like to do um invite

1183
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,440
everyone who is involved with audit for

1184
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,720
like a wider retro

1185
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,800
and then also do like team specific

1186
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,160
things if there was maybe

1187
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,400
um some struggles with a particular team

1188
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,839
and and have

1189
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,480
frame it as an open conversation where

1190
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,200
any and all feedback direct or otherwise

1191
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,000
um is is welcome and so you want to um

1192
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,680
outline what went well

1193
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,520
what didn't go so great and what could

1194
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,960
be improved um and

1195
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,240
and be very honest ask folks for their

1196
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,640
most

1197
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,119
honest direct feedback get what they're

1198
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,880
actually thinking

1199
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,440
and then act on it write it down create

1200
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,720
a jira ticket out of it

1201
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,400
and start implementing some of these

1202
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,800
things right away because no matter how

1203
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,440
well

1204
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,280
you try to do or how well you think you

1205
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,440
do there's always room for improvement

1206
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,599
and and that little bit

1207
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,640
of effort to try to figure out how you

1208
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,160
could make it easier for

1209
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,720
all the other teams goes a very long way

1210
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,240
the next point is after your audit keep

1211
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,200
on automating

1212
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,440
so all that evidence you collected for

1213
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,880
the audit you know

1214
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,680
how can a bot do it next time right um

1215
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,960
all those things that you need to keep

1216
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,079
monitoring for

1217
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,320
you know making sure that your slas are

1218
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,680
met making sure that

1219
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,320
pull requests are reviewed and approved

1220
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,160
you you can write a bot to do that and

1221
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,920
and so after your audit kind of figure

1222
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,760
out where were all the pain points

1223
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,200
what are some of the things we need to

1224
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,359
maintain um and

1225
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,160
and um you know make a list and start

1226
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,680
socializing it with people

1227
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,480
so if you can't do it yourself take that

1228
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,760
list take those ideas

1229
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,640
socialize it with teams frame it as hey

1230
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,079
look we know this stuff is really

1231
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,520
painful we know you don't want to be

1232
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,480
doing it

1233
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,280
but you know do you see any way that

1234
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,880
maybe you could write some automation

1235
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,400
that will

1236
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,599
help you stay on top of this stuff um

1237
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,280
and if you can do it yourself even

1238
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,599
better

1239
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
um the next point is to just keep

1240
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,079
simplifying um

1241
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,720
you know everything can always be done

1242
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,359
better

1243
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,800
um and um you know processes can be

1244
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,839
improved

1245
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,480
uh they you know words can always be

1246
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,359
taken out

1247
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,839
and if we go back to you know one of the

1248
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,680
the first slides where we talked a

1249
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,640
little bit about

1250
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
you know the ultimate policy if somebody

1251
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,160
reads it and they actually know what's

1252
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,119
going on

1253
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,240
uh keep working towards that goal um

1254
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,440
and you know we we talked a lot about

1255
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,200
some of the things that you practically

1256
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,440
can do to build out this program

1257
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,760
but the reality is we're all gonna miss

1258
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,119
the mark all the time

1259
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,400
and um you know figure out where you

1260
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,599
didn't do so well

1261
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,079
keep improving on it i mean you know i'm

1262
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,560
on program number five or six that i've

1263
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,359
built

1264
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,240
various you know sizes of of company

1265
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,800
i've

1266
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,119
you know being in roles where maybe i

1267
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,880
wasn't as technical and those were

1268
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,280
being technical and i always miss the

1269
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,160
mark um

1270
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,400
on something and that's totally normal

1271
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
we're all human and so keep simplifying

1272
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,200
everything

1273
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,800
keep working on all of those points and

1274
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,920
just have in mind that you know everyone

1275
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,119
you work with

1276
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,560
is a partner of yours and

1277
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,520
your ultimate goal is to make things as

1278
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,040
simple and frictionless

1279
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,079
as possible for them um and then you

1280
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:40,880
know the third

1281
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,040
is you know the point can always come

1282
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,560
sooner um

1283
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,079
you know when you're when you're going

1284
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,160
through some of these exercises with

1285
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,839
like testing controls and writing

1286
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:52,880
automation

1287
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,359
um just keep in mind that you know

1288
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,720
having just

1289
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,160
the context and goal and

1290
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,680
end state in mind always helps

1291
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,280
and so kind of with that to the point of

1292
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,280
the point can always come sooner

1293
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,839
i guess we can open it up for some

1294
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,400
questions

1295
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,319
if there are any

1296
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,599
trying to unmute myself uh i didn't make

1297
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,040
an announcement for questions up front

1298
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,760
and that was my

1299
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,040
my bad but um i didn't see any thus far

1300
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,240
i did make a comment

1301
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,720
in the uh the discord so we can give uh

1302
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,480
people a couple more moments

1303
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,760
and i can see if there's any questions

1304
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,079
that shake loose um

1305
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,520
if not thanks for the talk

1306
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,359
ah there is there is one question from

1307
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,960
uh

1308
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,000
scan scandra anan

1309
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,680
what determines whether independent

1310
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,760
auditors can start placing reliance on

1311
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,200
your testing of controls

1312
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,040
essentially trying to reduce the impact

1313
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,000
of multiple audits

1314
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,280
you can you see that question one more

1315
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,040
time or can you maybe copy and paste it

1316
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,800
into the question box here

1317
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,480
just like i know uh i'm getting yeah let

1318
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,319
me see i might use your house if i can

1319
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,319
send it to you via chat

1320
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,520
send chat message

1321
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,240
actually i'll try it again because it's

1322
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,720
not working very well what determines

1323
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,119
whether

1324
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,359
independent auditors can start placing

1325
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,079
reliance on your testing of controls

1326
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,240
essentially trying to reduce the impact

1327
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,319
of multiple audits

1328
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,760
i think that for so statement

1329
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,440
so so i i think your your actual testing

1330
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,599
of controls doesn't matter so much

1331
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,520
uh as much as their testing of your

1332
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,720
controls

1333
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,640
so what ends up happening is like there

1334
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,480
are a portion of some frameworks well

1335
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,000
they'll see that are you doing some

1336
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,079
continuous monitoring activities

1337
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,960
um your own testing of your controls is

1338
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,880
more for your own visibility so you know

1339
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,079
what's going on

1340
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,160
um and and you can make corrective

1341
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,200
action if there

1342
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,880
are any issues when they when auditors

1343
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,359
come in

1344
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,520
and they start testing your controls um

1345
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,880
they'll have their preference for how

1346
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,319
they do it um

1347
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,160
and you know i think before testing

1348
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,079
starts uh they'll obviously

1349
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,560
assess the the suitability of the design

1350
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,319
and operation of your control so i think

1351
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:16,720
it's

1352
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,839
it's more a question of um you know how

1353
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,800
do you

1354
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,720
is your process built in a way that's

1355
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,480
going to meet the requirement

1356
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,640
so it's designed correctly and is your

1357
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,720
control operating correctly and then

1358
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,240
your testing is just for your own

1359
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:37,839
internal visibility of if it's working

1360
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,440
all right and there was a one more

1361
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,359
question from iron heat

1362
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,520
do you have any suggestions for getting

1363
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,440
business support for unsupported

1364
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,480
mandates

1365
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,480
for example management says get us

1366
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,760
compliant with 800-171 but you have

1367
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,800
little support

1368
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,200
from the sysadmins help desk or business

1369
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,000
and the

1370
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,839
executive that made the mandate gives no

1371
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,680
teeth behind it

1372
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,440
oh that's that's a really great question

1373
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,839
um so this this happens all the time i

1374
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:04,640
i'd say

1375
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,760
your best bet is um go back

1376
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,280
and you know go through this process of

1377
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,720
telling folks hey look

1378
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,000
you know i'm being honest i have 171

1379
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,880
they want me to

1380
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,839
meet all these controls um you know

1381
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,680
there isn't much of a

1382
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,640
an appetite real appetite or bite behind

1383
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,200
it or

1384
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,560
wide um and you know there is some

1385
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,000
support though so

1386
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,480
like let's walk through some of these

1387
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,240
things and are there things that you've

1388
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,680
wanted to do for a while

1389
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,200
can you tell me what some of those

1390
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,359
things are and maybe you can map

1391
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,480
some of those things back to um the

1392
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,920
requirements you need to meet

1393
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,359
um i i think if you give people

1394
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,160
a reason to start working on things they

1395
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,359
want to work on

1396
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,760
because of compliance that's absolutely

1397
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,880
perfect i think

1398
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,400
you have to loosen your standards a

1399
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,079
little bit at that point and say

1400
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,160
you know you probably won't get it

1401
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,119
perfect

1402
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,280
but just document um where any of the

1403
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,319
gaps are and

1404
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,400
um go back to the executive and say hey

1405
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,560
we've been able to make progress on

1406
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,280
these things

1407
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,040
um but everything else it doesn't seem

1408
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,240
like people feel like there's enough

1409
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,280
support for this

1410
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,560
um or um you know it doesn't seem like

1411
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,079
um there's enough business interest for

1412
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,520
people to start dropping the things

1413
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,040
they're doing so i think that

1414
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,119
the main point is everyone all the

1415
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,119
sysadmins all the developers

1416
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,319
want to do things and so there's a

1417
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,760
really good chance that some of the

1418
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,000
things that they otherwise want to do

1419
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,160
fit into some of your requirements and

1420
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,680
sometimes you have to get creative look

1421
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,800
at what they're doing

1422
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,520
and see if maybe you can't show some

1423
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,560
goodwill by

1424
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,240
saying okay this partially meets it but

1425
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,720
can we maybe like tweak this one setting

1426
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,760
and be specific

1427
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,560
so a problem i i see often is you know

1428
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,119
will

1429
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,200
you know security compliance teams will

1430
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,400
go to folks and say

1431
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,920
hey we need to meet this requirement

1432
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,680
please meet it um but if

1433
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,400
if you can give specific suggestions um

1434
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,800
like maybe enable this or disable that

1435
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,200
or

1436
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,160
you know like you know can this be done

1437
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,440
or maybe do it yourself

1438
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,440
maybe there's a way for you to you know

1439
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,280
get looped into that process

1440
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,040
um and to start implementing some of the

1441
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,720
changes itself um

1442
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,560
if you're not technical that might be an

1443
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,920
issue or if there's like

1444
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,800
rigid like siloing between what people

1445
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,480
can do that might be an issue

1446
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,119
um but yeah i think that's the most you

1447
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,079
can do

1448
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,400
for a situation like that and just

1449
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,920
document everything so i come from the

1450
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,359
healthcare space everything gets

1451
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,720
documented all the time

1452
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,160
if it wasn't written down it didn't

1453
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,160
happen um if you have pushback or you

1454
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,079
can't get something done for some reason

1455
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,000
write down who you talk to write down

1456
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,440
what the conversation was

1457
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,200
and then when you get asked about it you

1458
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,480
can give it to the those

1459
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,079
that documentation to the business and

1460
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,000
say hey look you know you need to make a

1461
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,839
decision on what to do

1462
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,200
all right and there's uh one more

1463
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,640
question from looks like

1464
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,520
aldrias what are the examples of things

1465
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,520
that cis admins and engineers

1466
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,040
have wanted to do that

1467
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,720
that they leveraged compliance to get

1468
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,520
done sorry about that

1469
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,960
so i i mean

1470
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,760
you can run the gamut on on things like

1471
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,720
um

1472
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,200
i'll use vulnerability management as an

1473
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,760
example

1474
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,680
um and maybe this isn't specific to

1475
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,119
justice admins but

1476
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,559
um one of the problems in security

1477
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,000
compliance is that vulnerability

1478
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,839
management has become synonymous with

1479
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:30,400
like

1480
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,319
just scanning everything and getting

1481
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,400
this massive list of things that

1482
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,079
nobody really knows what to do with and

1483
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,839
most of them are false positives

1484
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,520
um but you know oftentimes um

1485
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,760
there will want to be some more

1486
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,040
automation in place

1487
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,240
for um you know deploying

1488
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,559
um infrastructure so maybe you can use

1489
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,400
an infrastructure deployment tool

1490
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,319
and then your vulnerable vulnerability

1491
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,400
management position can be

1492
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,160
hey look if you can get this

1493
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,079
infrastructure deployment automated

1494
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,720
um our vulnerability management can be

1495
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,720
um you know periodic reviews

1496
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,520
of like your terraform conflicts um and

1497
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,800
stuff like that so

1498
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,160
um you know other things might be that

1499
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,280
um you know segmented environments right

1500
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,359
not using test data stuff like that

1501
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,920
i think most uh sys admins don't want to

1502
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,040
be playing in

1503
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,079
production um using um

1504
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,280
production and so there might be a

1505
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,599
desire to move to maybe like a staging

1506
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,800
environment

1507
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,480
for better testing and maybe that's not

1508
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,119
in place and maybe that's a conversation

1509
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,720
you can have with some of the technical

1510
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,520
teams to say

1511
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,960
hey look you've been wanting to do this

1512
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,000
thing you've been wanting to have

1513
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,440
segmented environments

1514
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,680
um you know let's let's make that happen

1515
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,520
we have a business case for it now

1516
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,359
um but you'd really have to pick like

1517
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,040
really specific things and

1518
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,520
um you know and sometimes it's not easy

1519
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,640
to say that

1520
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,119
um you know here are the specific things

1521
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,079
that uh

1522
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,079
you know a person might have everyone's

1523
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,119
organ structure

1524
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,079
is different everyone's environment is

1525
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:02,800
different

1526
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,599
um and sometimes it takes um you know

1527
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,000
you

1528
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,160
talking to a sis admin and saying hey

1529
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,680
what are some of the things you're doing

1530
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,280
what are some of the things that are in

1531
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,160
your backlog

1532
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,680
and kind of mapping that then to your

1533
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,279
to your controls that you need to get

1534
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,680
implemented
