2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:07,680
hey everyone

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,160
happy saturday morning thanks for waking

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,800
up early

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
all right so today we're going to talk

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,720
about cyber security in the

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,199
aviation industry and if you're

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,519
expecting this to be a presentation on

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,680
hacking airplanes i am sorry to

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,240
disappoint you

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,920
well we'll cover a little bit of

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,519
background information but it's really

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,320
going to be more on the uh

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,680
overall posture of the cybersecurity

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,120
ecosystem

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,039
in the aviation industry

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,640
so of course i have my disclaimer

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,559
because i like what i do

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,079
and i want to keep presenting at

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,239
conferences like b-sides so none of this

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,520
is endorsed by or sponsored by any

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,840
producer

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,079
uh employers that i have because i still

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,440
like working for them and it's an

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,079
overall

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,239
reflection of my experiences in the

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,920
aviation cyber security industry

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,040
most importantly everything that i found

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,560
you can find on the open internet

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,119
nothing

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,520
is a proprietary and i'm a huge advocate

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,880
of showing your references

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
so i will give all of that at the end of

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,240
this presentation

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,479
the little qr code is i would love your

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,479
feedback it's for a quick survey i have

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,479
if this was what you expected or if

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,799
there's any topics that

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,400
i didn't cover that you'd like to hear

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,640
in future presentations so one of

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,880
the times i gave this presentation

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,400
someone wanted more

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,240
information on the uh

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,159
sort of like the the certification

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,360
process

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,399
so i was able to uh try to dig out some

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,680
more information to answer more

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
questions

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,479
all right so just a little bit about me

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,079
um so you know i'm not full of uh

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,000
fud and i'm not making all of this up

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,280
but about

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,840
12 years ago i began as a software

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,360
developer

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,919
by degree that wasn't a huge fan of

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,959
coding all the time it doesn't spark joy

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,239
but i love interacting with people so

58
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,440
when i'm not doing cyber security i'm

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,120
a curler by trade so that would be

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
awesome to keep doing again once the

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,400
pandemic is done

62
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,920
i was super fortunate that when i

63
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,000
started my career out of college i was

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,440
able to work on a bunch of

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,519
transportation related programs so i

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,400
worked on a

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
air commander control system i worked on

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
a gps system used by aircraft and

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,840
eventually found my way to uh

70
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
avionics where i got to work on an

71
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,879
in-flight entertainment system which was

72
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:53,680
really cool

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
so i focused on the uh the crew terminal

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
and its functionality specifically for

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,720
the ife system

76
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,040
and i got very lucky again that i was at

77
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,080
the right place at the right

78
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,599
time where i found the cyber security

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,480
product uh

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,360
director and was able to make a

81
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,159
connection

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,400
and since i got into security i just

83
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
never looked back so i've been

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,159
geeking out for about six years doing

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,400
that

86
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,000
all right um

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,959
scope so to cover that before i start

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,400
talking about anything in specifics i

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,280
want to just frame

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
the scope of the discussion so we're

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
going to talk about some regulatory

92
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,680
aspects

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,159
the players and components in the

94
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,599
aviation ecosystem

95
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,400
and then i end with some use cases and

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,159
experiences i had which is

97
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,200
great so the um

98
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
not specific hacking i'm not talking

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,040
about hacking on planes because

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,319
please don't do that but more of

101
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,239
here's potential use cases that may lead

102
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,080
to vulnerabilities

103
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,400
so for anybody who works in the industry

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
this is an overview

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,519
probably no more than i do or what i'm

106
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,439
going to present so if you have

107
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,120
questions

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,159
stick them in discord i'm gonna hope to

109
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,600
to look at things when i can but i know

110
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,880
our moderator is gonna

111
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,639
do an excellent job of pinging me as

112
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,880
well

113
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
cyber security regulation

114
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,880
so regulation varies depending on the

115
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
location that you're in

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,280
and for a supplier manufacturer it's

117
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,639
important because they have to comply

118
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,440
with several

119
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,360
different government agencies

120
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
specifically for this presentation i'm

121
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
going to focus on

122
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,280
the current u.s regulation but it's very

123
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,120
similar to the eu

124
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,840
and other regulatory authorities so

125
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,960
specifically

126
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,800
for aviation cyber security there are

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,320
three key documents

128
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,800
and here come all the fun acronyms and

129
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
numbers uh

130
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,160
d o stands for document or document

131
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
order and when you get the hard copy

132
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,080
printouts they are these like

133
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280
big thick books that uh

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
if you have insomnia they're great for

135
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,600
like bedside reading

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,720
and we're going to start with do uh 326

137
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,360
a so airworthiness security process

138
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,199
specification

139
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,520
so why do we need this process when

140
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,720
safety assessments were

141
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,360
initially developed they focused on a

142
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,000
failure

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,720
of onboard systems and not failure

144
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,639
caused by a

145
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,199
malicious intent so this process fills

146
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,560
the gaps by defining

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,639
security scope for the certification

148
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,080
process for new development

149
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,720
of systems or modification of existing

150
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,080
systems

151
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
so in addition to the scope it lists a

152
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,440
long

153
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,039
list of additional requirements

154
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,039
including having a security risk

155
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,160
assessments

156
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,680
and other effective requirements

157
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,000
the next one is do356a

158
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
it explains the methods to show

159
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,319
compliance to the profit

160
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,520
processes reference in do326a so for

161
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,080
example

162
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
if you're developing a security

163
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,600
architecture what should be your

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
corresponding measures for that

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,080
if there's any assurance guidance for

166
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,840
verification activities like threat

167
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,720
assessments

168
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,039
or what systems should you have logging

169
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,639
enabled so that they're properly

170
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,680
monitoring

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,120
your environment so you can be aided in

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,960
incident response

173
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,240
lastly there's do-355 so

174
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,639
once the plane is flying how do you

175
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,280
ensure

176
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,000
the cyber security of that aircraft once

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
it's been handed over to the air

178
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,560
operator

179
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,919
so this uh regulation and document was

180
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,520
really important when i worked at

181
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
american airlines this is the one that

182
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:45,919
the

183
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,039
security team specifically looked at so

184
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,000
it highlights what you should have in

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,240
regards to incident response

186
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,039
what personnel roles you need from an

187
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,720
aircraft

188
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,440
information security specialist which is

189
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,880
relatively new

190
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,599
type of role

191
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,919
all right

192
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
so cyber security regulation so who

193
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,000
needs to follow

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,199
these three documents specifically it's

195
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,520
for

196
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,319
aircraft with special conditions and

197
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,919
what causes an aircraft

198
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,039
to have a special condition

199
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,360
so this is directly from

200
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,199
an faa document that says this airplane

201
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,039
will have a novel or unusual design

202
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,880
feature when compared to the state of

203
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,479
technology envisioned

204
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,400
in the airworthiness standards for

205
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,479
transport category airplanes

206
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,160
these new connectivity capabilities

207
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,759
may result in security vulnerabilities

208
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,840
to the airplane's critical systems for

209
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,199
these design features

210
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,039
the application the applicable

211
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,879
airworthiness regulations

212
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,800
do not contain adequate or appropriate

213
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
safety standards for protection and

214
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,280
security

215
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,360
of airplane systems and data networks

216
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
against unauthorized access

217
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
these special conditions contain the

218
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
additional safety standards that the

219
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,759
administrators consider necessary to

220
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,840
establish a level of safety equivalent

221
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,440
to that established by existing

222
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,039
standards

223
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,520
uh very long-winded but in a nutshell

224
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,800
back in the day when these planes were

225
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,599
created

226
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,879
we didn't have these networks and

227
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,800
systems on the planes therefore

228
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,560
this special conditions is going to

229
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,319
cover those gaps

230
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,400
so what types of aircraft have these

231
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,759
special conditions

232
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,799
examples would be like the 787 737 max

233
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,080
a350

234
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,360
anything that has um the newer types of

235
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,000
networking

236
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
systems on board so

237
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
what do we do for these aircraft we have

238
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,760
something

239
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,320
called an ansp which is an aircraft

240
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,040
network security program

241
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,920
and this ansp is an agreement between

242
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,240
the

243
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
air operator and the manufacturers on

244
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
how they plan to

245
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,240
secure the aircraft and that's signed

246
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,000
off by your regulatory body which would

247
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,320
be

248
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,080
the faa in the u.s so the ansp

249
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,839
captures um guidance

250
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,680
and so that like if there's any system

251
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
modifications or updates they're not

252
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,560
going to negatively err

253
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,200
impact the continuing airworthiness due

254
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,600
to cyber security vulnerabilities

255
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,880
and most often the ansp

256
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,519
is leveraging existing cyber security

257
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,760
frameworks like the nist

258
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,120
cyber security framework and it uses

259
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,959
common standards as well

260
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,040
so the main takeaway from these

261
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,560
documentation

262
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,600
is that its emphasis is on safety of

263
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,640
flight

264
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,279
and framing that in the aspect of cyber

265
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,080
security

266
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,800
so how do we do that by using a defense

267
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,279
in-depth

268
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,160
security approach

269
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,800
all right so who needs to follow these

270
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,079
regulations

271
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,760
there are a lot of players in the

272
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,200
aviation ecosystem

273
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
and there's several lists but the one i

274
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,320
like

275
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,880
the most is a compilation from the 2018

276
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,040
us national strategy for aviation

277
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,320
security

278
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,160
and they highlight uh that there are six

279
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720
a's or six players in the game

280
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,000
and the first one is aircraft so of

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,360
course the plane itself

282
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,399
and prior to covid there were over 24

283
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,720
commercial flights daily over the u.s

284
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
and the category includes government and

285
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
private aircraft in that

286
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,240
figure the next player are the airlines

287
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
so what's highlighted in the airline

288
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,079
section is that there are airlines of

289
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,399
multiple sizes covering functional scope

290
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,399
of operations and maintenance

291
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,839
so you want to consider that there are

292
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,480
several different uh enterprise networks

293
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,160
of an airline that span more than just

294
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,000
the aircraft so you may have a separate

295
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,519
passenger system

296
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,040
or a ground system but

297
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,320
that all flowing information my favorite

298
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,560
sentence in regards to the airlines

299
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,360
is how an airline is managed has impact

300
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
on its safety and the security of the

301
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,200
aviation ecosystem

302
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
every player on the slide has an equal

303
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,279
impact to the ecosystem

304
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,200
none of them is more important than the

305
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,480
others

306
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
uh the next one is air lift and when i

307
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
first read about this i was like huh

308
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,920
what is that but airless are just the

309
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,360
cargo version

310
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,519
of airlines and even though they don't

311
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,279
have passengers they have

312
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,200
the same stringency of regulation so

313
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,360
just because it's cargo doesn't mean

314
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,519
it's any easier

315
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,320
and more importantly they have an

316
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,640
amazing great economic impact

317
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,920
uh the air international air transport

318
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,279
association

319
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,880
said that the uh world trade by value

320
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,480
of these cargo airlifts is about six

321
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,160
trillion dollars that is being

322
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,560
transported so any impact to them is

323
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,120
huge to the economy

324
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,000
next are airports there's over 44 000

325
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,920
airports globally

326
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,519
and about 19 000 in the us so when you

327
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,880
think of airports you might think of

328
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,200
like the big hubs that you see or maybe

329
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
some small regional ones

330
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,279
but they also include package and

331
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,120
package delivery hubs and logistical

332
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,279
airports and logistical airports are

333
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,639
really cool

334
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,240
because uh if you have ever seen them

335
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,079
they're where like aircraft scenes are

336
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,560
filmed for movies or where aircraft our

337
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,880
airlines store aircraft

338
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,000
when they're not being used right now in

339
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,240
addition to the physical

340
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,959
uh airport location itself the entity

341
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,720
that runs the airport is also included

342
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,839
in this category

343
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,360
and that could vary some are privately

344
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,120
owned some are owned by

345
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
a city or public authorities so that's

346
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,600
included as well

347
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,639
next is aviation management so that is

348
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,600
your national

349
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,560
or international regulatory body and

350
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,760
they manage the

351
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,399
operation administration of the aviation

352
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,560
ecosystem so of course the faa in the

353
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,120
u.s

354
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,519
eos and europe and there are several

355
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,160
individual

356
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,560
civil uh aviation authorities in other

357
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,600
countries

358
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,839
so that's for the us that would be where

359
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,760
air traffic control would reside

360
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,519
lastly our actors and this group is

361
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,600
categorized as people or entities that

362
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,279
operate maintain

363
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,320
uh or utilize the

364
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,639
aspects of the aviation ecosystem so

365
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,480
this includes

366
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,880
i see it as a very wide catch-all bucket

367
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,560
which i'm not a huge fan of but it

368
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,519
includes

369
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,920
the original equipment manufacturers

370
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,560
also known as oem's

371
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,839
suppliers so like in-flight

372
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,600
entertainment companies or internet

373
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,680
connectivity providers

374
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,839
and contractors so your cleaning crews

375
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,399
your food service suppliers

376
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,040
they also include

377
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,399
[Music]

378
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,040
threat actors in this group which i

379
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,600
don't

380
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,480
i don't think it's fair or insider

381
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,199
threats

382
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,120
because they can exist inside of their

383
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,959
specifically can exist anywhere

384
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,239
inside either of these six groups listed

385
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,079
all right

386
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,920
so now we know how the players fit into

387
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,240
the operational aspects of the aviation

388
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,120
ecosystem

389
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,399
excuse me so now i know who the players

390
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,160
are we know the regulatory background

391
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,360
now i'm going to talk about how the

392
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,160
players fit

393
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,920
into the operational aspects of the

394
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,079
ecosystem i'm not a pilot

395
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,320
so when i was trying to frame the scope

396
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,079
of how i was going to talk about this i

397
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,760
took it as a passenger because most

398
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,880
people can relate to

399
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,160
flying so i'm going to talk about in

400
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,320
regards to what happens before a flight

401
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
during a flight or after a flight

402
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,079
so what a passenger sees barely

403
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,240
scratches the surface

404
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,800
and uh this graphic that i'm showing

405
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,720
right now is courtesy of nasa

406
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,839
and it captures the major components but

407
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,839
just remember that they're framing it

408
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,920
from a government perspective so if

409
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,320
you're like there's something missing uh

410
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,680
that's the reason why

411
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,880
all right so before the flight

412
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,399
before you buy your ticket there's

413
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,079
several activities in place so that you

414
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,440
can reserve your seat

415
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,639
or ship your cargo on an airlift carrier

416
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,399
if we go back to our certification the

417
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,000
aircraft needs to be certified

418
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,959
uh safe to fly by your civil aviation

419
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,079
authority

420
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,440
and you need to have approved staff

421
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,000
to do that so you have your approved

422
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,120
pilots

423
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,079
that know they they do their check

424
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,079
around the aircraft

425
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,759
even when you walk before you walk into

426
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,199
the airport you have your

427
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,279
tsa your transportation security in the

428
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,240
u.s customs and border patrol staff

429
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,800
you have your airport ground crews your

430
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,360
airline gate crews additional flight

431
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,959
crew

432
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,680
that have all been embedded beforehand

433
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,800
then you go to planning

434
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
so what staff is needed you need a staff

435
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,839
certified certified to fly that specific

436
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,079
aircraft

437
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,240
how many flights are needed overall what

438
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
type of aircraft do you need

439
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,600
for example you're not going to want a

440
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,120
regional jet for a long-haul

441
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
international flight

442
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,000
and then you jump into reservations so

443
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
what passenger and cargo options are

444
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
available to

445
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,399
to offer to the public do you need next

446
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,360
day delivery

447
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,199
do you need full uh internet

448
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,839
connectivity on those long haul flights

449
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,519
and what locations are you gonna offer

450
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,680
that at

451
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,519
next you have what happens in the

452
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,519
ecosystem during your flight

453
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,839
so as your amazon prime package spends

454
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,959
so many hours

455
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,759
on the aircraft or you're sitting in

456
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,639
your seat

457
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,480
there's even more going on behind the

458
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,800
scenes you have your

459
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
avionics system that's active on the

460
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,920
aircraft

461
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,040
you have your cabin functionality which

462
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,240
either is

463
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
available to the passenger or to the

464
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
clerk to the crew

465
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,959
so a good example i like to give from a

466
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,079
a crew standpoint

467
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,079
is that weather is very important so you

468
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,160
want to make sure weather information

469
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,280
uh is being accurately

470
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
transmitted to the aircraft so that the

471
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,439
flight crew can make accurate decisions

472
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,799
on the best course of travel and then

473
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,400
you have your air traffic management

474
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,359
that's providing

475
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,639
navigation information

476
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,320
lastly you have after your flight so

477
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,679
once you land there's still

478
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,400
a lot going on once you're on the ground

479
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,320
so your plane gets checked again

480
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,039
by the pilot uh they may need to call

481
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,640
the ground crew or the ground crew does

482
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,760
their own checks to

483
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,000
say that there needs to be maintenance

484
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,280
you want to make sure your bags get

485
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,160
routed

486
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,600
to either the baggage claim if you're

487
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,160
done with your journey or to

488
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,559
the next flight that you're going on and

489
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,240
then there's information

490
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,840
regarding the flights themselves so are

491
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,559
you

492
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,000
going to run to the other end of the

493
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,520
airport because your next flight is in

494
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,640
the other terminal

495
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,200
and then there's even uh continued comms

496
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,919
with

497
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,559
ground systems so if you put everything

498
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,080
i said together

499
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,559
that is the operational aspects of the

500
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,039
aviation ecosystem

501
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,520
awesome now we have to secure all of

502
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,840
this

503
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,120
what is aviation cyber security

504
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,360
so it's every single system related to

505
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,799
the functions that i previously

506
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:31,840
referenced

507
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,520
so now i'm going to speak about the

508
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,760
experiences i've had

509
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,880
in the industry so i was on a

510
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,799
aviation cyber security team when i

511
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,320
worked for american airlines and then

512
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,559
panasonic avionics so their point of

513
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,000
view is from a third-party supplier

514
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,440
here is another nifty graphic that i

515
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,039
really like it's from

516
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,600
the american institute of aeronautics

517
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
and astronautics

518
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,280
and in 2013 they developed a white paper

519
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,120
entitled a framework for

520
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,240
aviation cyber security and they had a

521
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,240
section that references

522
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,960
that aviation and the evolution of

523
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,919
information

524
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,520
uh and communications technology

525
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,760
and what it highlighted was that once

526
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,840
the plane was a closed system

527
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,880
and then due to

528
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,600
events in industry it expanded based off

529
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,480
of demand

530
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,320
and i'll give more specifics on that

531
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,919
later in my presentation

532
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,600
and if you're thinking oh i want to read

533
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,960
this paper don't worry

534
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,679
i have everything referenced at the end

535
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,679
of my presentation with links

536
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,400
so that you can find it later if you

537
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,840
want to read up on that

538
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,679
more importantly i have this

539
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,280
presentation

540
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,760
in pdf format on my website so you can

541
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,480
go to

542
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,559
olivia stella.com if you want to get a

543
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,840
copy of that

544
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,200
all right

545
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,679
so now that you're thinking about

546
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,280
securing all this data

547
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,640
you have to do it for each part of the

548
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,559
system and it's a lot

549
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,000
and you can't do it by yourself no

550
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
matter how big of a company you are

551
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,159
and more importantly you're dependent on

552
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,320
others in the ecosystem

553
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,480
and you're under the watchful eye of

554
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559
your government jurisdiction

555
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,159
so i'm going to start with the focus

556
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,679
from the airplane

557
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,080
because that was my initial point of

558
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,159
entry into the ecosystem

559
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,039
so the ecosystem employee experience

560
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,960
versus the passenger experience

561
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,799
is a little bit different so when you

562
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,400
think of onboard systems

563
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
there's the native ones like the

564
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,440
avionics

565
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,600
then there's your third-party systems

566
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,039
like your passenger internet

567
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,400
connectivity in the internet

568
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,440
uh the entertainment systems so

569
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,520
how do we uh talk to the rest of the

570
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,000
world via these systems well

571
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,320
ground communication is different than

572
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,080
connectivity in flight so if you think

573
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,280
about your

574
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,080
your wi-fi and your cellular versus your

575
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,360
satcom

576
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,679
you're just and then you have to support

577
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,159
all the infrastructure for these

578
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:17,840
communication systems

579
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,799
then you have your external environment

580
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,840
the systems

581
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,799
that support that so if you're thinking

582
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,360
from

583
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
an airport perspective you'd have your

584
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,919
ticket kiosks your baggage claim systems

585
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,280
and any on-site

586
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,440
maintenance systems if you go another

587
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,360
level removed you can think of all the

588
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,760
uh

589
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,400
iot internet of things devices and

590
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,120
systems

591
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,480
that your third-party companies are

592
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,880
using so for instance the catering crew

593
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,320
needs to know how many meals

594
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
for this specific flight your cleaning

595
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,600
crew

596
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,440
if you're doing a wide body aircraft

597
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
you're probably going to need

598
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,640
maybe two to three times as many people

599
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,039
as an air body aircraft

600
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,640
and they could be all sharing the same

601
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,799
infrastructure depending on how it's

602
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,000
set up within the airport

603
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,919
so how do you secure all the data for

604
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,559
each parts of those systems

605
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,039
those were the slides the past slides i

606
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,120
referenced was the world i was living in

607
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,400
when i was working at the airline

608
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,840
and it's a really interesting

609
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,520
problem when you think about it how to

610
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,720
keep everything secure

611
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,840
so uh before i jump into more specific

612
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
aspects of aviation cyber security

613
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
i want to spend a little time focusing

614
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,440
on

615
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,400
the aircraft when i gave this

616
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,880
presentation at a pass conference

617
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,559
people were like where's my plane

618
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,919
information i

619
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,960
wanna have the plan please don't do that

620
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,320
but i will give you a little bit of

621
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,400
background of how

622
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,039
the data domains on the aircraft are

623
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:53,679
split up

624
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,120
and what exactly exists

625
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,400
so this graphic is courtesy of connected

626
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,919
aviation today

627
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,840
and they list the domains uh in

628
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,679
criticality to safety of flight so

629
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,280
remember we're referencing safety of

630
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,840
flight again

631
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,960
so remember safety of flight and data

632
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,919
security

633
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,919
so the first domain is the aircraft

634
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,520
control domain this is the

635
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,679
most critical to safety operation of the

636
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,960
aircraft

637
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,480
including the flight control

638
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,440
applications and core cabin functions

639
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,320
next is the airline information services

640
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,400
domain or the aisd

641
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,919
more acronyms and

642
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,600
one of the best descriptions that i

643
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
found for that was from

644
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,200
iko's 2014 uh description saying that

645
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,559
it provides services and

646
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,200
interconnectivity to the other domains

647
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,400
while creating a another security permit

648
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,799
permit

649
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,360
it's too early for a saturday

650
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,320
also the isd can be categorized into two

651
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,760
subdomains so there's an

652
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,000
administrative subdomain and there's a

653
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,799
passenger

654
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,120
support sub-domain so the passengers

655
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,159
support one

656
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,279
of course supports uh pastor systems

657
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,360
and then the administrative sub-domain

658
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
includes

659
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,679
airline administrative information to

660
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:16,559
the flight deck

661
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,880
and the cabin the third one

662
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,159
is the one that you would be most

663
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,240
familiar with when you are flying

664
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,760
yourself so that would be the passenger

665
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,440
information

666
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
and entertainment services domain or

667
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,640
pi's d as

668
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,440
a lot of people call it and it's the

669
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,559
most

670
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,559
dynamic in regards to functionality

671
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,559
because we need to keep up

672
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,000
with the devices that you're bringing on

673
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,080
the plane so like how

674
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
apple just announced their new their new

675
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,520
cell phones if they had any new

676
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,000
functionality

677
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,480
you may need to have a ife system that

678
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,240
could interact with it

679
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,440
i doubt there's new functionality

680
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,200
but this includes any live

681
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,919
connectivity it could also include like

682
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:02,640
if you have one

683
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,320
if you're in happened to be in business

684
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
class and you have a fancy seat it could

685
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,000
be the seat actuators

686
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,840
um or the passenger message messaging

687
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
systems

688
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,720
all right so this is one of the reasons

689
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,919
why i really love

690
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,919
the aviation industry in regards to

691
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,080
cyber security

692
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,240
so we understand the rules that came

693
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,760
from all these awesome

694
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,440
regulatory books and i gave a highlight

695
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,960
of the ecosystem

696
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,559
and its data domains so how do we treat

697
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:36,960
this

698
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,799
unique ecosystem is it really i.t

699
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,279
information technology or is it more of

700
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,000
ot

701
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,640
operational technology when i think of

702
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,200
an ot

703
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,159
environment i see electrical grids water

704
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,279
treatment plants nuclear power plants

705
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,480
facilities that if there were a failure

706
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,760
there would be a negative impact to the

707
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
safety of human life

708
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,960
and if you happen to be an ot

709
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,919
professional sweet i am not an expert

710
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,679
hit me up on discord afterwards if

711
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,520
there's any other details you have

712
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,039
because i'd be really interested in

713
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,760
finding that out

714
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,520
so does that mean the aircraft is

715
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,600
industrial control system

716
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,360
uh not exactly but it's not your

717
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,520
traditional it system either due to the

718
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,600
safety of flight aspect

719
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,120
more of our environment

720
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,799
became open in regards to detecting

721
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,480
connectivity and

722
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,760
the more that these two areas uh

723
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,480
converge it just blurs in the middle so

724
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,720
from the avionic aspects of the aircraft

725
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,679
um

726
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,039
systems in the aircraft control domain

727
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,679
could be comparable to ot scada like

728
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,360
software if something goes wrong

729
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,760
there would be a high risk to loss of

730
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,120
life

731
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,919
similar to like a nuclear plant disaster

732
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,360
but if you think about the

733
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,559
passenger devices and the the pi's

734
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,440
domain

735
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,279
that's your i.t aspect with the latest

736
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,200
and greatest tech and software

737
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,640
that's um potentially more vulnerable

738
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,760
than your ot software so living

739
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,399
in that fuzzy gray area where it ot

740
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,559
collide is is really unique

741
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,960
and you don't see too much like that

742
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,640
and i like to phrase it as uh we're an

743
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,039
industrial control system

744
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,360
in a commercial environment with ot like

745
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,279
regulations and it needs from passengers

746
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,679
and the business so sometimes it's clear

747
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,760
as mud but it really keeps your uh

748
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,200
your day job very interesting

749
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,960
and if you're like most people that

750
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,480
originated from

751
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,120
the it world ics could be relatively new

752
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,600
to you

753
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,039
and if you want to learn about it

754
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,559
there's some cool free web-based

755
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,559
trainings brought to you by

756
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,600
dhs and it's up to you

757
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,480
if you want to give them your

758
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
information because i think you have to

759
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
give like an email address and your

760
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,720
your first and last name but you give

761
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,159
your info and you get the

762
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,240
a lot of cool information from these

763
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,720
classes

764
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,320
all right this is my favorite part of

765
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,559
the presentation that i lovingly like to

766
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,440
call

767
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,000
aviation unicorns so i wanted to provide

768
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,720
a few unique use cases that i have seen

769
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,640
and or experienced when i was in

770
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,880
industry that sets uh

771
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,600
aviation apart from typical i.t and ot

772
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,158
environments

773
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,600
software patching and upgrades back when

774
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,279
i worked at panasonic this is something

775
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,960
i personally experienced so

776
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,799
it was very important to have

777
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,600
a good communication path with your

778
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,039
customers

779
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,159
for example if we needed to get

780
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,320
either a patch out or a software upgrade

781
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,360
and it

782
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,200
didn't matter if it was security related

783
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,480
the teams were always

784
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,320
we'd go into major crunch if we had to

785
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,159
to make sure the software was properly

786
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,039
tested

787
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,279
and bundled in the appropriate way that

788
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,799
it could be handed to the customer in

789
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,760
less than a day

790
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,640
if we needed to yay for processes

791
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,320
because we were able to

792
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,360
recreate all of our stringent guidelines

793
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,120
and make sure that the software was in

794
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,279
the right state when it was released

795
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,279
so we'd hand over the soft software to

796
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,760
the customer

797
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,840
and the customer owns the system so we

798
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,960
have no control

799
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,080
over when it would get updated

800
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,000
because we don't own the aircraft and

801
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,520
every airline is different

802
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,960
so how did we overcome that uniqueness

803
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,520
in our industry you need to have great

804
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,960
communication

805
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,760
and there's so many segments in the

806
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,200
supply chain

807
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,520
being able to know who you need to

808
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,919
involve is very important

809
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,039
so if you compare that to it

810
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,279
and you think of your cell phone again

811
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,200
software updates get pushed

812
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,799
and eventually your phone's gonna get

813
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:09,440
locked

814
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,840
if you don't upgrade we all see that we

815
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,120
all say yeah we agree

816
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,000
to whatever updates they're gonna do you

817
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,360
don't want that to happen on your

818
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,240
aircraft

819
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,120
especially in an ot environment what's

820
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,960
nice is that operators

821
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
have the luxury to make updates based

822
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,159
off of recommendations of the

823
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,360
manufacturer

824
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,520
and they have compensating controls in

825
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,480
place too

826
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,360
to say you know what if we're not going

827
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,559
to do this update

828
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,200
we have controls xyz in place until we

829
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,600
can do this update

830
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,080
so if if it was that closed environment

831
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,919
that has no internet connectivity

832
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,600
it might be okay to wait to do that type

833
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,919
of an update but more importantly the

834
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:48,960
system owner

835
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,080
has that option so how do we

836
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,600
combat against that in this unique

837
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,760
situation

838
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,600
i'm going to refer to defense in depth

839
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,360
again

840
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,000
so for instance the hardware

841
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,519
only allows certain software packages to

842
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,600
be loaded to it it's it's looking for

843
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,159
that

844
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,360
the software is signed and uh roots of

845
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,519
trust exist

846
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,799
more importantly the uh aircraft

847
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,000
is an embedded system it's not an open

848
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,360
operating system that's caught off the

849
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,720
shelf

850
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,960
the hardware is more robust as well in

851
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,320
that if

852
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,000
you see that it's running lennox or what

853
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,440
a lennox or some

854
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
type of common operating system it

855
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,120
really is not it's severely stripped

856
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,240
down

857
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,760
and for example the software can only be

858
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,519
loaded

859
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,960
via an official manual push to

860
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,320
the aircraft subcomponent so there's a

861
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,519
lot of different

862
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,000
items in place to make sure that there's

863
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,799
additional checks

864
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,799
all right the ever expanding attack

865
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,640
surface

866
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,679
since uh iot

867
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,120
technology has been incorporated

868
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
it's drastically changed our attack

869
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,559
surface because the

870
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,840
aircraft was designed to be a closed

871
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,320
system initially but due to its long

872
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,600
life span

873
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,679
new technology continues to be added we

874
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,440
want that new functionality

875
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,720
uh when we fly and the moment we added

876
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,440
satcom

877
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,240
and internet connectivity everything

878
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,960
exploded

879
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,880
as we've seen through hacking claims

880
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,919
and the first time i learned

881
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,200
about how interesting iot was i was

882
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,799
actually at a conference

883
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,120
and the speaker was talking about a

884
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,840
wi-fi

885
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,159
water kettle and i am an avid tea

886
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,840
drinker as i've been holding my mug the

887
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,279
whole time

888
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,320
and the wi-fi kettle and similar devices

889
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,159
are just an unsecure

890
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,399
entry vector into your home network and

891
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,880
luckily when you compare that back to

892
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,519
the

893
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,240
aircraft it's an embed system with

894
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,760
defense in depth and there are

895
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,480
several safeguards so when you think of

896
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,720
iot it's not really comparing it

897
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,080
apples to apples so for example

898
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,120
uh experience i had the usb ports on the

899
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,799
aircraft

900
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,640
though you may see a lot of them several

901
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,399
of them have been

902
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,399
they've had wires clipped in it so that

903
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,440
it's power only

904
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,640
the data's physically been turned off

905
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,840
via that wire clipping

906
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
so the main point i want to make for

907
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,720
this one is just that

908
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,360
iot is something that the industry

909
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,480
really cares about

910
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,919
it's on their radar and they know that

911
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,039
they're going to have to increase their

912
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,440
scope to accommodate that and

913
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,640
back when i i worked at american

914
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,200
the scope of our team was aviation cyber

915
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,240
security and

916
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,320
internet of things technology so they

917
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,519
were looking at that

918
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,519
uh software patching and upgrades

919
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,560
so when i talked about this topic it was

920
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,800
interesting i got called out in person

921
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,480
on stage

922
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,839
because someone cut me off early so

923
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,879
the great thing about virtual

924
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,639
conferences is that i get to talk about

925
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,359
it first

926
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,560
and that doesn't happen but it's an

927
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,679
awesome segue

928
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,159
into a potential future state of what's

929
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,599
being discussed which are

930
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,599
over-the-air updates so depending on the

931
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,800
software

932
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,560
that you're trying to update and load it

933
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,320
could take minutes to hours

934
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,159
to load an update and in

935
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,839
in the industry when a plane isn't

936
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,280
flying because it's either out of

937
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,960
service or you're doing updates or

938
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,918
maintenance

939
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,239
uh that's bad because you're not flying

940
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,679
you're not transporting passengers

941
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,599
so the thought process was if a car can

942
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,679
do an over-the-air update why not a

943
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,560
plane

944
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,599
well there are multiple reasons

945
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,079
first there are initial talks that if

946
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,160
this were to happen it would be

947
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,280
in the pi's d space so the passenger

948
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,880
domain space

949
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,280
you definitely do not want to do this on

950
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,400
an avionics or

951
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,640
a critical system in the aircraft

952
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,680
control domain

953
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,280
while in flight because there are

954
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,079
specific items listed that you need to

955
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:18,880
have

956
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,720
testing and verification that the

957
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,560
software was loaded correctly

958
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,880
it's signed off on it's it's not taken

959
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,839
lightly at all

960
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,839
that you would want to do that over the

961
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,240
air

962
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,920
but if you compare that to your flight

963
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,359
entertainment system if it doesn't

964
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,960
update properly

965
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,440
the system could be shut down the

966
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,960
unfortunate that the passengers don't

967
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,400
get to use the system

968
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,359
uh whether it be purchasing items or

969
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,800
whatnot

970
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,480
but depending on the airline's risk

971
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,200
tolerance that may or may not be okay

972
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,880
so it's it's up to uh the business case

973
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,680
of of that airline in that specific

974
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,480
instance

975
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,920
so for instance how much revenue are you

976
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,640
willing to lose

977
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,760
more robust system that's backwards

978
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,359
compatible and that can fail over

979
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,560
gracefully

980
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,119
if the update happens to not work so all

981
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,079
of those things

982
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,200
are items to think about but

983
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,440
once it becomes successful in one

984
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,720
aircraft a proof of concept

985
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,920
there i i see that it's probably going

986
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,560
to creep

987
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,480
into the other domains but luckily

988
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,800
we have the stringent safety standards

989
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,240
and anything that happens in the

990
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,839
aviation industry does not happen

991
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,800
overnight it is

992
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,839
very very slow and there's a lot of

993
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,839
steps in between to make sure that items

994
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,680
are properly vetted

995
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,440
and all of the players i mentioned in

996
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,599
the aviation ecosystem

997
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,800
get to speak on whether or not they

998
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,119
they agree with that because we all work

999
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,720
together with our suppliers

1000
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,480
our oems so it's

1001
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,839
something to be aware of and to

1002
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,119
to i'm i try to keep an open mind

1003
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,280
but i wouldn't be afraid of

1004
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,880
jumping on a plane right now and having

1005
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,800
those types of updates be a concern

1006
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,359
all right so how do you deal with all

1007
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,359
these awesome aviation unicorns

1008
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,280
that uh spin out spit out

1009
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,040
vulnerabilities and threats as opposed

1010
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,400
to awesome pretty

1011
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,560
rainbows and it's it's something simple

1012
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,920
that people may not think about but it's

1013
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,800
just having

1014
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,680
constant communication with common goals

1015
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,000
so

1016
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,160
one of the one of the reasons i loved

1017
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,760
working in that industry and it was one

1018
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,839
of the hardest things

1019
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,960
to step back was that every security

1020
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,359
team

1021
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,920
regardless of what organization you're

1022
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,599
in has the same goal

1023
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,640
we care about the the safety the privacy

1024
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,720
and the security of our passengers

1025
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,160
and their data when they're traveling

1026
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
with us so back

1027
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,200
i was talking on a daily basis with my

1028
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,160
competitors

1029
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,960
with my manufacturers and suppliers to

1030
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,079
make sure that

1031
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,839
we were all in the loop when it came to

1032
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,839
current and future threats and what we

1033
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:12,640
could do

1034
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,040
to improve processes best practices

1035
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,680
anything

1036
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,040
in our space and i i thought it was

1037
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,160
unique

1038
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,640
to be an environment where you're

1039
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,320
working with your competitors and it's

1040
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,119
a non-compute type of atmosphere so if

1041
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,880
you're lucky enough to be in that type

1042
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
of environment too

1043
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,760
it's it's really cool and

1044
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,880
it makes perfect sense but when you

1045
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,320
think about it at the end of the day an

1046
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,760
attack or threat to one

1047
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,839
player in the ecosystem is an impact to

1048
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,240
everybody

1049
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,480
so how is that done it's through

1050
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,760
information sharing

1051
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,560
and there are great organizations that

1052
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,920
already exist

1053
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,640
that allow this to happen so the

1054
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,920
aviation isac

1055
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
is one of my favorites it's the

1056
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,240
information sharing and analysis center

1057
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,800
and then there's also iota like who i

1058
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,680
referenced earlier

1059
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,320
so through those organizations and

1060
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,839
individual companies

1061
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,480
the industry is just growing to to

1062
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,839
better engage

1063
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,119
the research community and this is one i

1064
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,480
really like to harp on

1065
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,200
with my counterparts in when i was back

1066
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,720
in the industry

1067
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,400
because more importantly we need to do

1068
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,720
better there

1069
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,119
has been signs of progress so there's a

1070
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,800
lot more aviation companies that are

1071
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,760
offering

1072
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,280
bug bounty programs and vulnerability

1073
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,359
disclosure programs um

1074
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,640
for those who attended defcon i

1075
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,560
i took a break from hacker summer camp

1076
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,960
this uh this past summer

1077
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,000
but we're seeing more engagement so when

1078
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,720
the

1079
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,520
aviation village now aerospace village

1080
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,240
came up

1081
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,720
that was a great step forward um

1082
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,599
but the flip side too from the industry

1083
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,119
standpoint is

1084
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,440
testing on an aircraft is is a common

1085
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,040
concern and

1086
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,319
we know that testing on aircraft

1087
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,839
shouldn't happen because it's not

1088
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,800
safe but doing nothing is also not

1089
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,760
acceptable

1090
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,040
so how can we be curious while being

1091
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,760
safe

1092
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,119
and supporting both sides

1093
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,560
back to you to goodall regulation and i

1094
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,319
think it is specifically

1095
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,680
uh 355. you need to prove that systems

1096
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,400
are secure

1097
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,640
and testing is one way of validation so

1098
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,240
all the parties need to work together

1099
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,560
and i'm looking forward to

1100
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,040
coming back to the aerospace village as

1101
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,560
a

1102
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,839
potential somewhat neutral third party

1103
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,599
uh and and come with my uh research hat

1104
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,640
on to see how we can continue to

1105
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,240
improve uh the way that we're testing

1106
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,000
these systems

1107
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,680
uh the other item i like to support a

1108
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,319
lot

1109
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,960
is that i have a constant issue of

1110
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,240
a lack of trained cyber security

1111
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,319
professionals and it's in general it

1112
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,680
doesn't matter what industry that you're

1113
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,160
in

1114
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,640
but to make it even more complex is that

1115
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,839
you you need a certain specialty to

1116
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,240
understand how all this works together

1117
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,400
uh in the aviation ecosystem and that in

1118
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,599
itself is a unicorn of a person

1119
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,400
and in order to to build that up we need

1120
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,760
to train the next set of professionals

1121
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,040
you just can't say

1122
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,960
i i hate the job descriptions where it's

1123
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,160
like it's kind of

1124
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,119
entry level but we want this experience

1125
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,560
but how do you get this experience

1126
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,480
there's not a class you can take right

1127
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,359
now

1128
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,720
for for aviation cyber security that's

1129
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,079
um in theory open to the public

1130
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,160
so word where do you start off if you're

1131
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,359
new

1132
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,319
my recommendation if you're really new

1133
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:56,560
is

1134
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,480
everything that i mentioned in this

1135
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,599
presentation

1136
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,839
go back read those articles do your

1137
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:02,880
initial homework

1138
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,960
because one thing i've noticed uh back

1139
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,920
when i supported

1140
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,839
a bug bounty program is that if we had a

1141
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,040
researcher

1142
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,000
that provided information that said you

1143
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,920
know what i found this vulnerability

1144
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,200
i know it may not be um applicable

1145
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,079
because of so and so standard or we know

1146
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,520
you have these safety things in there

1147
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,079
but we want to make you aware of this as

1148
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,040
it sort of

1149
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,480
it makes you look knowledgeable that you

1150
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,640
did your homework at first

1151
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,319
is one one bit of advice

1152
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,839
and with that i'm going to just

1153
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,240
prove is in the pudding of all said

1154
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,040
references

1155
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,760
and once again this is on my website as

1156
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,079
well

1157
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,560
so don't massively screenshot right now

1158
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,079
but i really want to thank everyone for

1159
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,400
for attending this presentation on a

1160
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,520
saturday morning i know it could be

1161
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,839
nice to sleep in and whatnot but i hope

1162
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:58,720
it gave you

1163
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,319
a little bit of insight into the world

1164
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,079
of aviation cyber security and that it

1165
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,680
sparked your interest

1166
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,440
i i want to leave you with the feeling

1167
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
that the aviation industry

1168
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,280
really cares about the cyber security

1169
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,880
mission and

1170
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,160
they want to continue to uh work with

1171
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,960
the research community so

1172
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,680
keep pinging us please don't have

1173
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,200
complaints

1174
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,640
and uh more importantly let's keep the

1175
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,680
conversation going so uh

1176
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,200
the top one's my twitter handle if

1177
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,280
you're on discord uh

1178
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,560
that's my number for discord uh

1179
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,839
i'm not gonna lie i'm i'm on discord

1180
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,720
infrequently so ping me on twitter most

1181
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,280
of all

1182
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,680
or through my website and if you have a

1183
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,440
minute or two i'd really appreciate it

1184
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,839
if you could give some feedback

1185
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:55,839
via my survey

1186
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,839
you
