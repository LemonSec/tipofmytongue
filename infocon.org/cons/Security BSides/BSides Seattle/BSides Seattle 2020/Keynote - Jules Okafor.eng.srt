00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,320
i am so happy to be here

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,440
um thanks so much to b-side seattle josh

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,480
and hugh for

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,239
you know getting me to this talk um i

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,240
one of the things i'll say just off the

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,320
bat is i'm so glad

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,199
that i do not have to be up and speaking

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,800
at 9 a.m seattle time

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,760
i'm actually in my home in columbus ohio

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,519
and it's about noon

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,920
um but what i want to talk to you today

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,880
is about

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,200
this idea of centering security around

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,239
humans

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,079
um and it's it's a really really um

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,600
personal and very passion oriented

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,320
subject for me uh mainly because of who

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,600
i am and what i do

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,399
and so it's probably important that i

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,480
share with you a little bit about myself

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,600
so i am julia covfor i'm the ceo and

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,680
founder of revolution cyber

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,480
and uh my company focuses on user

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,039
behavior

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,080
risk management and modification and

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,280
you're probably wondering what that

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
means and a lot of people do

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
but essentially what what what

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,840
my job is as a security professional is

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
to get into the minds of

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,119
you know people of users and i've been

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,799
very weird about this idea of

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,680
hacking the human or hacking the human

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,479
mind

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,720
um you know i i just don't believe in

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
that but ultimately what i feel like is

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,280
we've got to gain a better understanding

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,520
in order for us to really focus on risk

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
and compliance and do what it is that we

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,159
are

42
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,759
um supposed to do as cyber security

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,119
professionals we need to better

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,000
understand

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the people who we're working for and the

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,600
people who we serve

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,960
so i'll give you a little bit of a

48
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,720
background about myself and i'm not even

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,399
going to focus on the professional piece

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,200
i want to focus

51
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
on the personal elements because that'll

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,920
be critical to what we discussed today

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,479
um

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,600
i am a um a

55
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,640
human empath so i don't know

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,719
if anybody in the audience is an empath

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,040
but i'm somebody who connects on a very

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,159
visceral

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,639
and spiritual emotional connection with

60
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,598
other people

61
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,080
um and i have this ability to really

62
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,879
feel

63
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,480
how other people feel um and it makes it

64
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
so that i have these great connections

65
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,280
with other human beings

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
but it also makes it so i can often feel

67
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,560
very overwhelmed

68
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,879
um and so one of the other traits that i

69
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,840
have is that i

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,879
tend to be a highly sensitive person um

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,120
and so i am i i get overstimulated

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,879
and then i tend to um need to be

73
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,640
re-energized so i've got to spend a lot

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,920
of time uh

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,160
alone and really figuring out what the

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,840
things are that are like draining my

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
energy sources

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,800
and i'm also adhd so i've got um

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,720
attention deficit disorder i've had it

80
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,160
since i was a kid

81
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,440
they they uh they um diagnosed me in law

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,080
school

83
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,959
because everybody else in my class was

84
00:02:58,959 --> 00:02:59,680
able to

85
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,920
you know digest these large books in

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,599
such a record number of time and i

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,640
struggled with it

88
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,800
and i was diagnosed at that time and had

89
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
no idea that i had this problem because

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,920
i'd done pretty well

91
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,319
previous to that um but i but i also

92
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,159
found out that i was neuro-diverse

93
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,080
there was just a way that i thought that

94
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
most people did not and

95
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,920
all of that is kind of revealed in all

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,519
the things i just mentioned

97
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,480
so i've had a very very interesting

98
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,480
foray into cyber security

99
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,280
um started in sales i started as an

100
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,080
account executive about six years ago

101
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,760
helped to build out build out the first

102
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
stock in um

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,879
the bank of zambia zeroco and i've also

104
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,360
managed really large scale teams um

105
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,239
sales teams

106
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,640
in the philippines india and and really

107
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,560
across the globe um also working in

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,720
tanzania and south africa

109
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,879
but one of the things that you know my

110
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,000
time

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,280
in cyber security has taught me is that

112
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,640
there's a lot of benefit to what we do

113
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,599
in fact so many people that i know just

114
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,760
like you are drained by how much there

115
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,879
is to do

116
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,680
um you could spend 24 hours doing your

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,159
job

118
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,439
and really never get to the uh

119
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,120
the end of it there's always more work

120
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
to be done but one of the biggest areas

121
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
that i found

122
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,160
um inside of security is that we were

123
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
missing the reason why i felt like a lot

124
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,600
of the burnout was happening is that we

125
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
were focusing so heavily on technology

126
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,880
we were focusing so heavily on building

127
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,960
out security operations programs

128
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,199
security operation centers what is it to

129
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,720
do penetration testing

130
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,320
that we have never really started to

131
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,000
really think about

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,759
what the purpose is of what we were

133
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,199
doing and who

134
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,960
is it that we were trying to benefit i

135
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,800
think you know when i joined the

136
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,120
um the security space about six years

137
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,960
ago one of the biggest

138
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,840
um values that i was able to offer both

139
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,360
my clients to my customers

140
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,320
was i was able to talk them through the

141
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,040
value

142
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
of cyber security the benefit of

143
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
penetrating penetration testing systems

144
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,080
the um

145
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,759
the impact of having operations that

146
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,440
included the business operations

147
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
processes of the

148
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,320
broader parts of the business and over

149
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,280
and over again

150
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,600
one of the biggest things i found is we

151
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
were rarely ever considering

152
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,560
the people in which this had to work for

153
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,199
right

154
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,400
so people in organizations people like

155
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,840
myself who are

156
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,880
you know either um they're busy

157
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,520
they're distracted they are um

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
overwhelmed

159
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,360
they have still a job to do that has

160
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
nothing at all to do with cyber security

161
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,440
and one of the questions i found that

162
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,360
people were not answering is

163
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,680
why do these people even care why would

164
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,280
anybody care

165
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,960
that the organization is at risk is it

166
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,919
my job to protect an entire organization

167
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,080
and why would a hacker come after me i'm

168
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
just this little person

169
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
that question is asked by individuals

170
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
over and over again

171
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
and yet in order for us as cyber

172
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
security professionals to design

173
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,400
you know effective programs to build out

174
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,440
world-class

175
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,639
um you know uh technology

176
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,639
we have to gain an understanding of the

177
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,560
humans behind the system

178
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,720
and i think that remains one of the

179
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,000
biggest areas of threat for

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,960
us in cyber security and the reason why

181
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,720
i thought to bring it to you guys today

182
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,560
in this keynote is because i really

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,840
wanted us to start to

184
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,440
dive into a new way by which to filter

185
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,680
this idea of cyber security

186
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,759
i wanted us to really focus on what i

187
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,520
perceive and what i'm hoping you will

188
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,400
start to perceive

189
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
as soon as the biggest threat to cyber

190
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,560
security it's the human

191
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,280
in the middle and why why am i praying

192
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,960
off the man in the middle

193
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,280
we security people have our own language

194
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
our own lingo we talk to each other and

195
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,479
it makes sense to us

196
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,840
but we're often talking in you know

197
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840
zeros and ones as it relates to the

198
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,599
broader business i mean

199
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,400
really um what we're very good at is

200
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,360
coming up with new

201
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,400
cool tech new cool uh um

202
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
language and and and and things that we

203
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,680
say to each other

204
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,199
which makes sense to us but in the end

205
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,120
we've got to start to

206
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,080
shift the way we communicate shift the

207
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,520
way we think about this

208
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,759
big threat and start to talk more

209
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,360
directly to the humans

210
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,599
that are in the middle of any process

211
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,400
program

212
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,680
or system that we actually build so

213
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,919
the points i want to discuss for uh for

214
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,280
us today is

215
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,560
um human centered design and um my

216
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,280
background

217
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,319
is as an attorney i i have not been a

218
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,120
designer

219
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,400
i have not been um just on the surface

220
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,560
someone who focused heavily on the way

221
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,479
in which things were built

222
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,960
i'm not an engineer but what i am is

223
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,720
somebody who had to

224
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,120
in the way i operated with regard to

225
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
sales and marketing

226
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,360
focus very heavily on what the end

227
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,879
result would be

228
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,840
what factors were being considered by

229
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,560
the

230
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,879
person who used it and i had to figure

231
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,560
out the real world applications of

232
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,599
technology

233
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,560
so i feel like i'm best suited having

234
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,840
designed

235
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,879
in my career several large-scale

236
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,319
security platforms

237
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,360
and programs for companies that are

238
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,000
global

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,199
2000 companies um in addition to really

240
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,800
small mid-sized businesses that don't

241
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
have a lot of budget so

242
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,360
we're going to talk about human centered

243
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,039
design we're going to talk about its

244
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,159
applications

245
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,559
the challenges that we have in sort of

246
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,279
you know

247
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,839
having us all center around the idea

248
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,559
around it

249
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,880
and finally i want to talk to you guys

250
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,799
through that cyber revolution what does

251
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,480
the future look like for cyber security

252
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,040
so this idea of human centered design it

253
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,519
means accepting the humanity

254
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,480
and therefore the inmate ingenuity and

255
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,839
insolubility of technology users

256
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,560
it is i find it disappointing over and

257
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,760
over again when i hear

258
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,920
um professionals uh infrastruct

259
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,959
professionals saying

260
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,399
you know users are stupid um they're not

261
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,200
you know they they get in the way um

262
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
often i hear that

263
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,000
you know they they just want to do the

264
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,279
same things over and over again and they

265
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,279
don't care

266
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,360
that may be true i'm not gonna go ahead

267
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,560
and tell you that most people

268
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,800
they care everyone cares um that's not

269
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,680
true

270
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,560
not not all humans not all employees not

271
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,279
all users

272
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,600
don't care i think one of the things

273
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,040
that we need to keep in mind

274
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,600
as it relates to risk is the biggest

275
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,399
risks

276
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,680
are attributed to and created by

277
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,880
humans and so as we look at this idea of

278
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,000
cyber risk

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,320
without the idea of the people who

280
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,399
actually create the risk we miss a

281
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,920
huge part of where the actual uh

282
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,440
opportunity exists for us

283
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,440
right we can continue to build great

284
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,880
technologies and systems

285
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,959
but if we're not thinking about the end

286
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,959
user the user experience

287
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,360
how it will be used we are missing an

288
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,720
opportunity to create

289
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,880
and impact the way in which cyber

290
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,480
security works in the real world

291
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
and we're actually hindering the

292
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,920
performance

293
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,360
so when we talk about human centered

294
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
design i also think about this idea of

295
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,760
system design right

296
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,240
so how do the disparate part of a

297
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,839
program come together

298
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,800
and if you think about the human being

299
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,399
where do they sit in the middle

300
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,399
and as they sit in the middle how do

301
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,440
they impact the various parts

302
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,480
so when i think about users when i think

303
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,880
about

304
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,959
employees if we're talking about a

305
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,399
business or government or government

306
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,440
workers or even

307
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,760
people in their homes i think about the

308
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,800
fact that

309
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
when you really think about the human

310
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,800
mind people are smarter than we give

311
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,600
them credit for what i'll tell you is

312
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,720
if you create an obstacle it is human

313
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,519
nature

314
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,560
for someone to try to get around it it

315
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:54,800
is

316
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,399
natural for people to want to ignore it

317
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,839
it is quite um possible that any

318
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,320
security control you put in place

319
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,720
some human will figure out how to bypass

320
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,440
the thing

321
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,839
and really that's what we call hacking

322
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,440
so if you think about the people who are

323
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,240
hacking

324
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,880
or you know the the black hat hackers

325
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
they tend to be

326
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,240
really knowledgeable about how the human

327
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,519
mind works as well

328
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,360
and they're very good about

329
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
surreptitiously going around security

330
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,399
controls

331
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,000
so if you think about the fact that on

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
the other side of a breach

333
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
or an incident or a system is a human

334
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,079
being

335
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,040
attempting to get into a system then

336
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,480
it's important for us when we're

337
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,839
thinking about design

338
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,760
to think about the human being who might

339
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
be getting into our systems

340
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,880
and also the human beings who would be

341
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,800
using the systems and figuring out

342
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
how do we mitigate via technology be a

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,959
process

344
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,600
be a policy the ways in which that human

345
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,320
being

346
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,920
has the ability to get around to avoid

347
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,040
or to ignore

348
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,000
uh security control if we think about

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
that on a broader scale

350
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
we have the ability to to start to

351
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,360
really

352
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,079
dig into and start to address the

353
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,279
reasons why

354
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,760
uh security controls in cyber security

355
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,480
despite

356
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,240
all of the investment is just not

357
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,399
working it requires us to take a new

358
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,279
approach and

359
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,760
i'm suggesting and i recommend strongly

360
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,639
that we focus on human centered design

361
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,160
humans and design the technical

362
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,639
definition is it's a process mindset and

363
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,279
approach

364
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,560
to solving complex problems once i

365
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,000
joined this industry one of the

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,120
first things i said to myself was if

367
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,200
you know i'm a problem solver i i don't

368
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
see that what we're doing

369
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
is any different than when you know

370
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,200
uh people first started to get into uh

371
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,480
you know pharmaceuticals if you think

372
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,079
about the way a pharmaceutical company

373
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:50,800
works

374
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,839
it's designed to create medicine

375
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,880
that solves ailments that solves disease

376
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,839
you know like vaccines the work that we

377
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,560
do

378
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,160
is complex as well the the difference is

379
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,079
the problems we're solving often can't

380
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,880
be seen until the bad thing happens

381
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,360
so what we're trying to build with

382
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,160
regard to

383
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,120
our cyber security are solutions that

384
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,160
anticipate

385
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,800
the way in which a behavior might happen

386
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
that might cause an impact that would

387
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,519
negatively

388
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,320
impact a system or an asset and this can

389
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,240
be very complex because it's not just

390
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,440
what i'm telling you

391
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,560
it is in the context of a business it is

392
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,200
a

393
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,920
phishing email it is an employee who

394
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,600
perhaps is socially engineered

395
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,839
it is an asset that has vulnerabilities

396
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,279
that have not been patched

397
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,680
it is two different departments with

398
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,720
shared data

399
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,320
that don't have the right policies

400
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,600
attached to them and therefore data is

401
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
being leaked outside the organization

402
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,199
these problems are these problems exist

403
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,839
they're dynamic ever-changing and it

404
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,959
requires us to have

405
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,320
a cyber mindset and my thought process

406
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,720
is

407
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,880
that a cyber mindset is really

408
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,240
entrenched in this idea of

409
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,399
human-centered design

410
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,560
and what we have to do in the space that

411
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,440
we exist

412
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,920
is to empower individuals to design new

413
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,800
products

414
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,040
new services and systems that address

415
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,320
what the core needs are

416
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,600
for the people who identify a problem

417
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,680
so let's let's break that down a bit

418
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,639
cyber security using human-centered

419
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,839
design

420
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,920
should be about the empowerment and the

421
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,800
enablement of people it should be about

422
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,920
technology

423
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,639
that is only built to enable the

424
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,240
performance of people in doing their

425
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,120
jobs

426
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
for instance the the purpose of a sim

427
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,279
when it was initially uh built and you

428
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,440
know we'll all argue about whether sims

429
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,760
are

430
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,360
aren't valuable whether they check a box

431
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
or don't check a box but the idea was

432
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,320
you wanted to create a technology that

433
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,839
was able to notify

434
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,680
an organization of possible um intrusion

435
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,680
or other threats to the organization

436
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
now initially when those were built the

437
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,120
idea was

438
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,399
very was very simple it was if people

439
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,360
know

440
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,440
when something goes wrong and they're

441
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,639
notified then they can respond

442
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,519
that's great but a human centered design

443
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,199
approach and i think a lot of sims are

444
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,040
moving in that direction they're moving

445
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,160
into this idea that it is not just about

446
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,519
the notification

447
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,920
that something happens we also want

448
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,880
correlation

449
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,399
we want to make sure that the

450
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,480
information we're giving is accurate

451
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,959
we want to think about um the reduction

452
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,800
of noise too many alerts

453
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,959
so that it's the idea of are we

454
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,639
notifying about the right thing at the

455
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,680
right time

456
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,079
and who is the person to whom should

457
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:44,800
respond

458
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,680
in that situation the other idea of

459
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,440
human centered design is that

460
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,120
we want to ask ourselves where does the

461
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,680
film

462
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,800
fit as it relates to people process

463
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,519
and technology and if you think about a

464
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,560
sim

465
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,480
the idea is who has access to that sim

466
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,600
what my what monitoring um uh end point

467
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,759
or is it detecting from what parts of

468
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,120
the business perhaps

469
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,800
and then you also want to think about

470
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,399
what should the response be if something

471
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,680
bad happens

472
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,000
human centered design actually pulls

473
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,639
into focus this idea of a system design

474
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,880
the idea that nothing we're doing should

475
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,000
be isolated

476
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,399
and that every person on the team their

477
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,399
contribution to that team is valuable

478
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,800
because in order for each technology and

479
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,839
tool to work

480
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,839
it must be done in alignment with other

481
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,959
humans

482
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,959
and i think the more cyber security

483
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,399
begins to focus

484
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,160
on this idea that um it is about

485
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,959
human the human element it is about

486
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,240
human error

487
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,320
and mitigating that but more importantly

488
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,639
it is about human and system design

489
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,199
and this um combination of human and

490
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,720
technology working together

491
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,680
synchronistically

492
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,680
so part of why um you know i joined

493
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,399
cyber and

494
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,520
part of why i stay you know i you know i

495
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,559
am part of a community of

496
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,799
wonderful cyber security experts and

497
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,160
every day i hear

498
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,439
over and over again um about

499
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,319
how hard it is to do the work we do and

500
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,439
how little

501
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,000
we are appreciated for the work we do

502
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,439
and i'll tell you

503
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,559
the reason why people security is

504
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,600
is really understood uh by those outside

505
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,080
of it

506
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,919
is that we often don't um

507
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,520
we often the thing if we're doing

508
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,600
security well people don't even know

509
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,559
that we exist

510
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,960
i mean really we want to stay out of the

511
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,799
way but we want to

512
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,080
guys it's a very difficult job and

513
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,640
part of what i've seen in terms of

514
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,240
organizations being able to

515
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,160
bring security to the forefront because

516
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,679
i believe when enterprises bring

517
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,039
security to the forefront

518
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,919
it reduces the load on us to justify

519
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:58,799
ourselves

520
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,240
and that can be so painful um and so

521
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,120
what i'm also i'm always asking us to

522
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,320
think about as we do our jobs are

523
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,200
how do we focus what we do on people

524
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,000
right

525
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,039
and that requires us to leave the

526
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,320
security team

527
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,400
to leave the security department and to

528
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
go in and have conversations with the

529
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,840
users themselves

530
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,000
and i'm not even going to tell you that

531
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,360
it's fun it is not

532
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,400
fun i do that on a daily basis and on

533
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,320
one hand if you're an extrovert it can

534
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:30,640
be

535
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,559
a good time it refreshes you it

536
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,760
rejuvenates you

537
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,679
but i'm more of an ambivert so i would

538
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,280
say that it can be

539
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,880
draining but our jobs and

540
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
there are very few security people that

541
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,600
i find that don't want to do a good job

542
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,080
and oftentimes when they have the

543
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,360
conversations

544
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,280
with the production team if they're

545
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,960
going out into the lab

546
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,720
if they're talking to the to the users

547
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,160
while they're working at home

548
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,520
or in on the go they find out a great

549
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,720
deal about

550
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,960
ways in which to do security better and

551
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,559
i think that's all this is about

552
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,760
is how do we do security better how can

553
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,080
we improve upon what we know what we're

554
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,320
doing but ultimately in the grand scheme

555
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,240
of things isn't working

556
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,600
um what what i found is that

557
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,880
80 86 of breaches are

558
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,919
today financially motivated right so

559
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,480
people

560
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,240
are um are taking part in breaches

561
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,480
for the fact of making money selling

562
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,520
data getting

563
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,320
access to particular systems how much of

564
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
that goes into the way in which we build

565
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,640
out

566
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,039
our program how much of that do we take

567
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,960
into consideration when we are building

568
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,720
out awareness programs

569
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,760
um how often do we talk about this when

570
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,080
we're

571
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,840
buying technology if we know that people

572
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
are behalf of the humans on the other

573
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
side are really looking to get access to

574
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
data for the purpose of leveraging it

575
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,600
for financial reasons

576
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,200
what part of that is going into the

577
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,880
strategies that we're using

578
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,320
you know as we're doing penetration

579
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,000
testing right so if i

580
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,400
am a penetration tester and i'm thinking

581
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,000
my job is to secure

582
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,159
our systems then what i want to do is

583
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,880
put myself in the position of the hacker

584
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,520
right if i'm going to do penetration

585
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
testing better i should know the mindset

586
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,960
of the person who might

587
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,360
do the hacking because that's in fact

588
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,720
what a penetration test is

589
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,559
it really is your ability to test the

590
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,720
system the way a hacker might

591
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,679
so we've got to really understand why

592
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,360
something's happening i think too often

593
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,400
we're missing that

594
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,240
as a function of the conversations we're

595
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,679
having

596
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,039
we need to really stop and think about

597
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,960
the humans that are in cyber security

598
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,400
because we are not

599
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,840
being hacked by bots on ever on the side

600
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,960
of every bot

601
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,120
is a human being who is pushing the

602
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,960
button or is actually

603
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,840
um writing the command right so i just

604
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,360
want us to kind of think through that i

605
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,919
think

606
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,880
we we we have this we're in this great

607
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
place i think with cyber security today

608
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,200
where i think that we have an

609
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,240
opportunity to build a

610
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,280
a future that is designed around

611
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,960
that is designed to secure from the

612
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
beginning it is designed it is by design

613
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,240
that we take into consideration the

614
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
human elements of things and i think we

615
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,720
stop

616
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,280
and sit back and say what are the parts

617
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,840
of

618
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,520
the way we do our work that we could do

619
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,760
better and i think the next step is that

620
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,480
human element

621
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,159
so as i was preparing for this i started

622
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,240
to think about ways in which i had

623
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,400
leveraged you know this idea of human

624
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,760
centered design

625
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,080
and um about five years ago

626
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,480
i mentioned that i built out um with a

627
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,640
team with our security operations team

628
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,080
um an alien ball splunk integration

629
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,240
um that was the basis for a security

630
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,280
operation center

631
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,400
at the bank of naco um

632
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,480
to do that so i was responsible for

633
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
selling the solution

634
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,520
um and effectively in order to sell the

635
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,960
solution i had to understand the

636
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,000
different

637
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,960
parts of it and part of what was

638
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,799
different about this solution is that it

639
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,960
had to operate in zambia

640
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,159
and i am not from zambia and so

641
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,080
when we started to work together with

642
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,679
the customer and we started to think

643
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,039
about the solution

644
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,600
we came across several challenges one of

645
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,159
the challenges was latency uh because

646
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,240
they didn't have steady internet and

647
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,919
steady um electricity

648
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,440
we had to figure out if we were to

649
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,320
build this solution in zombie if we were

650
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
to transport it to zambia and then build

651
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,080
it within their environment

652
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,320
what are the things that might happen

653
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,880
that would impact its ability to work

654
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,039
to perform the way it was designed we

655
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,559
had to think through that

656
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,520
we also had to think about the the

657
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,200
people who were running the security

658
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,559
operations center

659
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,640
and what were the disparate

660
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,559
responsibilities they had in addition to

661
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,039
this

662
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,880
that would require them to divide their

663
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,880
time between the security operation

664
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,440
center

665
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
the building of it the ongoing

666
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,960
management of the

667
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,720
solution and then finally we had to

668
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,000
figure out okay

669
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,480
in this situation that something bad

670
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,200
happened

671
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,880
given that we were an american-based

672
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,280
firm how would we be able to deliver

673
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,960
solutions to them

674
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,480
in the future and all of that

675
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,840
is not just plopping the technology down

676
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,039
it required that we take a multi-step

677
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,000
approach

678
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,120
in which we had to figure out if the end

679
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,159
result

680
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,799
was that we had a up and running

681
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,880
security operations center

682
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,039
in zambia thousands of miles away

683
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,320
what would be the impact who would be

684
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,640
need to be involved and why would we

685
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,679
have why would we

686
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,480
be um responsible for ensuring the

687
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,919
long-term continuity of it

688
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,840
so part step one of that

689
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,400
was we had to put ourselves in the

690
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,960
position

691
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,320
of the free cell at that time

692
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,279
the ciso was a really very highly

693
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,720
strategic person

694
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,600
who was very clear on what the purpose

695
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,240
was

696
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,039
he had a rock-solid team of people who

697
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:17,440
um

698
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,320
he had to support him but what he didn't

699
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,880
have

700
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,919
was a dispersed team of individuals who

701
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,000
could help him run that program

702
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,520
run the the stock so we built a stock

703
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,640
in um in the capital but it had

704
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,799
that he had endpoints and he had other

705
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,039
uh banks across zambia

706
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,200
and so what we had to do was figure out

707
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,760
what was going to be

708
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,080
his role the roles of the of the people

709
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,919
that we had to put a racy together and

710
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,520
then we also had to figure out

711
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,520
how we could enable technology in the

712
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,039
situations where there are no humans

713
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,080
involved

714
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,760
so human-centered design also accepts

715
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,480
that there will also be a lack of human

716
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,279
labor

717
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,080
and it allows for automation but what we

718
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,679
had to do was say

719
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,960
what is the problem who's involved

720
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
and how can we make their their um

721
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,159
experience with the solution

722
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,279
easier it started with empathy

723
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,200
secondly we had to find the why

724
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,000
why did this stock matter right so i

725
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,120
showed you the picture of the people

726
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,960
before

727
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,919
the mattered because if there had

728
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,200
been a breach

729
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,880
of zamako that bank would be taken down

730
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
and they would be out of business they'd

731
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,039
lose substantial revenue

732
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,120
and so it's not just that we as security

733
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,240
people are doing this

734
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,600
in um a vacuum the work we do is so

735
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,720
important because

736
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,919
we hold up businesses i think more and

737
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:48,559
more

738
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,039
organizations understand that a good

739
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,240
cyber security

740
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,360
program is a protection

741
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,919
and it reduces liability but we've got

742
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,679
to keep driving

743
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,720
why it matters the purpose of it

744
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,799
and then even as we're building security

745
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,000
control

746
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,039
if our job is to enable the business to

747
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,000
secure it

748
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,520
we have to make sure that it keeps

749
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,360
running and therefore our security

750
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,159
controls

751
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,679
can't stop business so as what so

752
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,640
and i'll take you back to zanaco when we

753
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,600
were on site

754
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,120
and we were working with the teams to

755
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,440
build out the solution

756
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,360
we had to operate in the middle of the

757
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,120
night and i believe

758
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,880
we did most of our work on a wednesday

759
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,000
here's why on wednesdays the

760
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,559
organization was already used to a

761
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,520
shift change they were used to lots of

762
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:41,919
uh

763
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,039
midweek interruptions and therefore

764
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,679
our interruption if joined with the rest

765
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:48,799
of the interruptions

766
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,000
would be a great way to get in

767
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,919
get get into the business process

768
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,600
without disrupting it

769
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,840
so because we understood why we were

770
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,919
there we understood that

771
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,720
although securing the organization was

772
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,440
important

773
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,960
it wasn't more important than the

774
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,880
operations of the business and so that

775
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,720
was important

776
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,880
we then brainstormed so we got on site

777
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,159
and we actually put together

778
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,200
a um a um a

779
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,320
a white board and it had the

780
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,799
all the tasks everything we wanted to do

781
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,600
we had the

782
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,480
cso we have the ceo of the bank come in

783
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,760
we had uh the

784
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,399
auditor come in we had finance come in

785
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,039
and

786
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,399
our team came in along with our um our

787
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,600
stock leader in the u.s and we all

788
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,360
sat together and brainstormed now that

789
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,960
we were in zambia

790
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,440
understood what the limitations were how

791
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,880
we were to proceed with the

792
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,000
with the um with the implementation and

793
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,640
each person contributed and indicated

794
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,399
what their part of it was and why they

795
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,679
thought that they needed to be

796
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,399
considered

797
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,120
and what would be a no a non-negotiable

798
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,240
for them

799
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,320
and it was only in bringing all these

800
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,919
things together writing them down

801
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,520
outlining them deciding what the

802
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,840
priorities were that we can understand

803
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,039
the best way to build out an

804
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,440
implementation plan and so

805
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,640
it is about the talking it is about the

806
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,600
the diversity of ideas the collaboration

807
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,919
that's where we got all of the rich

808
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,120
thoughts process

809
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,000
going and in doing that we came up with

810
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,679
the solution

811
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,360
that solution that we finally came up

812
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,279
with was storyboarded

813
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,720
um we we built out a a model so it was

814
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,600
wireframed

815
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,720
um and we outlined what the um the steps

816
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,120
were

817
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,760
from step one to four um and then there

818
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,200
was high level one to four and then of

819
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,720
course we had sub bullets but

820
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,000
essentially we we laid it all out and

821
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,080
it allowed each of us to really take a

822
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,039
look and see

823
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,600
had our thoughts been reflected did we

824
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,279
cover everything

825
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,320
did we did we create a system that we

826
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,120
could all

827
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,520
live with at least in the interim and

828
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
then we also wanted to figure out

829
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,640
if we delivered it as it was would we be

830
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,000
insured

831
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,440
as much success as was possible and

832
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,640
in doing so um what we found is that the

833
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,159
best way to

834
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,200
you know implement the the uh

835
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,640
the the sim uh the sim but they also the

836
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,240
security operation center

837
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,440
was to um work with the data center

838
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,880
you know work in the data center in the

839
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
morning we would then

840
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,039
um have a number of um disparate

841
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,440
teams going out um across the entire

842
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,320
country

843
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,880
to work on getting the um and the

844
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,640
solution implemented in the endpoints

845
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,159
monitored at the different banks where

846
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,360
they do that over a period of two to

847
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,159
three weeks

848
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,159
and then we also came to the conclusion

849
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,279
that um

850
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,200
we wouldn't actually launch the security

851
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,320
operation center

852
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,679
for a few weeks um so we would set it up

853
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,200
but we wouldn't really turn the switch

854
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
on until actually

855
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,880
my team was back in the us and we could

856
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
better manage anything bad that happened

857
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,240
so it was it really was about

858
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,559
how do we ensure that this that the bank

859
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,919
is secured

860
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,679
how do we design a solution that meets

861
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,279
the requirements for all the various

862
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,720
stakeholders

863
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,440
how do we um visualize it so that

864
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,120
everyone can see and ensure that what

865
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,399
they've contributed is actually

866
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,440
reflected

867
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,399
and then finally we had to test it um

868
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,000
and so we did do a small

869
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,960
test i think we did it on the hq um

870
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,279
using a very limited set of things so

871
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,039
they they basically had a

872
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,799
um they had production and then they had

873
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,320
uh the test um

874
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,679
that arranged so we set this up on a

875
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,480
range that existed um with the same

876
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,000
solutions and the same

877
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,919
uh limitations that we expected that

878
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,679
they would have so the latency issues

879
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,600
um we actually use the generator instead

880
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,760
of using um regular power

881
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,880
um we actually loaded it with a lot more

882
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,960
um systems and um um employees than

883
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,279
might be so we had to proportionately

884
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,320
reflect what the

885
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,399
actual uh situation would be and so we

886
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,919
overloaded it to see what that response

887
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,559
was and

888
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,799
um we found that that was not a good

889
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,600
thing to do

890
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,159
um we our first test actually got us

891
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,120
shut down

892
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,320
um our the the generator failed um we

893
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:10,960
ended up

894
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,480
um blowing some other system

895
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,039
and um and so we we stayed up and and

896
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:17,519
stayed

897
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,120
actually a week longer in order to get

898
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
it up and running but we were prepared

899
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,880
for the thing to go badly

900
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,519
and what we needed to make sure is if we

901
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,120
understood what the problems were up

902
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,519
front

903
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,000
that we could ideally pivot and what we

904
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,840
were able to do and i'll tell you it was

905
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,799
not a perfect

906
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,799
engagement in any stretch of the

907
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,840
imagination

908
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,080
but what i'll say is it taught us to

909
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,880
pivot

910
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,919
it taught us you know how to how to

911
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,039
lead a program with a lot of different

912
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,000
challenges that were

913
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,559
against us in the project but also when

914
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,679
the thing went wrong

915
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,440
how to respond quickly to minimize

916
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
impact and i think because we had

917
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,159
planned it

918
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,799
because we understood that we could not

919
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,559
predict what employees would do

920
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,360
because they had very low maturity i

921
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,720
think that their security systems are

922
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,640
much better now but at the time

923
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,240
this was the first security operations

924
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,840
center they had so we ran into

925
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
so many challenges but what we had to do

926
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,240
was predict what could fail

927
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
test it and then we had to pivot and i

928
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,760
think the pivot is where i think we had

929
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,399
the most success

930
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,840
but you know i'm talking about one story

931
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,120
you know and i'm doing that because i

932
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,039
want you guys to understand that i get

933
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,559
that what i'm saying sounds really rosy

934
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,559
like i put a lot of this to the test

935
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,000
i've actually seen a lot of great

936
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,039
success in

937
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,679
applying a lot of this um and so the

938
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,080
four

939
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,840
areas that i feel like we could directly

940
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,440
apply a lot of what i'm saying is in

941
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:39,919
this

942
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,720
the context of privacy um and i have

943
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,960
privacy bolded because i think

944
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,279
it directly human central design and

945
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,880
this idea of privacy

946
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,159
is major because everyone is talking

947
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:52,880
about

948
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,640
the intersection between security and

949
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,080
privacy today

950
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,240
and where security ends the security is

951
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,279
is is really one

952
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,519
facet of its role is to provide

953
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,559
protection for the privacy of data

954
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,760
for users and consumers so one thing we

955
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,679
are responsible for is for privacy of

956
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,559
data

957
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,640
and in my mind the goal for privacy

958
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,120
is to do no harm so there's a

959
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,799
conversation now that's going on

960
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,840
with this idea of um

961
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,519
digital harms right what is the actual

962
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,480
harm caused by technology um and and

963
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,919
really more specifically

964
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,159
what is the harm caused by breach of

965
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,519
technology

966
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,799
and the idea when we think about um

967
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,320
privacy is we want to reduce the amount

968
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,919
of data shared without permission we

969
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,360
want to make sure that people are only

970
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,880
getting access to the data

971
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,200
zero trust that they need to get and

972
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,880
then we also want to make sure that

973
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,440
if a a person indicates that you have

974
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,880
the right to use their data

975
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,720
it's being shared only in permissible

976
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,480
ways only in the ways in which they told

977
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,760
you that that's okay

978
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,440
and in the situation because i'm an

979
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,880
attorney um

980
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,440
that it's not um it's not done in that

981
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:07,919
way

982
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,679
if there are legal protections that

983
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,040
there are other protections

984
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,960
that ensure that the impact to the

985
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
person the individual

986
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,879
is mitigated um and so when we think

987
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,440
about

988
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,399
human centric design in order for us to

989
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,679
better understand

990
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,239
um and protect privacy rights we've got

991
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,440
to understand

992
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,639
why privacy is important why do people

993
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,879
care about the data that is about them

994
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,960
how could it possibly be used in ways

995
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,440
that

996
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,520
we haven't even thought through and what

997
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,199
are the harms caused

998
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,800
once when data is shared without

999
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,280
permission or it's shared in ways that

1000
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,159
are unanticipated

1001
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,839
applying human centered design there

1002
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,440
means that we are

1003
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,079
being very specific and we're being very

1004
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,040
thoughtful

1005
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,599
in the way in which we're using data

1006
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,440
we're thinking about the ways in which

1007
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,040
people interact with data

1008
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,320
what systems they use to um to um

1009
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,280
extract data or to in to engage with it

1010
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,640
and then we're also seeing

1011
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,119
what are the costing what was the the

1012
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,560
the risks and benefits

1013
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,920
of actually sharing data right so if i'm

1014
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,119
on the security team

1015
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,040
i also have privacy under me or work

1016
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,640
closely with the privacy team

1017
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,000
it is my my is my thought about so if

1018
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,240
i'm going to be implementing a new

1019
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,079
system

1020
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,800
who needs to have access to it why do

1021
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,320
they need to have access and what do i

1022
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
need to ask of them

1023
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,440
in order to use the system and if we do

1024
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,240
take that data what is my responsibility

1025
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,839
in terms of protecting it

1026
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,800
so these are greater questions about you

1027
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,599
know

1028
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,640
the it actually elevates security

1029
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,440
because we're actually the protector of

1030
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,480
uh of

1031
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,960
a person's identity right we have more

1032
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
that it's more than just financial now

1033
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,440
it's also about this idea that we are

1034
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,599
the arbiters we are the protectors

1035
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,560
of how people people are seen viewed and

1036
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,079
how they're interacting with the digital

1037
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,280
world

1038
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,480
response resilience i am a an

1039
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,520
advocate for this idea of resilience i

1040
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,240
think

1041
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,079
where i get concerned is that we use it

1042
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,520
in this very

1043
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,040
um broad context when we talk about

1044
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,160
resilience we've got to

1045
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,320
we've got to boil it down to its finer

1046
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,040
points and it's got to be about

1047
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,920
when we say resilience what does it mean

1048
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,400
for an

1049
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,560
organization's security program to

1050
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,720
increase resilience

1051
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,119
and if we focus on human centered design

1052
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:33,920
it means

1053
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,720
we understand intrinsically in the way

1054
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,560
in which we roll things out

1055
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,960
how it is that we want people to respond

1056
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,640
when bad things happen

1057
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,720
we are able to predict when something

1058
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,480
bad may happen

1059
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,200
we have the controls in place at every

1060
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
step of a person's interaction with a

1061
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,160
system

1062
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,640
to ensure that were there a breach

1063
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,560
there's a counter action

1064
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,400
a notification or a a termination of

1065
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,280
service

1066
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,599
that reduces the way in which someone

1067
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,200
might exploit a system

1068
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,000
so resilience is not just in isolation

1069
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,320
something that's intrinsically good

1070
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
resilience without the idea of human

1071
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,440
central design

1072
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,359
is an obstacle if you think about a fort

1073
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,200
um businesses used to be built like

1074
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,119
sports but you can imagine now

1075
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,800
the digital world requires that things

1076
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
be nimble that they be moved around that

1077
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,480
people be on the go that things be

1078
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,520
mobile

1079
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,520
if you're a security team building a

1080
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,839
fort you are not building resilience

1081
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,280
you're building obstacles

1082
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,920
and human nature is to go around it so

1083
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,760
what will happen is you'll get

1084
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,200
um shadow id you'll get um

1085
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,280
you know issues with third-party risk

1086
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,680
you'll get all sorts of additional risks

1087
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,320
because

1088
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,480
we're not taking consideration the ways

1089
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,320
in which people are motivated

1090
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,960
to build resilience to act in ways that

1091
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,560
are in alignment with what security

1092
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,280
would want

1093
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,400
it's got to be a a collaboration between

1094
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,520
security

1095
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,280
hr legal all the other areas finance

1096
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,359
all the other areas of designed around

1097
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,520
protection security

1098
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,320
must be resilient alongside those and in

1099
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,839
the context of the culture of the

1100
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,119
organization

1101
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,320
so the cyber mindset is not about users

1102
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,839
thinking the way security people want

1103
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,000
them to think it's about how we better

1104
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,880
understand

1105
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,200
how to build and design programs how to

1106
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,160
engage and

1107
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,960
interact in ways that align ourselves

1108
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,599
with what the users want

1109
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,920
so identity and access management that

1110
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,560
is also an area in which i find

1111
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,000
um is is becoming more and more

1112
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,480
important

1113
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,839
in fact more people are saying you know

1114
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,000
identity is really the uh

1115
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,359
um the um uh the perimeter so

1116
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,920
it really is about who you are and and

1117
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,960
and who you are

1118
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,880
to this particular system so the

1119
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,880
protection of data becomes important

1120
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,520
so if i'm juliette okafor you know in

1121
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,320
discord

1122
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,640
and i and i um have a different name i

1123
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,680
think it's new

1124
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,800
um and a series of numbers but then

1125
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,280
on twitter i'm jules management right on

1126
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,920
linkedin

1127
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,880
on jules o'connor my identity shifts

1128
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,839
with each system i

1129
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:12,000
interact with and so human-centered

1130
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,760
design means

1131
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,920
do i interact do those systems interact

1132
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
do i make it easy for people to leverage

1133
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,839
different profiles and personalities

1134
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,680
what are the features that i expect

1135
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,839
because i've now gotten into the system

1136
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,040
what things should i have access to

1137
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,880
given the identity that i've put up

1138
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,480
what things should i be sharing or not

1139
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,560
sharing this idea of human sense of

1140
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,160
design takes all of that into

1141
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,799
consideration

1142
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,040
so if we if we figure out where we've

1143
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,440
gotten started

1144
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,040
um i'll i'll be honest let me let me

1145
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,839
let me share that when i first got into

1146
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,920
cyber security i was

1147
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,280
confused i'd say i i entered it and just

1148
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,520
i could not understand

1149
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,920
why and i've met with government

1150
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,839
security operations centers i've been

1151
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,880
in um those of credit unions early on i

1152
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,240
was working with a lot of small and

1153
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,680
mid-sized banks

1154
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,319
and you know my job was to sell security

1155
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,520
systems so i was like

1156
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
okay well they've got a lot of problems

1157
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,839
great they'd love for me to help

1158
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,319
no that was the last thing they wanted

1159
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,000
me to do was to touch the thing that

1160
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,160
they'd set up for months on end and they

1161
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,160
had just gotten to work in some you know

1162
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,520
recognizable way

1163
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,000
um and i felt like i was watching a game

1164
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,960
whack-a-mole

1165
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,839
and what would happen is there'd be an

1166
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,079
instrument that would crop up

1167
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,160
they'd shoot it down then another one

1168
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,440
will crop up

1169
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,599
they shoot it down then they have all

1170
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:40,640
kinds of fires

1171
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,319
people would be running about people

1172
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,160
would be burning out

1173
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,839
there was lots of drinking of course you

1174
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,400
know and i i'll admit to having

1175
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,520
you know join them but they weren't

1176
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,040
solving the problem it was just about

1177
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,119
getting that one thing done so you could

1178
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,040
move on to the other thing

1179
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,240
we're so overloaded with things to do

1180
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,839
we don't have time to look at things

1181
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,079
strategically

1182
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,160
in fact what's happening is even when

1183
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,680
we're bringing on

1184
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,880
talent new talent with fresh ideas we're

1185
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,680
asking them to submit and fall into

1186
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,720
the very bad processes that already

1187
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,680
exist

1188
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,200
and we're teaching them the bad habits

1189
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,040
we have as an

1190
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,920
industry what we're trying to do is

1191
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,240
we're trying to figure out how to

1192
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,280
um to to fight the bad guys and to stop

1193
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,319
the breach and to

1194
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,079
to be you know to get ahead of the

1195
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,160
problem to to move to the left

1196
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,200
um but the issue is that we don't have

1197
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,400
enough time

1198
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,560
we don't have enough resources and

1199
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,319
typically we don't have a lot of

1200
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,920
internal support

1201
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,800
and so i'm not blaming us for doing

1202
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,079
guacamole

1203
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,880
i just want us to start to figure out

1204
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
what is it that we need to do

1205
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,160
to really start to change and revolve

1206
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,319
so that the cyber of the future is not

1207
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,319
those of the past because what we're

1208
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,359
doing now

1209
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,000
isn't working and i'm hoping we can all

1210
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,800
agree

1211
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,599
that it's just it's not working one of

1212
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,119
the things that i've seen

1213
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,520
that i thought was really really smart

1214
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,640
but unfortunately

1215
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,760
only happens after a company is breached

1216
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,240
they have one team that is responsible

1217
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,000
for maintaining

1218
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,760
and they have another team responsible

1219
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
for strategy and building

1220
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,079
and what happens is when one team is

1221
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,599
focused on reacting they can keep

1222
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,680
everything going the systems are running

1223
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,400
you know they can respond um to uh

1224
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,000
employees and users who are telling them

1225
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,560
the bad things

1226
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,640
are happening they can you know uh have

1227
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,839
analysts who are

1228
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,760
um reviewing you know the the

1229
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,040
notifications in the alerts as they're

1230
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,079
coming in

1231
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:45,920
but you also need a team that's sitting

1232
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,319
to the side and not a big team maybe two

1233
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:49,440
or three people

1234
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,760
who are really taking a systems design

1235
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,520
look and saying

1236
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,079
we've got now technology everywhere

1237
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:56,720
we've got

1238
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,240
you know all the good stuff we've got

1239
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,760
we've got technology that's been here

1240
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,800
for days

1241
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,880
but we also have technology that we've

1242
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,319
had for years that

1243
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,560
is no longer um is end of life we need

1244
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,920
to pull out

1245
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,319
we also have users who are complaining

1246
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,920
that they can't get access to certain

1247
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,119
systems and we spend

1248
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,680
a lot of our time with i.t um you know

1249
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,319
telling

1250
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,520
them who should have assets who

1251
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,359
shouldn't and having these fighting

1252
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:20,240
these fires

1253
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,599
fighting these wars what is the thing

1254
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,880
that we can do

1255
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,000
but if we assume humans are the center

1256
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,359
of both the problem

1257
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,480
and the solution we can use technology

1258
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,240
to enable

1259
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,960
their work product their communications

1260
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,720
and make it easier for them to do their

1261
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,680
job

1262
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,000
it should be about how security and

1263
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,920
technology enables the human to do their

1264
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,800
job

1265
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,040
it's got to be about the behaviors we

1266
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,640
understand in humans

1267
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,119
that we anticipate will happen we do

1268
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,560
this on the other side

1269
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,200
when we think about the kill chain and

1270
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,560
attack kill chain

1271
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,040
we have the ability to automate

1272
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,400
responses based on what we

1273
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,160
how we think a hacker will attack in

1274
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,760
fact the whole idea of threat

1275
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,359
intelligence is the same way

1276
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,359
what we haven't done is then applied

1277
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,440
that inside the organization

1278
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
so we can anticipate the way users will

1279
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,920
behave and then we've applied technology

1280
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,200
to respond

1281
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,440
it seems on one end when we think about

1282
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,280
hackers we've done our job there

1283
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,880
but when we think about our users we

1284
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,800
think of them as either

1285
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,000
just neglectful reckless or stupid

1286
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,599
and we haven't done our homework there

1287
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,920
to really start to dig into

1288
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,280
how could we have both user experience

1289
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,440
service delivery right meat service

1290
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,480
delivery time

1291
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
but also make sure that the security

1292
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,599
works

1293
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,920
i think that we're deploying security

1294
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,599
but we're not making sure it works and

1295
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,560
it can't work

1296
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,640
if we don't understand how it's supposed

1297
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,640
to interact with the human beings

1298
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,839
that are the focus

1299
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,160
i think that every one of us in cyber

1300
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,240
security are designers

1301
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,839
i think our craft our trade

1302
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,319
requires it and i'll tell you a little

1303
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:04,880
secret

1304
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,160
i also think that many of us are

1305
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,760
a much more artist than we are

1306
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,599
scientists

1307
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,240
cyber security compared to the rest of

1308
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,119
the industries

1309
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,240
medicine um manufacturing

1310
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,440
it is still so new that we

1311
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,480
all act as artists and designers there

1312
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,920
is that scientific

1313
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,319
uh um foundation i will not say that

1314
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,599
that does not exist

1315
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,000
what i will tell you is that we all have

1316
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,079
the ability to design the way in which

1317
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,040
we

1318
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,319
deliver and perform in our roles and the

1319
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,119
way in which

1320
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,760
the future will demand that we design

1321
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,119
cyber security

1322
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,640
is by encouraging and enabling humans

1323
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,880
as a part of any product or solution

1324
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,000
that we put out

1325
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,640
as a part of any report that we create

1326
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,880
is the report that i'm creating

1327
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,880
makes sense to me but could a common

1328
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,079
person read it

1329
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,319
could your mother or grandmother read it

1330
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,520
would they care

1331
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,359
and if they wouldn't care in your first

1332
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,760
draft how do you make them care

1333
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,280
as a designer you have the ability to

1334
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,480
empower yourself and others by the way

1335
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
in which you do your job so it is

1336
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,000
important that we take humans into

1337
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,760
consideration throughout the entire life

1338
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,319
cycle

1339
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,720
of any project or initiative any change

1340
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,800
management strategy management strategy

1341
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,839
or any even any instant response program

1342
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,079
we have to begin to design the way in

1343
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,359
which we want

1344
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,680
users to engage with us and with the

1345
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,720
systems that we're providing

1346
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,760
so i want us today to begin to imagine a

1347
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,960
world

1348
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,079
where we are reducing friction

1349
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,560
and some of this sounds soft and it

1350
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,200
sounds

1351
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,839
you know uh it sounds like it's

1352
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,359
something that's kind of made up and

1353
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,240
fuzzy

1354
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,560
but i i imagine each of you was doing it

1355
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,160
in your job today

1356
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,760
it is about um going against the brain

1357
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,119
it is about asking yourself ways that

1358
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,960
you could potentially be better

1359
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,040
it is about asking whether or not and

1360
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,319
this is something you can ask in

1361
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,560
meetings with your bosses

1362
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,000
is what we're doing working

1363
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,720
um how is is what what i'm doing

1364
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,400
supposed to work

1365
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,119
what does performance look like if we

1366
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:21,920
succeed

1367
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,000
what should it feel like those are

1368
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,960
human-centered design-centered questions

1369
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,839
in addition we've got to figure out how

1370
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:30,880
what we do

1371
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,079
fits into a broader subsection of

1372
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,880
a system a system is the business

1373
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,000
outside of it but more

1374
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,720
importantly the different domains inside

1375
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,079
inside of cyber security

1376
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,760
how do they all fit together how does

1377
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,680
the penetration team fit with the

1378
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,599
threatened coach team that fits with the

1379
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,599
awareness team that fits with the

1380
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,040
vulnerability management team

1381
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,119
how do they all work together and what

1382
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,119
should that feel like i think right now

1383
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,880
a lot of it can be very clunky

1384
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,480
human centered design will focus on

1385
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,280
if the humans at the center of this what

1386
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,559
should their experience be

1387
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,400
in each of these domains and that will

1388
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,079
be what brings it together i think a lot

1389
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,880
of security tends to be very disparate

1390
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,079
we also want to ask more questions so

1391
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,880
what is it that we what's happening why

1392
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,720
is it happening what's the purpose

1393
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,800
of asking purpose-based questions we

1394
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,480
want to conduct our research so

1395
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,040
what is it that we see um where is it

1396
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,480
that i can get more information

1397
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,040
who else has done this i think twitter

1398
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,079
is a great

1399
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:33,200
place um for that i think um you know i

1400
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,960
find a lot of interesting stories on

1401
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,240
reddit um

1402
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,400
but there's a lot of forums that you can

1403
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,680
find where you're really doing your

1404
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,720
research on

1405
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,119
what what people have done but also if

1406
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,240
you're looking to move

1407
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,119
into systems design thinking let's start

1408
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,800
to talk to some systems engineers

1409
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,240
also you might be able to work with some

1410
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,839
people in 19 who've done this kind of

1411
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:52,480
work

1412
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,960
um that's that's really the goal here

1413
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,760
and then

1414
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,480
pretend to be someone else uh we have

1415
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,599
some very

1416
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,400
very uh great personalities inside of

1417
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,599
cyber security

1418
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,280
but in order for us to make a change

1419
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,880
we've got to sit in the position of

1420
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,280
of someone other than us someone other

1421
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,640
than someone like us

1422
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,240
so i'm adhd highly sensitive empath

1423
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,559
i but i have extroverted tendencies i've

1424
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,160
got to sit with someone who is

1425
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,200
introverted

1426
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,000
maybe not as highly intellectual not

1427
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,359
highly analytical

1428
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,880
who really just doesn't care about

1429
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,760
security it is that person who will give

1430
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,359
me the best perspective on

1431
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,200
how to change my communication i have to

1432
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,559
go outside of myself

1433
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,480
and actually to the opposite side in

1434
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,680
order to better understand what the

1435
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,558
possibilities are

1436
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,480
so i mentioned that so you've got to ask

1437
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,079
who will use the technology what will

1438
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,280
they use it for

1439
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,359
how will they use it and does it solve

1440
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:46,720
the problem that they're looking to

1441
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,599
solve

1442
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,079
cyber security is a problem solving

1443
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,640
industry it is about the end result

1444
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,040
and the way that we get there is by

1445
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,240
asking questions

1446
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,240
that are designed around the human

1447
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,440
part of the process that i encourage is

1448
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,119
find inspiration so when i say

1449
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,319
inspiration i mean

1450
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,240
what you want to start to do is let's

1451
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,559
look at um

1452
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,359
what what what is possible so i like to

1453
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:14,880
when we're doing brainstorming

1454
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,480
put out all the different things that

1455
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,920
are possible you want to be

1456
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,920
bringing in different uh industry work

1457
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,359
so a lot of the work i do

1458
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,040
is really um inspired by marketing um i

1459
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,359
like a lot of the i'm working on

1460
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,800
diversity job descriptions i

1461
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,040
look at marketing job description um

1462
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,880
with a lot of the work we do i actually

1463
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,359
look at

1464
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,839
coding um for the for the kind of

1465
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,599
thinking that i need to actually

1466
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,079
um empathize with so there are ways to

1467
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,520
be inspired you've got to find that

1468
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,880
inspiration you've got to be outside

1469
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,839
yourself

1470
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,240
ideation brainstorming collaboration so

1471
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,520
talking it through

1472
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,040
lots and lots of communication back and

1473
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,440
forth all of those planning sessions

1474
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,359
those work groups those are so critical

1475
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,880
to human central design

1476
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,720
and then implementation you got to put

1477
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,000
it into practice

1478
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,119
put it into operations test and pivot

1479
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,400
but that's what i want you guys to do

1480
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,440
not to think but to do it's in the doing

1481
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,000
that we see

1482
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,800
the change happen

1483
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,079
ultimately what we want to make sure is

1484
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,520
that we are

1485
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,760
with human centered design doing three

1486
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,200
major things

1487
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,079
we can see an increase in performance we

1488
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:22,640
need to be

1489
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,480
measuring whether the security controls

1490
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,680
are putting in place

1491
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,680
whether the problems that we're building

1492
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,680
and whether the awareness

1493
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,319
areas that we tend to uh communicate are

1494
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,440
actually performing

1495
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,079
is it working do people care and and are

1496
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,160
we seeing a reduction in risk based on

1497
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,240
what we're what we're having happen

1498
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,160
we need to improve the user experience

1499
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,520
so are people

1500
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,960
coming back to us and saying this is

1501
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,200
great or are they saying please no more

1502
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,520
or you know are we telling them no

1503
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,040
before they come to us

1504
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,200
what is the actual engagement that we're

1505
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,040
doing with users so that they feel like

1506
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,760
they are

1507
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,680
part of the process by which we're

1508
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,680
working we in security can't work in

1509
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,280
isolation

1510
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,280
and then one of the things i learned my

1511
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,480
first day of law school

1512
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,440
by a professor who i remember today but

1513
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:07,920
he was

1514
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,280
very very mean to me um when i rambled

1515
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,520
on and on in my law school class

1516
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,880
what he said was keep it simple stupid

1517
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,800
and i thought it was a little bit of an

1518
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,880
insult but what he was saying is

1519
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,200
if you cannot explain to the average

1520
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,079
person

1521
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,319
in a short amount of time what you're

1522
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,000
doing and why it matters

1523
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,400
you do not understand it as security

1524
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,440
professionals

1525
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,559
if we're thinking about other people all

1526
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,000
of the language that we think works for

1527
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,960
us is great

1528
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,119
but it may not work for other people and

1529
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,400
our job

1530
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,800
is to solve problems to increase

1531
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,839
performance

1532
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,160
and really to enable others to do the

1533
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,319
best job that they can when we do that

1534
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,319
we are actually delivering on what our

1535
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,880
promise is

1536
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,359
so our future our collective future

1537
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:58,720
looks like this

1538
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,040
i want you all to go out and start to

1539
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,760
imagine the

1540
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,240
ideal security scenario what does that

1541
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,599
look like

1542
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,000
over and over again i hear how little

1543
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,160
people get with regard to

1544
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,079
you know they're doing the job but they

1545
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:14,079
they don't see the progress or

1546
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,319
they're they are they are in a situation

1547
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,480
where they don't feel appreciated

1548
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,160
imagine your ideal scenario imagine that

1549
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,319
you were the person who was impacted by

1550
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,000
your security

1551
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,319
how would you want that to look like or

1552
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,480
feel

1553
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,520
start to practice saying yes but i

1554
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,800
envision a future

1555
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,079
that is security that is future um

1556
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,400
that is um forward-thinking but it's

1557
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,079
also service leading

1558
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,200
it is about delivering a service that is

1559
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,880
really complex but it's also high impact

1560
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,720
and so you want to start to say yes but

1561
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,480
instead of no we're going to be the

1562
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,240
organization that says yes

1563
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,359
but we also then finally want to

1564
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:00,960
understand the users understanding

1565
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,160
security where do you

1566
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,800
we have to meet the users where they are

1567
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,119
so it's not it's not enough for us to

1568
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,040
take our shirts and not for us to go to

1569
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,400
all the cons and

1570
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,319
for us to um you know do the

1571
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,400
gamification

1572
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,800
what is it about what we're learning

1573
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,119
that we can apply and translate

1574
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,960
so that a user with little knowledge

1575
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,640
about cyber security can benefit from

1576
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,040
that

1577
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,200
we've got to start talking less about

1578
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,520
knowledge and more about benefit

1579
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,599
that is what i see as the future of

1580
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,240
cyber security

1581
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,920
and i again want to thank you

1582
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,799
um this is the end of my presentation

1583
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:39,280
