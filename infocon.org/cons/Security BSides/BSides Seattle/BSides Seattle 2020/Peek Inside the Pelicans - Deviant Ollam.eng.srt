1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:07,580
[Music]

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,080
we're all doing our best during the

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,519
pandemic aren't we

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,000
um yeah my wife is way better at

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,679
presenting from home than i am but

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,720
hopefully

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,119
uh hopefully you all will enjoy this at

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,119
least a little bit

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,240
this talk is going to be kind of

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,880
different for me most of the time

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,359
i am showing you a ton of slides right

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,320
most of the time

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,359
i have a bunch of artwork and videos and

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,160
it's just very polished this is a talk

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,920
with zero slides

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,000
this is a talk exclusively about showing

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
you hardware so i figured

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
unlike most most times at cons when i

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,920
can't travel with as much as i travel

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,760
with on jobs i am literally home

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
like all of you i am literally home and

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,800
i have

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,280
a bunch of cases with me so let's go

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,480
ahead and do this

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,640
right this is the peek inside the

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,680
pelicans

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,399
and when if those who don't know uh i am

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,840
for yeah i don't know if we did intros

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,520
right i am deviant

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,680
i have been around many of many of these

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,360
events oh we even have a live audience

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,280
clap awesome

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
yes i do a lot of physical side security

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,040
work

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
i do physical penetration i run a covert

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,280
entry team i am a safe technician and

37
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,400
safe cracker

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,320
i would love to answer any questions you

39
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,080
may have about physical security around

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,040
your facilities

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,720
but this talk is about showing you how

42
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,799
we exploit that physical security

43
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,520
so when we are on jobs when my team

44
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,360
deploys somewhere we get set up we

45
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,119
usually rent an airbnb

46
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,119
everyone just starts bringing in cases

47
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,520
of equipment either hard dig cases

48
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,680
or you know storm cases in my case i'm a

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,000
big fan of pelican gear

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,280
so right now in my house i have

51
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,680
an array of stuff some of it will be at

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,280
other offices some of we other team

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
members my stuff comes in

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,600
three main cases we have a case called

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,720
penetration

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,960
a case called field gear and a case

57
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
called social engineering

58
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,600
so i'm not sure how long this will take

59
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,840
we're going to free form it a little bit

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,560
and go through just a list of everything

61
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:04,960
and

62
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,840
please for anyone who wants to ask

63
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,520
questions the entire time

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,680
we have a we have a lovely volunteer

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,680
person who will

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
take a look at your talking as you're

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,160
typing and we'll go from there

68
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,280
so starting off we open this case up and

69
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480
some of you can see there there are

70
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,840
things that look like large

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,440
wires what are they well any one of you

72
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,640
who have done a lot of

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,080
hardware work in the field you can

74
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,200
recognize right under door tools

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
for anyone who does not follow not so

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,239
civil engineer

77
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,840
on youtube you're doing it wrong you

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
should follow him so not so civil

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
engineer had some really cool mods to

80
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,640
the under door tool

81
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,840
not least of which is the use of a

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,959
retractable

83
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,440
cord right this is a device called a

84
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,319
keyback

85
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,560
it is used for well janitors and the

86
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
like who need to always be reaching for

87
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,040
their keys

88
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,200
this is their big heavy duty one it

89
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,040
comes with a very very long

90
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,239
kevlar style cord and anything you can

91
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,000
do to kind of police up

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
and manage that under door tools cord

93
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,760
especially in the field

94
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,840
is a really good thing you can kind of

95
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,800
also see

96
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,599
that on other tools we have made we just

97
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,280
have that cord kind of you know wound up

98
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,800
and bunched up now that's great when

99
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
it's in storage but when you actually

100
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,680
deploy it you're in the field you're

101
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,200
wrapping up on yourself you're getting

102
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,640
all caught and tied

103
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,200
this holy crap is this the way to

104
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,400
freaking go with under door tools

105
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
more tools we've got a klein tools bag

106
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,000
here

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,760
we've got a zipper bag let's just start

108
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,480
pulling out bags i am a big proponent

109
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,560
of containerization inside of things

110
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,159
right all right

111
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,920
let's see let's let's take this small

112
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,680
one that's the heaviest one of all

113
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,840
why the hell does it weigh so much well

114
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
it's because a lot of brass is in here

115
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
this is key impressioning so you've got

116
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,959
a ton of blanks

117
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,680
we've got some impressioning handles

118
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,120
this is what you've got

119
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,040
if you need to try to either try to find

120
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,120
a master key try to work a lock if

121
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,000
you're not familiar with an

122
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,959
impressioning is

123
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,680
ask over in the lock picking chat i see

124
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,200
a number of familiar names who are

125
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,879
running that for this con

126
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,959
but impressioning is an attack that does

127
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,920
involve blank keys

128
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,439
and you've got to have the right blank

129
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,200
key for every lock so we travel with a

130
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,000
ton of them

131
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
many of them are going to be schlage

132
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,759
because frankly you run into a ton of

133
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,680
schlage equipment in commercial spaces

134
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
right

135
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,880
this feels really light

136
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
feels incredibly light but i can tell

137
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,639
you it contains more keys

138
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,840
what does it contain this is called a

139
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,080
heavy equipment key set

140
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,000
many times when you have large

141
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,199
construction equipment

142
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,160
cranes you name it this kind of gear it

143
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,000
doesn't they all have unique keys if

144
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,440
you've seen howard payne and i

145
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,639
give a presentation about key to like

146
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,680
equipment this is the case for tons and

147
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,320
tons

148
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,800
of heavy and we have we just have lists

149
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
of which you know this is a guide

150
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,120
if you have a crane if you have a in a

151
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
scissor lift

152
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,479
we've absolutely borrowed a scissor lift

153
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,680
one time to get kind of

154
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,759
up into a ceiling area we didn't have to

155
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,680
hunt for the key we had the key

156
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,440
if you're looking online for this though

157
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,199
you want to search for tornado by the

158
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,520
way

159
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
tornado is who makes this quote heavy

160
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,560
equipment key set

161
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,960
klein tools bag why is it the lineman's

162
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
bag well this is a lot of just hand

163
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,639
tools and the like right a lot of manual

164
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
tools little power driver i did a video

165
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,639
review

166
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,560
about liking to like have you know

167
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,479
enjoying having an actual power driver

168
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,919
when i'm popping card readers off the

169
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,440
wall and such

170
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
if you watch lock picking lawyer holy

171
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,120
crap dude the nut buster the nut

172
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,639
splitter

173
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,880
you can shear apart i'm not saying we

174
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
always like to go with this kinetic

175
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,880
right

176
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
but if you have a you know heavy pair of

177
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,199
pliers or a saskatchewan nut rounder

178
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,560
that you can crescent wrench on the end

179
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,520
of this

180
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,840
absolutely we have chunked chains apart

181
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,600
we have broken shackles apart when the

182
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,360
client has wanted us to go

183
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,280
destructive or pliers again this is this

184
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,039
is just kind of brutal hand tools kind

185
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:03,520
of

186
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,240
sloppy police type entry tools in hotel

187
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,039
rooms

188
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,479
if you're not familiar with what a lock

189
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,520
jockey is many many police and first

190
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,960
responders trying to get into hotel

191
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,800
rooms are going to use a couple of tools

192
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,639
like a slim jim and a lock jockey

193
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,840
to pop those night latches apart

194
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,400
wire and cord you can never have enough

195
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,880
wire

196
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,360
and cord uh in fact so much so that

197
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,160
there's even

198
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,960
you know a giant spool of paracord here

199
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,919
in the pelican case right

200
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,120
bits and other assorted cutty things

201
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,400
so manual hand tools this is fun this is

202
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,560
like i get to do an inventory

203
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,120
of my own stuff and see how much i've

204
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,880
been keeping around that i do or don't

205
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,120
use anymore

206
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
perhaps the funniest hand tool of all

207
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,400
you'll see these appear elsewhere as

208
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,360
well

209
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,880
long like old person retiree grabbers

210
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
right like just because a security

211
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,479
camera or some

212
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,240
sensor is a little bit out of reach you

213
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,919
don't have to do the whole ladder

214
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,720
routine like

215
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
oh i'm gonna walk in with a letter we

216
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,319
have definitely gotten in places looking

217
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,000
like we belong there with a ladder

218
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,400
but have like this was a walmart special

219
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,960
this was a four dollar walmart special

220
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,280
and i used it to actually just change

221
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,720
the direction of a camera

222
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
that was facing down on a badge reader

223
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,720
that we wanted to mess with

224
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
nobody came out after i changed the

225
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,000
direction on the camera we left it for

226
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,039
two or three days

227
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,479
someone else went up there worked all

228
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,240
they wanted to work

229
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
more bags

230
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,880
a little bit more on the precision side

231
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,800
of tools

232
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
this is the bag of stuff that i don't

233
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,800
drop and kick around very hard

234
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
we do have a digital caliper for some

235
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,080
key measurements

236
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,919
we have some spare parts for what is

237
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,759
known as a pack-a-punch

238
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,440
we have some spare parts for the

239
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,400
electronics side of the house

240
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,440
if we're working with our esp keys this

241
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,280
is oh this is really nice this was a

242
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,720
gift from someone

243
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,080
at lockcon i'm gonna say this must have

244
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,560
been

245
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,240
seven years ago that somebody made this

246
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
this is a little you know a little

247
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,599
flashlight right

248
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,039
somebody it might have been either

249
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
bobbik who did this

250
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,680
maybe maybe holly remembers uh she might

251
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,879
have been there

252
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,840
so this is a filament just you know

253
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,879
fiber optic style

254
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,840
filament right this is a 3d printed tip

255
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,560
that clicks

256
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,960
over the end of this tiny pocket

257
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
flashlight

258
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,960
and now we actually have ourselves an

259
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,919
itsy bitsy

260
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,958
fiber optic light useful for looking

261
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,200
deep down inside of keyways

262
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
trying to count pins trying to see if

263
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,880
you've screwed something up

264
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,799
and knocked a master pin out of

265
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
alignment because you were picking or

266
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
manipulating a master keyed system and

267
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,839
shouldn't have been doing that not like

268
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,360
i would ever be speaking from experience

269
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
there and accidentally knocked a master

270
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
pin out of where it shouldn't have been

271
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,399
so yeah more sensitive tools and

272
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,399
equipment spare parts and

273
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,560
electronics to beat the band another

274
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,880
punch down tool for our esp keys more

275
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,519
esp keys are down here

276
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,760
so yeah this is kind of the more small

277
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,959
sensitive equipment

278
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,040
and we're still in pelican case number

279
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,399
one of three

280
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,760
i hope this is uh valuable thus far

281
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,839
what else is coming on aha

282
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,160
the white bag that should have a giant

283
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,080
warning label on it

284
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,040
this is the dangerous magnet bag in fact

285
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,959
you can even see things inside of it are

286
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,240
are packed inside of other boxes

287
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,080
designed to give space in between

288
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,399
different boxes so just space upon space

289
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,240
upon space

290
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
this is a magnet with well i don't want

291
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,399
to imagine the pull strength of this

292
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,279
magnet

293
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,120
but i do know that because of the

294
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,560
inverse square law

295
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,240
if we keep it inside of enough

296
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
containers it won't absolutely

297
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
kill people when they're near it this

298
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,640
magnet is even more heavy duty

299
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,000
and let's see this one's still in its

300
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,519
professional packaging let me keep it

301
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,880
away from all the other magnets

302
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,240
yeah if you are transporting magnets

303
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,360
definitely honeycomb that stuff up with

304
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,200
the packaging that it came with so that

305
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
you're not going through some kind of

306
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
you know not just lifting your your

307
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,240
stuff out of your bag and all of a

308
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,519
sudden your hammers and your

309
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,880
vice grips and everything else are just

310
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
attached to this block that you're never

311
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
never going to free it from ever again

312
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,000
in the future

313
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,079
why would i have heavy duty magnets in

314
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,440
this case well

315
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,279
if you're familiar with bypassing

316
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,600
sensors bypassing alarm sensors or even

317
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,040
the attack against

318
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,680
the uh simplex lock made by cabba

319
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,000
if you're familiar with the kaaba 1000

320
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,800
series

321
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,200
uh the magneto attack in fact sparrows

322
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
tools sparrows sells a device they call

323
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,720
the magneto

324
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,480
definitely still works occasionally in

325
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,240
the field that lock has been

326
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
revised over the years right it was only

327
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
early versions of the kaaba 1000 that

328
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,120
worked

329
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,040
but if you can get it to work awesome do

330
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,279
it right but if you're transporting your

331
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,240
magnet around

332
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,920
i don't know how sparrows ships the

333
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,200
magneto but put a lot of buffer space

334
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,959
around it

335
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,720
what else we got in here we got a nice

336
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,560
big zipper case right

337
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,839
what could this possibly be

338
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,880
these are the elevator keys

339
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,480
elevator keys of the whole collection

340
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,399
again if you haven't seen the talk

341
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
that howard payne and i gave years ago

342
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,560
about elevator hacking

343
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,519
this is my full key collection uh yes it

344
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,480
has been used

345
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,600
many many times in the field no

346
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
you shouldn't use elevator keys in the

347
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,800
field if you don't know what you're

348
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,680
doing

349
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,720
and we even have a

350
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,440
module in our training classes right

351
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,399
when we talk to people

352
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,959
we show people elevator attacks we show

353
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,120
people how elevator systems work

354
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,880
and our whole we really want to ram it

355
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,240
through people's heads though students

356
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,519
who want to learn this from us we say

357
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,240
look

358
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,800
you don't have to put an elevator on to

359
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,320
other modes of operation

360
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,200
to demonstrate impact for the client if

361
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,320
you have a key

362
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,760
and you're like all right this is this

363
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,079
and crop elevator i've got the l 206 key

364
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,680
i've got the l 203 key

365
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,880
couple of things you can do with a

366
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
client you can walk a client into the

367
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,639
elevator to say

368
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,079
i would like you to document you could

369
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,279
you could take a picture if you're on a

370
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,079
physical job

371
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,079
you take a picture of yourself literally

372
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,760
in the elevator holding the key

373
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,440
that is proof that you had the key in

374
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,360
that elevator if the client

375
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,279
really wants to know like well how do i

376
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,440
know you understand right

377
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,320
you can turn a key without turning a key

378
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,680
you can turn the key slightly and

379
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,440
demonstrate to the client look

380
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,360
this this key is turning this is the

381
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,120
right key

382
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,480
i'm not going to turn it all away and

383
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,760
the client if they really they really

384
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,040
put you like you like

385
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,639
i mean you can turn the key it's your

386
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,160
freaking building boss

387
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,240
but you don't have to actually mess with

388
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,839
elevators in order to demonstrate them

389
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,440
as a vulnerability so when we say we

390
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,800
have all these keys

391
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
being able to just verify with the

392
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,639
client we could do this

393
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,959
this is feasible this is the working key

394
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,079
that's what happens

395
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,000
in many instances and it covers your

396
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,440
butt

397
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,120
speaking also cover your butt and talk

398
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,800
to your lawyers

399
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,279
spy cables for those who aren't familiar

400
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,079
these are audio and gps tracker cables

401
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,680
these are eavesdropping cables there are

402
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,160
many

403
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,480
many like them they are i have i have a

404
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
few more that are actually in another

405
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,040
job case because they all used to be in

406
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,519
here

407
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,320
but yeah this is not just a regular

408
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,639
phone charging cable if you take this

409
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,200
sleeve off you know this will accept a

410
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,399
sim card

411
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,680
this is a bug this is a bug cable uh now

412
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,959
when we do our proper

413
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,839
professional surveillance class we have

414
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,480
much much

415
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,200
better gear and equipment not just sort

416
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
of you know this is literally an amazon

417
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,600
special

418
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,920
but again i had to demonstrate once to a

419
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,639
client

420
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,399
uh the law office said well what could

421
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,160
happen if one got in here i didn't even

422
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,279
plug this in

423
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,440
i just swapped it with a cable that was

424
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,040
sitting in a law office that was our

425
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,600
client

426
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
and i said okay so see that cable in a

427
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,120
drawer they said yeah i said take it out

428
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,320
that's not the cable that was there and

429
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,519
they opened it and they freaked out

430
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,040
didn't even have a sim card in it

431
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,279
so it's not like it was a real bug but

432
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,360
being able to show them oh someone could

433
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,639
do that to you

434
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,360
that was an incredible value add why did

435
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,120
i mention lawyers first though

436
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,639
because eavesdropping understand your

437
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,199
laws

438
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,600
understand one-party consent understand

439
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,360
all party consent what state and

440
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,120
territory you're operating in

441
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,639
don't screw around with eavesdropping if

442
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,040
you don't know what you're doing

443
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
we got another bag what's in this case

444
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,720
this is possibly this is going to be a

445
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,760
cautionary tale

446
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,440
and you'll see this comes this is a this

447
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,600
is a callback joke later

448
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,480
this is an itsy bitsy battery-powered

449
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,320
dremel

450
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,839
the the dremel hand tool line of

451
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,519
products you know

452
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,279
many times you've got a fabric cobble a

453
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,560
new tool

454
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,639
this is battery even yeah the reason

455
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,920
this doesn't matter to me and i could

456
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,360
probably just throw it out

457
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,440
i bought this on a job when i was trying

458
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,600
to manufacture an under door tool in a

459
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,040
hotel room

460
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,480
and i said well if i'm going to buy a

461
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,440
dremel i might as well get the dremel

462
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,000
that i can you know have on the job i

463
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,440
can have a job you know i can be

464
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,720
what if i get the dremel and i want it

465
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,560
in the field maybe i have to fix this

466
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,079
tool i should get the battery powered

467
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,399
one

468
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,560
keep it in my field bag my field bag

469
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,519
that we'll go through in a minute

470
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,480
this is without a doubt the worst

471
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,519
product ever

472
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,600
if you're ever getting like that little

473
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,720
screwdriver great

474
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
screwdrivers low power short usage

475
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,240
dremel

476
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,480
and rotary cutting tools much more of a

477
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,920
long duty cycle you're going to put a

478
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,839
lot more energy into that tool

479
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,959
the battery tools conk out all the time

480
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,720
and they're off like this can right

481
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
off

482
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,759
that is not a tool i want the field

483
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,360
frankly anymore i'm glad this is i'm

484
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
glad we're doing this

485
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,720
a couple more things to get through

486
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,440
speaking of the spy cables right

487
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,480
also in spy territory

488
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,839
we've talked about it in class this is a

489
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:50,800
usb

490
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,360
bore scope this is something that we can

491
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,240
you know slip

492
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,759
through a door so we've actually slipped

493
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,440
this inside of a safe before

494
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,120
uh because safe have mounting holes

495
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,240
right usb is nice because not only

496
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,759
modern phones right you don't have to

497
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,519
just plug into a laptop

498
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,279
if you have an android device that

499
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,360
supports what's called otg or on-the-go

500
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,920
mode

501
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,320
making your port a master port you can

502
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,120
actually control

503
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,240
usb device i can look on my phone and i

504
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,320
can see what this camera is seeing

505
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000
so i'll be able to we usually use these

506
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
to slip under doors

507
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,959
if we're looking to do an underdoor

508
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,160
attack we're trying to see where the

509
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,959
door handle

510
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,360
is having a little bore scope with you

511
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,320
sometimes comes into play and is useful

512
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,399
no we're not doing the sort of hostage

513
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,160
rescue team thing where you slip it

514
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,600
through an air vent and then you

515
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,959
you know you're monitoring how many

516
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,480
people are still in the room and get the

517
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,279
patterns and

518
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,800
oh the guard's coming now the guard's

519
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,920
going uh no we're not that badass

520
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,600
and another bag of electronic spare

521
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,120
parts jumper wires

522
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,440
a lot of you know jumper bridge cables

523
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,240
usable

524
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,000
sometimes for elevator demos if we're

525
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,279
talking about what someone could do in a

526
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,240
controller

527
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
i wouldn't touch that howard payne could

528
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,759
although frankly he wouldn't touch that

529
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,800
either you don't mess with the

530
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,519
controller

531
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,360
a lot of times the extra wires i have

532
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,199
are just for bridging contacts inside of

533
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,679
access control cabinets

534
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,919
it's one of those funny things too like

535
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,079
just literally it's a bit of wire

536
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,520
let me go ahead and just pull one out

537
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,280
right this is nothing but

538
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,480
a bare chunk of freaking wire

539
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,679
wire when you wish you had wire is

540
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,520
ridiculous

541
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
it's one we're all electronics and

542
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,359
technical people right like

543
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,520
just finding a spare bit of wire i've

544
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
been on jobs where someone had to go

545
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,480
and find a phone and i just pulled a

546
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,919
piece of silver satin that was

547
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,360
you know plugging a convenience phone

548
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,120
into a wall i was like well i hope they

549
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,320
don't need that phone right there in the

550
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,600
cafeteria for a minute because i need

551
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,640
this wire and i was

552
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,320
ripping wires out of this piece of you

553
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,559
know this little cat three wire

554
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,039
that's ridiculous so always have a

555
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,720
couple of spare wires on you you never

556
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,840
know when you're gonna need to jump a

557
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,120
contact if you're doing electronic

558
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
shorting out

559
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,160
another bag i'm going to admit i haven't

560
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,280
opened this in a while i don't even know

561
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,160
what's in this bag

562
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,880
let's have a look

563
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,720
alright i know why i haven't opened this

564
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
in a while this is my i don't use it

565
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,400
much anymore but i'm not going to throw

566
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,840
it out bag

567
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,039
so sort of like old bump keys

568
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,880
we have a multi-lock interactive drilled

569
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
as a bump key we have a trio thing in

570
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,480
case i do you know a bunch of a bunch of

571
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,080
work in norway i could bump a lock in

572
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,360
norway i guess

573
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,640
so obscure bump keys we have an arrow

574
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,520
bump key in here we have okay yale depth

575
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,080
key

576
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
these are keys again i've cut on jobs

577
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,679
they're useful i don't use

578
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,440
screwdriver well i have the power

579
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,799
screwdriver now i don't always have the

580
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,799
manual screwdriver i also have a much

581
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,600
better

582
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
manual screwdriver for those who have

583
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,640
seen my

584
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,679
solve a lot of problems kit bag

585
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,440
vera oh my god vera tools

586
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,160
with not only conventional bits but

587
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,799
tamper

588
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,440
style bits the thing that's amazing

589
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,080
about where the german company

590
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,559
all of their bits have the little hollow

591
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,400
in the middle if you come across

592
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,440
torques if you come across hex they have

593
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,240
the tamper

594
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,039
already carved out so approaching

595
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,720
something like a tamper installed or a

596
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,000
resistant card reader

597
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,640
access control box a panel this is your

598
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,280
kit

599
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,440
i don't work for era very nice german

600
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,960
company manufactured in the czech

601
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,919
republic now

602
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,039
i just love their gear

603
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,880
also in the tools that i don't use a lot

604
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,000
but haven't gotten rid of

605
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
if you haven't seen a talk that i've

606
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
given before about copying keys from

607
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,720
clay molds

608
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,240
this is a cast and mold kit this is

609
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,919
polymer heat set clay this is a burns

610
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,960
torch

611
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,360
a little civil war reenactment melt your

612
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
lead shot kind of cup

613
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,679
yeah this is a kit where you actually

614
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,480
can take a mold a clay mold impression

615
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,960
of a key that you come across leave the

616
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
key exactly where you found it put it

617
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,679
back

618
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,559
and then later on using low melting

619
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,080
point metal

620
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
we actually use woods metal and fields

621
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
metal frankly this is just woods metal

622
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,440
because it's cheaper just don't you know

623
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,039
don't touch your face it's like covet

624
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,799
but with lead poisoning

625
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,840
uh yeah we we will make copies of keys

626
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,679
uh if you've never seen how to do that

627
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,000
i have a talk online about that copying

628
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,360
keys from photos molds and more

629
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
little release agent powder don't forget

630
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,640
to use the powder

631
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,320
when you are this is no it's not cocaine

632
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,679
to keep yourself going on those long

633
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,720
stakeout nights

634
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
now that is for copying keys from clay

635
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,720
molds

636
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,520
so right on uh have i used that in the

637
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:35,919
last

638
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,039
year no did i like it whenever i've

639
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,240
gotten to use it in the field

640
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,240
yes that's why this still sticks with me

641
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,720
one more from the here let's from the

642
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,480
department of old

643
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,320
right how many people in the audience

644
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,679
know what this is not what's in it

645
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,679
just this case the 80s are back

646
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,960
baby maybe even the 90s

647
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,159
you know this is this is a case

648
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,520
for cds remember you'd have one of these

649
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,600
like in your car with all the mix of the

650
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,080
hot summer mix 98 that you made on your

651
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,120
fork cdr burner uh and i think it's

652
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,880
appropriate that this case logic case

653
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,400
from best buy

654
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,960
is is here and how old it is because

655
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,200
what we have in it

656
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,640
is something equally old we have

657
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,159
tubular lock related tools so this is a

658
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,360
tubular pick set this is a tubular key

659
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,240
cutter

660
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,559
we have tubular depth gauges if you're

661
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,880
not familiar you totally tubular keys

662
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,080
man

663
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,799
tubular keys right they are not as

664
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,919
common anymore

665
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,840
as they once were very very prominent in

666
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,360
the field

667
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,360
but if you do encounter a tubular key

668
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,440
system it's not like you know we travel

669
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,799
with key machines we travel with hand

670
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,559
punch key machines we travel with

671
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,640
hpc blitz it's not like you're going to

672
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,320
make a tubular key on most

673
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,520
punch machines this is a manual

674
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,120
grinding style tubular key maker bad ass

675
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,559
i i think that is just an absolute who

676
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,280
so before we put away the penetration

677
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,720
case

678
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,039
what is in the actual bag the bag that

679
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,559
is typically

680
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,240
thrown over someone's shoulder unless

681
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,919
they're trying to be super low profile

682
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,440
this doesn't look quite like a

683
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,919
a tech company bag right if we have just

684
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,280
a messenger bag or

685
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,520
maybe something who is a peak design

686
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,880
that peak design makes the

687
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,720
bag really likes and he puts a lot of

688
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,080
gear in his peak design bag because it

689
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,000
looks very silicon valley

690
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,159
but this bag right here let's let's look

691
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,360
inside

692
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,679
the the penetration bag that is kind of

693
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,280
slung over a shoulder and it's always a

694
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,559
little different each time

695
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,640
it always depends on what kind of job i

696
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,400
was just on

697
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,960
but here we go all right quick access

698
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,559
what do you think is in the quick access

699
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,360
it's the bypass tools and such if you

700
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,520
have not ever seen

701
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
some of this all right we've got some

702
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,240
super easy to use field key these are

703
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,320
various server cabinet keys that are

704
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,440
incredibly common

705
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,840
i also have a verizon cabinet key that

706
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,919
you see will occasionally open verizon

707
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:10,640
field gear

708
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,400
i have to do a job as a verizon tech

709
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,919
we'll show you the shirt later

710
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,520
so that's a quick access kind of at the

711
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,960
top

712
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
what's in here one of my favorite tools

713
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,720
ever right we've got the traveler hook

714
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,360
bypass in those door latches use it

715
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,400
constantly

716
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,200
right in the top of the bag pre-cut but

717
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,000
unfolded

718
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,360
padlock shims i have definitely shim

719
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,799
some padlocks in the field

720
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,000
when necessary give them a try

721
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,600
why it's a cheap attack you can try it

722
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,120
before you that's for perimeter gates

723
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,080
and the like

724
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,880
and yeah the if you're not familiar with

725
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,799
the hammerless hinge pin tools these

726
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,240
hammerless punch tools

727
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,159
uh lockpickinglawyer featured them on

728
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,919
his channel when we showed them to him

729
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,360
at red team alliance

730
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,039
at our headquarters in virginia if

731
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,799
you're not familiar with that maybe i'll

732
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,400
i'll throw up some links i'll throw up

733
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
some some things like that later on

734
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,080
so you can take a look uh all the stuff

735
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,760
like the various attacks and other talks

736
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,640
i'm referencing

737
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
i'll try i'll rewatch this recording

738
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,000
i'll put a whole bunch of notes together

739
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,520
someone will throw it on a video

740
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
somewhere or i'm recording this too so

741
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,440
if the video eventually is not up if the

742
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,799
stream didn't record

743
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,400
i'll throw it up one way or another

744
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
gonna give you some information

745
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
back to the bag we've got some more

746
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,159
exterior pockets

747
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,760
what's on this front pocket anything

748
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
much yes

749
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,480
anybody who works in the culinary

750
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,159
industry if you've ever deboned a bunch

751
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,200
of fish

752
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,880
do you know what these are these

753
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,880
are anti-cut gloves they do not prevent

754
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,000
stabbing right you don't you don't don't

755
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,200
want to do this

756
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,520
but you can do this all day long this is

757
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,600
just me slashing at my hands here

758
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,640
if you are trying to scale a fence

759
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,520
if you are trying to get past razor wire

760
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,600
you can get it kind of out of your way

761
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,360
with gloves like this and work your way

762
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,279
around it remember though

763
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,279
only works for the splashing parts not

764
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,880
the poking bits

765
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,840
so don't learn that the hard way also

766
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,919
helpful around bushes brambles

767
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,960
uh things of that nature

768
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,480
moving on next pouch

769
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,200
in the front what's in the front anybody

770
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,720

771
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,679
twitter

772
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,039
the vera six shooter bits in the handle

773

774
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,320

775
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,320
esp key tools right this is my absolute

776
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,039
goddamn

777
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,559
favorite personal screwdriver you can

778
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,320
again switch the heads out it's quick

779
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,240
load quick release bits

780
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,039
this this is the tool man to have in

781
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,240
your back pocket

782
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,520
on a penetration job

783
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,440
bigger pouch here what's going on here

784
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,640
let's start pulling stuff out

785
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,400
ah all the lock pickers in the room just

786
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
got envious they're like how in the hell

787
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,840
did you get a sparrow you know

788
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,159
disc pick uh well because somebody in

789
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,120
the tool chat was

790
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,640
really kind and said hey do you guys

791
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,080
know sparrows is still in some of those

792
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,600
impossible to find kit picks

793
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,520
so i bought one uh i will look in the

794
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,279
tool slack and thank whoever that was

795
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,799
later

796
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,880
more tamper bits again because i don't

797
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,200
have my full suite of tamper bits here

798
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,760
i have tamper torques on here tiny

799
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,799
screwdrivers

800
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,400
a little thumb turn flipper if you're

801
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,240
not familiar

802
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,120
kind of whoop you ever seen one of those

803
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,320
you reach through the door sometimes

804
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,080
firemen will call these a j tool

805
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,840
you can absolutely operate locks from

806
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,720
the other side of the door

807
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,760
oh somebody's stuck to all right g what

808
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,919
what could be in here right pull that

809
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:38,960
off of there

810
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,520
but we have more you know tamper bits

811
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,880
and the like because occasionally you'll

812
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,559
come into odd fasteners

813
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,360
but definitely another magnet in here

814
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,799
bypassing those sensors

815
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,120
as needed a couple of wires for shorting

816
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,240
out wires

817
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,159
some jigglers and other you know bump

818
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,679
keys and the like that i've occasionally

819
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,520
used i use them less now but i will have

820
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,000
a jig

821
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,799
set or two on what are you jiggling

822
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,640
you're mostly jiggling something like

823
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,320
filing cabinet which you can open with a

824
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,840
regular pick set and i would have my

825
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,760
pick set on me separately

826
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,679
plug spinner one of those things you

827
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,440
will hate life if you wish you had a

828
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,320
plug spinner

829
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,640
and you don't have it in your bag so i

830
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,000
just finally started keeping the plug

831
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,039
spinner around

832
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,399
somebody's down in the front here

833
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,279
oh i think i know what these are these

834
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,039
are probably going to be assorted

835
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,320
bypass tools let's see yes

836
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,080
we have an atoms right bypass wire

837
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,919
oh we have a second atoms right bypass

838
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,279
wire because they break so easily is

839
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,039
this going to be the american lock

840
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,520
yes and we have an american lock bypass

841
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,399
driver

842
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,640
if you are curious what bypass driver

843
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,919
tools do

844
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,440
you could try to ask in the lockpick

845
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,600
village we don't always it depends every

846
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,360
lockpick village is a little different

847
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,200
where you draw the line between lock

848
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,640
picking and lock sport

849
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,520
and bypassing bypassing isn't really a

850
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,559
lock sport

851
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,399
endeavor so you won't always get a lot

852
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,320
of discussion about tools like that

853
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,240
but if you're curious about them hit me

854
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,760
up online if someone needs to tell you

855
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,320
about them i can explain them a bit

856
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,799
what is this is this a magic marker no

857
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,760
this is the world's

858
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,320
absolute worst pair of scissors so

859
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,039
terrible

860
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,720
that you will not wish you bought them

861
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,559
if you buy them but

862
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,120
they are really nondescript right they

863
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,200
they will slip past even sometimes

864
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,399
through a magnetometer

865
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,080
and if i can't have my multi-tool or

866
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,600
other blades which i do have on the

867
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
outside of my bag

868
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,720
not bad to have a pair of scissors

869
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,880
around

870
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,279
little electronic guy right here what is

871
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,320
it

872
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,919
this is known as a search pole

873
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,960
this is a magnetic tool

874
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,640
that will actually orient a and look for

875
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,399
magnetic fields you can even see

876
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,159
this little magnet is pivoting and

877
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,559
swinging through this field

878
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,399
you can use this to find magnetic

879
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,320
sensors and door frames and window

880
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,240
frames and window sills

881
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,799
we use this for bypassing you know doors

882
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,480
that we need to jump out the magnets on

883
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:04,960
you

884
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,600
need to get around that anything much

885
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
more buried in here

886
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,919
super old timey bump hammer i don't bump

887
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,679
a lot of locks open but when i do i

888
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,480
definitely use

889
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,799
a home brew hammer that was not

890
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,919
commercial in any way

891
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,919
pouch on the outside possibly going to

892
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,000
have my multi-tool in it unless no my

893
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,520
multi-tool is missing because i was

894
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,880
using it on a different uh

895
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,000
i was using it in the garage or

896
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,559
something like that anybody going on

897
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,799
over here oh what are you

898
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,000
literally folded pieces of plastic

899
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,760
these we have this is what is this can

900
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
anyone tell

901
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,559
that's a hotel room key and it's folded

902
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,399
and has a small piece of tape and what

903
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,440
is on that piece of tape

904
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,640
that piece of tape has a magnet on it

905
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,399
because this was a piece of tape with

906
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,799
the magnet and we slipped it into a door

907
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,120
to bypass a door sensor that's what all

908
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,159
of this is this is

909
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,080
tape and magnets and folded bits of

910
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,520
plastic

911
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,440
amazing and that's just about all

912
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,360
except one last thing and i will mention

913
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,200
it it's not a bad

914
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,679
thing to use and to have around and i

915
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,360
completely stole this from a hotel

916
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,480
kitchen or something where i was

917
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,279
breaking into some place

918
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,520
doorstop having a crappy little doorstop

919
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,279
that you can just jam into a door that

920
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,039
you don't want to close and it also kind

921
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,039
of looks like someone's working there

922
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,200
if somebody props the door open it's one

923
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,320
of those things that someone doesn't

924
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,799
want

925
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,240
that's more supposed to be is it not

926
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,399
supposed to be open being able to shove

927
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:34,880
that in

928
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,159
so you can quickly come back as needed

929
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,000
it's totally something i have done in

930
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,320
the past

931
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,399
so that just about does it for the first

932
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,799
case the penetration case but we have a

933
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,000
lot more here

934
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,320
how we doing on time we're doing great

935
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,080
on time you have 28 minutes left in the

936
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,480
hour

937
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,559
that is going to be just about perfect i

938
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,760
don't know if we've had any uh

939
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,519
commentary from the audience yet or any

940
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,880
further questions for what they've been

941
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,559
seeing

942
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,159
they are doing great right now all right

943
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:19,840
let's grab the next pelican case

944
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,320
okay let's see what we have

945
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,399
this is the case marked this is the most

946
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,159
boring one i'll tell you it's

947
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,240
this is just marked field gear you're

948
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,519
like wasn't that a bunch of field gear

949
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:33,840
no

950
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,600
that first pelican case was marked

951
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,960
penetration

952
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,159
field gear is usually in my mind when

953
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,080
you're kind of outside of the building

954
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,440
let's look at a few important things

955
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,519
though that are in here not the least of

956
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,600
which

957
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,159
a much better freaking dremel that plugs

958
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:50,960
in

959
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,200
yeah this is the one you want uh you

960
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,480
could tell that was the

961
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,080
i'm frustrated of throwing out the old

962
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,840
dremel and buying this one kind of gear

963
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,880
guys though what are these what

964
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,130
what the hell are these weird shapes

965
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,960
[Music]

966
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,200
these are called fence climbers

967
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,720
the idea is you can absolutely

968
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,360
pass this through a chain-link fence and

969
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,039
then let it hang down

970
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,760
and then now on both sides of the fence

971
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,120
you have

972
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,360
treads you can actually step all the way

973
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,480
up you can get

974
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,320
up a 12 foot fence in almost no time

975
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,039
putting one at a time as you go and then

976
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,440
pulling it out as you come back down

977
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,120
fence climbers not the easiest thing to

978
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,760
find usually in law enforcement catalog

979
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,799
zac tool used to make one z-a-k zac

980
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,799
i don't think they make these anymore uh

981
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,320
i don't know who these aren't zach's

982
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,760
because there are four of them zach was

983
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,440
a three-set

984
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,960
i will try to look this up though i'll

985
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,679
try to find which crazy military catalog

986
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,200
or i might have bought these from

987
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,559
somebody whose business card i got at

988
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,600
like shot show

989
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,679
uh but yeah i have totally used these

990
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,399
i've used these to scale fences

991
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,240
one more thing about scaling oh yeah

992
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,440
another grabber arm

993
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,799
quick deploy this is the rapid

994
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,880
deployment grab arm

995
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,640
with a little weird safety interlock

996
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,559
thief there we go

997
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,760
uh scaling fences there is literally

998
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,279
a ladder in here there is a this is like

999
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,320
one of those

1000
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,559
child safety get out of the bedroom

1001
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,360
ladders

1002
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,679
and we spread it out we spray painted

1003
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,840
the whole damn thing black

1004
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,120
we covered the treads with uh you know

1005
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,559
like grip tape these are little stoppers

1006
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,559
that go like on the bottom of canes or

1007
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,240
something i don't know what i think i

1008
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,880
cleaned out a drugstore and i because i

1009
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,320
because normally it's just metal right

1010
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,159
and if you hang this on a fence or a

1011
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,760
wall metal against the

1012
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,480
clang clang bang clang i didn't want

1013
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,600
that so i just

1014
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,519
covered the whole thing in black paint

1015
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,039
matte black and i put a little rubber

1016
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:53,679
feet

1017
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,960
on all the treads and we were

1018
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,720
what we did is we used there are super

1019
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,080
long extendable poles

1020
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,840
that you can get that you can use for

1021
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,519
changing light fixtures

1022
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,679
we found those at like a hardware store

1023
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,440
and we got these long extensible poles

1024
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,199
we kind of attached it to the end

1025
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,040
and just fished all the way up a wall

1026
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,719
because remember the top of those escape

1027
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,480
ladders are big hooks

1028
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,239
so we got these hooks way up on top of

1029
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,918
the wall we could see it was just a flat

1030
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,199
concrete wall

1031
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,960
and someone who was you know with eyes

1032
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,560
remotely looking from a hill they're

1033
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,079
like oh dude yeah you're super over that

1034
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,839
wall who's gonna go for it

1035
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,359
climbed right up the frickin wall there

1036
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,800
you go and then we threw a different

1037
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,359
rope ladder on the other side

1038
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,599
what is this is this is this for soft

1039
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,800
landings on the other side

1040
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,960
or is it for i'm going to yoga practice

1041
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,719
as a you know social engineering

1042
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,320
no i don't yoga laying down in the dirt

1043
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
with your eyes on a target on really

1044
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,079
cold evenings just putting eyes on

1045
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,520
target

1046
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,000
dirt is colder than you think having a

1047
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,839
little foam mat like that

1048
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,879
is a lifesaver oh my god on really cold

1049
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,119
kind of stakeout nights

1050
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,800
speaking of stakeout nights i mean yes

1051
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,520
of course camo fabric we have got a ton

1052
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,200
of camouflage gear you'll see things

1053
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,880
elsewhere having

1054
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,359
various kinds of knee pads if you are

1055
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:07,920
doing

1056
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,560
any sort of digging tunneling trenching

1057
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,119
this is why

1058
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,599
this is called the field gear case right

1059
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,720
we are

1060
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,839
doing really filthy horrible beat

1061
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,680
yourself up kind of work

1062
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,800
uh getting down into oh dude this is one

1063
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,440
super props to uh i think matt pointed

1064
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,480
this out to me i don't know matt's in

1065
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,520
the audience right

1066
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,280
i he needed one i was like oh i

1067
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,119
don't have one of those tools

1068
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,520
i should order one of those tools

1069
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,320
getting down

1070
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,200
into access tunnels simple look at this

1071
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,520
tool on this table here

1072
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,800
super simple tool this is a manhole

1073
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,280
cover remover

1074
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,720
four or five dollars or something on

1075
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,640
amazon and i put a couple of little soft

1076
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,359
uh you know

1077
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,359
rubber bits on the handle but oh my god

1078
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,800
being able to actually

1079
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,640
not just lift a manhole cover the right

1080
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,480
way but you look like you belong there

1081
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,280
right

1082
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,720
looking like you should do you know what

1083
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,960
you're doing is a big part of getting

1084
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,800
into spaces where you don't belong so

1085
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,960
having that little hook tool definitely

1086
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,599
important to me

1087
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,599
hand warmers not just when you're

1088
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,280
freezing on cold nights but sometimes

1089
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,000
trying to set off

1090
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,079
thermal sensors on the inside of doors

1091
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,599
yes that goes in the field we wound up

1092
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,320
using them

1093
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,560
way more often in the field just that

1094
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,079
way

1095
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,839
i even have more of these little rubber

1096
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,520
feet this must have been um

1097
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,920
i don't know how many rubber feet i

1098
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,520
bought but i remember at one point on

1099
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,119
the job we were setting them up

1100
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,880
and using them like little bowling pins

1101
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,160
in the airbnb

1102
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,000
because we were like waiting for a call

1103
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,599
from a point of contact and

1104
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,520
we just had uh tons of eyes out on the

1105
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,040
target recording footage

1106
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,640
and i remember rolling gaff tape and

1107
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,079
knocking these down in a game of you

1108
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,839
know 10 pins

1109
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,200
speaking of eyes on target

1110
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,240
dash cams dash cams or gopros if you

1111
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,599
want to get super expensive we have a

1112
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,359
bunch of gopros in the fleet

1113
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,480
having these mounted in vehicles we have

1114
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,480
absolutely parked vehicles near a target

1115
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,480
and just let a dash cam play just let

1116
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,560
footage roll as long as you can

1117
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,599
fill up that memory card understand

1118
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,280
how this thing will operate with or

1119
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,599
without power uh we have been in rental

1120
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,400
cars

1121
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,200
where the cigarette lighter would be on

1122
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,800
if the car was on

1123
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,640
then you'd turn the car off and the

1124
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,160
cigarette lighter still had power so

1125
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,480
like cool sweet this dash cam will work

1126
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,000
but then five minutes after that it

1127
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,920
would cut off and then five minutes

1128
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,280
after that the dash cam would go off and

1129
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,599
if

1130
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,240
we go out there every five hours why is

1131
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,880
there only

1132
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,800
15 minutes of freaking footage what is

1133
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,320
going on

1134
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,800
test all that at hq or at your airbnb or

1135
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
ever before you go out to the field

1136
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,000
we wound up just using a you know

1137
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,560
battery bank like an anchor power supply

1138
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,800
that worked better uh but yeah test that

1139
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,240
kind of stuff out man you run into

1140
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,839
things like this

1141
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,520
what on earth is even in this case i

1142
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,800
don't know what's in here but it's was i

1143
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,960
trying to protect it is it sensitive

1144
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,680
yeah it is a little sensitive okay you

1145
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,000
know what's in here

1146
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,040
again you don't have to be freaking

1147
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,359
james bond the spy with all of the

1148
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,800
expensive gear

1149
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,079
these are these are amazon specials babe

1150
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,040
these are usb or in the case of this

1151
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,880
case you know i have a little c adapter

1152
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,359
put on my phone but these are crappy

1153
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,200
little digital telescopes

1154
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,160
and i have you know a tiny rinky dink

1155
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,359
tripod

1156
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,400
whenever you're doing any kind of

1157
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,880
telescope work your hand is not steady

1158
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,440
your hand will always weeble wobble

1159
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,520
get even the crappiest tripod ever put

1160
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,280
it up on some rocks

1161
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,440
or you know i have a proper tripod in

1162
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,640
here

1163
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,160
this is something that you can again you

1164
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,560
can capture proof of concept footage

1165
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,599
you can show people i was able to be

1166
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,920
on this hill at the edge of property

1167
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,280
getting footage and monitoring your

1168
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,119
security activities

1169
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,000
now if you need really good footage that

1170
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,880

1193
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,839
badass

1194
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,359
that is the field gear though not the

1195
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,359
sexiest case but it's the kind of thing

1196
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,720
on those cold nights or in the long

1197
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,839
distances that you're

1198
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,079
covered in filth digging under a wall

1199
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,839
it's good to have some of that there

1200
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,280
let's look at the last one and it's a

1201
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,119
fun case let's look at the social

1202
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,079
engineering case

1203
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:57,839
excuse me frankie

1204
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,720
okay who's ready for this right are we

1205
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,920
are we still enjoying ourselves we

1206
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,040
haven't gotten a lot of audience

1207
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,560
commentary we had any questions as we've

1208
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,839
been going or anything like that

1209
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,280
actually we have a wonderful comment

1210
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,440
from the audience uh drew porter is

1211
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,000

1212
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,119

1213
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,160
made by drew porter

1214
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,000
i have no idea but that would be great

1215
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,200
though if drew is in there

1216
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
it's gary oh yeah oh right on of

1217
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,200

1218
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,160
and justin are talking

1219
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,640
later today uh so yes don't don't miss

1220
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,079
that so i think after me

1221
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,560
i think dj ome is probably talking uh

1222
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,000
and then i think gary and justin are

1223
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,280
after that so

1224
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,920
uh like b-side seattle props to all the

1225
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,599
talent that they pull in

1226
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,920
uh i am i'm amazed every time whenever i

1227
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,160
get to stick my head in

1228
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,760
social engineering what do we got here

1229
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,680
well you know it's the kind of stuff

1230
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,040
you'd expect

1231
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,000
it is it is humorous it is fun to watch

1232
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,680
it is fun to see

1233
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,440
and i'm just i'm here to fix the

1234
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,960
elevators and stuff right

1235
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,040
like i've got i've got my employee badge

1236
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,000
hanging from an otis lanyard and

1237
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,839
you know yeah i've got uh i got it what

1238
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,040
you got a problem with the thing yeah

1239
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,640
i've got to make sure i can let me badge

1240
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,079
into that with my badge that doesn't

1241
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,520
work or maybe it does because i stole

1242
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,119
your credentials

1243
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,960
these are these are social engineering

1244
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,400
outfits

1245
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,359
yes i do plenty of elevator type work so

1246
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,880
if i want to be the elevator person or

1247
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,760
if i want to

1248
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,240
be the elevator person in cold weather

1249
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,680
how many of you would be surprised to

1250
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,480
learn

1251
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,440
that otis elevator because they're

1252
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,720
moving people

1253
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,960
otis elevator has a shop that is public

1254
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,920
facing

1255
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,760
so if if you want to go ahead and get

1256
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,280
yourself some elevator gear

1257
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,560
i didn't get it through any special

1258
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,160
industry connections i just you know

1259
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,200
clicked with my mouse

1260
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,760
complete the outfit complete the look

1261
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,520
get some i-viz going on

1262
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,560
not all hi-vis is created equal right

1263
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,720
look at your target facility are they

1264
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,920
wearing

1265
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,800
yellow with orange are they wearing just

1266
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,680
yellow

1267
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,160
are they crazy old and only wearing

1268
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,240
orange which is not common anymore

1269
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,800
unless you're you know hunting um yellow

1270
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
has become the default high vis but

1271
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,960
again find out what what are the crew

1272
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,720
what is the crew wearing

1273
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,960
get the correct high vis if you want to

1274
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,319
look like you're part of the crew that

1275
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,839
the employee has seen working in the

1276
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,359
area

1277
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,960
similarly if you want to look like you

1278
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,040
belong in the area

1279
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,200
you don't just go out and buy a single

1280
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,079
helmet like

1281
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,720
oh i got myself a helmet no you want to

1282
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,079
let's let's take a look at this on the

1283
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,160
close cam right

1284
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,480
you want that helmet to be beat the hell

1285
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,079
up and you also

1286
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,760
want to just throw you know get some

1287
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,599
local sports team stickers

1288
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,480
get some union stickers on there get get

1289
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,319
just any kind of crap you can with it

1290
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:40,720
just

1291
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,680
really yeah sell the sell the story

1292
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,839
right

1293
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,079
thank you more outfits

1294
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,119
that we got in here let's see

1295
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,560
well that was a client we're not going

1296
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,560
to show them but we we definitely had

1297
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,160
stolen something from a data center or

1298
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,200
two

1299
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,720
thankfully was overseas you might not

1300
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,640
know uh fire inspector

1301
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,800
absolutely now be careful with with

1302
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,400
representing authority right

1303
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,800
all of you should know you are not a

1304
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,839
police officer

1305
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,359
ever you do not pretend to be law

1306
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,040
enforcement you cannot be a sworn

1307
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,160
officer you can let people think

1308
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,880
that you're somebody official if you are

1309
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,280
just

1310
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,960
posture you say well i'm here to i'm

1311
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,720
inspecting a problem i heard there was a

1312
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,599
you know whatever

1313
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,280
you do not present fake credentials you

1314
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,520
do not claim to be law enforcement

1315
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,079
another tricky one not as likely to get

1316
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,920
you in hot water but be careful

1317
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,160
and that is representing yourself as a

1318
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,520
lawyer

1319
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,000
practicing law without a license is a

1320
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,720
thing

1321
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,079
i don't think anyone would really call

1322
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,000
it the practice of law if you said i'm

1323
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,200
delivering the subpoena

1324
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,280
but have you ever gotten like a subpoena

1325
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,640
or a blue back or anything

1326
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,040
from a lawyer no you get that from a

1327
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,640
process server from some guy in a

1328
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,319
flannel shirt whose whole job

1329
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,480
is to sit in their car and wait until

1330
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,839
the subject comes out of the building

1331
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,200
and then run up to them and be like mr

1332
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,480
smith this is yours

1333
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,119
so yeah you don't have to be a lawyer

1334
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,800

1342
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,119
walk around the building noticing all

1343
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,200
the stuff you're going to exploit later

1344

be a whole separate talk

1368
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,760

1374
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,160
distance

1375
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,880
it's possible to look like you belong

1376
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,319
there

1377
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,160

1382
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,720
vaguely like the right badge and there

1383
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,079
you go

1384
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,920
so there's a lot more we could talk

1385
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,280
about there are other things i'm not

1386
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,240
going to pull out my

1387
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,520
old man gramps kane do we have any

1388
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,800
questions from the audience in the

1389
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,480
minute or two before we have to wrap

1390
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,240
up this was this was a hoot i haven't

1391
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
done this in a while

1392
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,920
well we have three questions from the

1393
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,440
audience and you've got

1394
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,200
five six seven minutes to answer and

1395
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,640
it's great we've got the first one

1396
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,040
is this one my favorite question ever

1397
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,400
what is the must-have

1398
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,720
tool for someone just starting on walk

1399
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,760
by passing

1400
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,839
the must-have tool for lock bypassing is

1401
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,200
the traveler hook

1402
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,319
hands down traveler hook to exploit bad

1403
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,440
door latches

1404
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,920
because that's an actual tool right like

1405
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,200
that's a tool that's

1406
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,359
you can't just pick up off the ground

1407
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,720
having a

1408
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,319
latch slipping with like a flexible

1409
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,160
piece of plastic anyone can just source

1410
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,720
that

1411
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,040
get the traveler hook it's small it'll

1412
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,319
fit in your back pocket

1413
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,440
always have it what's next all right

1414
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,240
what's next what is the best way to

1415
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,640
learn these skills and not get arrested

1416
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,880
justin and gary's style i didn't ask

1417
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,480
this i think that's going to be their

1418
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,760
talk right their talk is going to be

1419
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,119
about what went wrong

1420
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,480
and most of the things that went wrong

1421
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,160
for justin and gary were not things they

1422
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,760
were doing wrong

1423
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,680
there was a there was a great event that

1424
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,760
was called awareness con

1425
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,040
and john strand and his whole crew

1426
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,200
ran that and it was all about talking

1427
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,040
about the right or wrong way

1428
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,440
to engage with the community and do pen

1429
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,040
testing and say you know

1430
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,599
how to how to build bridges i was pretty

1431
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,040
happy with some of the talks that were

1432
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,520
given at awareness con i think and i i

1433
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,280
i know that coal fire had a lot to say

1434
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,520
on this front as well i would also say

1435
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,359
big thanks to coal fire there is the

1436
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,319
protecting ethical hackers initiative

1437
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,079
that is something that they have started

1438
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,079
it is a mailing list a working group

1439
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,160
and a lot of good research is being done

1440
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,359
there an effort that's going to carry

1441
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,319
the industry hopefully

1442
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,680
very very forward wonderful

1443
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,760
we have uh well i thought we had one

1444
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,119
last question we've actually got two or

1445
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,079
three more

1446
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,760
we've got another six minutes to go

1447
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,520
before the end of your talk so

1448
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,839
cool our question here is what is

1449
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,640
the strangest piece of gear or clothing

1450
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,040
you have ever used on a contract and do

1451

1453
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,720
piece of gear or clothing that i've ever

1454
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,440

1455
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,359

1462
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,359
kind of authority going on

1463

1498
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,200
something that light's blinking

1499
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,240
speaking of crazy things that you do how

1500
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,760
do you get your cases through the

1501
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,760
airport check bags

1502
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,200
i give a whole talk about flying with

1503
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,280
firearms any of this crap can check

1504
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,359
the magnets are weird do you understand

1505
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,760
that many airport scanning materials

1506
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,880
that those are magnet based not just um

1507
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,800
like a ferrometer right just a

1508
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,079
magnetometer

1509
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,240
uses magnetic field sympathetic fields

1510
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,839
to detect metal

1511
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,760
your magnets will go bananas in that but

1512
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,960
also

1513
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,559
the ones they're essentially almost like

1514
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,559
mri machines the the through the you

1515
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:52,960
know the

1516
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,119
who the hell makes them uh rapiscan

1517
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,359
right those machines the um

1518
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,079
that they will they will get weird

1519
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,359
results on the screen with a heavy

1520
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,160
enough magnet

1521
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,680
in there because it bends the actual

1522
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,359
fields it bends you know the

1523
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,440
em fields so you might get some

1524
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,559
questions

1525
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,480
but all of this that you've seen and

1526
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,480
more is legal in airport check

1527
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,599
bags thus far speaking of legal as a

1528
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,680
result of the coal fire incident

1529
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,160
have you or your teams taken any extra

1530
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,319
precautions to minimize risk and if so

1531
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,599
what are they uh yeah are we taking more

1532
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,280
precautions to minimize

1533
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,440
risk well i'm a third-party contractor

1534
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,359
you can see so it's not my job i don't

1535
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,160
really belong here

1536
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,520
yes the the true answer though to

1537
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,599
minimize risk um

1538
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,000
we are always a little more cognizant

1539
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,880
now

1540
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,240
of the language in certain contracts

1541
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,480
uh the talk about the ultimate i never

1542
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,480
thought it could happen to me moment

1543
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,119
was when and justin and gary will talk

1544
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,319
about this in their talk

1545
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,720
the point of contact who was on the

1546
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,760
letter

1547
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,440
literally there's more than one point of

1548
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,119
contact on those authorizing letters

1549
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,559
and the guy wasn't even there like

1550
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,480
didn't answer his phone just poofed in

1551
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,359
the wind

1552
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,760
uh normally the point of contacts on our

1553
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,520
letter are our direct point of contact

1554
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,800
on the job

1555
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
so like we're at this like hey man we're

1556
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,079
gonna do that thing all right we're

1557
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:10,800
checking in with you

1558
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,800
we're like constantly talking but on

1559
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,640
bigger jobs government jobs like they

1560
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,280
were on

1561
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,720
you might have somebody with a bunch of

1562
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,960
juice who is the authorizing party

1563
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,559
but that person is effed off to a

1564
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,319
conference in dc or they're in another

1565
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,079
time zone or another state

1566
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,800
and not just that's a crazy thing but i

1567
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,119
would

1568
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,319
tell everyone check in during daytime

1569
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:31,920
hours you're not pissing people off

1570
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,760
check in with those two numbers on that

1571
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,359
letter and say hey

1572
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,440
just verifying are you the person are

1573
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,800
you there you don't tell them you're

1574
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,920
like breaking in right now

1575
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,599
because maybe they're vested in you

1576
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,000
being caught but have somebody get them

1577
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,800
on the phone

1578
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,800
from you know social engineering be like

1579
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,960
hello this is susie with what verizon

1580
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,240
wireless are you happy with your plan

1581
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,000
just make sure someone's answering that

1582
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,800
phone

1583
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,079
so that's something i would definitely

1584
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,680
say but talk watch their talk later

1585
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,160
today

1586
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,319
you get a lot more uh data out of them

1587
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,920
and more advice i'm sure

1588
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,760
and last question building on social

1589
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,520
engineering we have a question or two

1590
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,160
now

1591
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,599
social engineering is incredibly

1592
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,599
difficult um last question

1593
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,040
how do you get started in learning all

1594
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,720
of this how do you get started and

1595
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,160
social engineering is difficult yeah

1596
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,280
it's so difficult that i

1597
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,520
gave me a limp i gotta use my cane can

1598
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,440
you get the door open for me please

1599
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,280
um yes how do you learn social

1600
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,880
engineering well there are

1601
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,640
frankly very good trainers operating in

1602
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,960
this space i know that someone who we

1603
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,559
have worked with and talks on she talks

1604
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,160
on twitter all the time jack hyde

1605
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,839
is an amazing speaker who has talked

1606
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,000
about this i know that snow from snow

1607
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,640
offensive

1608
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,640
has talked about social engineering the

1609
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,640
entire human hacker crew right they run

1610
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,079
the se village

1611
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,000
wonderful showmanship in addition to

1612
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,480
education from that event

1613
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,720
uh yeah it's a lot of it just comes from

1614
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,160
do it do it until you're comfortable

1615
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,280
with it it's flight time

1616
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,760
right uh it's it's weird to lie to

1617
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,240
people until lying to people is your job

1618
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,400
and at that point does it matter like

1619
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,599
you just all like and because

1620
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,000
lie when there's no stakes literally

1621
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,680
you're checking out of a store

1622
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,119
and they want your home phone number and

1623
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,960
zip code

1624
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,480
none of us want to give our real info

1625
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,559
but don't decline just lie

1626
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,400
know someone's real info know the white

1627
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,680
house phone number

1628
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,520
know the white house zip code just lie

1629
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,599
lie all the time

1630
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,119
and get good at it when there's no

1631
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,440
stakes involved

1632
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,559
yeah that's my advice lie

1633
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,040
constantly it will serve you well

1634
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,960
i think that's about we that was just

1635
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,800
