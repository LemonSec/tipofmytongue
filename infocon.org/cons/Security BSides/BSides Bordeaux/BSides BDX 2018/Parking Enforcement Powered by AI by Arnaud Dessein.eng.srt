1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:10,320
really links security both in digital

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:15,219
and physical works quite interesting for

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:18,550
for this comprehend so excuse it means

4
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:24,189
Concha fight cities so our vision is

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:27,520
that many efforts have been made last

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:30,550
decade to understand behavior of people

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,540
online like understanding where you will

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:38,050
click what you will buy like on shopping

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:41,559
ecommerce sites and any kind of site on

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,989
Facebook understanding why you like

11
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:44,559
these things how you relate to other

12
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:48,428
people

13
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,230
some people IDs you will buy this kind

14
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:54,399
of stuff

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:55,959
so a lot of efforts have been made for

16
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,640
understanding this kind of behavior

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:03,210
online and the consequences you have

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,700
know for example personalized

19
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,520
advertisement and stuff like this so our

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,979
ambition to cities kind of understand

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,719
the behavior of people of people but on

22
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:28,930
the inside you see in the physical so

23
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:30,839
it's complex messy and our pain is and

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,579
mission is to once we have understood

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,869
the behavior of people we want to

26
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:40,929
improve their everyday life so we we

27
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:44,469
have several we call them articles this

28
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:48,960
kind of field we work for the main one

29
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:53,439
is about mobility we try to to

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,880
understand why people will use vehicle

31
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,419
car bike

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,339
depending on the

33
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,229
the weather out the day of the weed our

34
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:07,179
and many contextual features were very

35
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:09,889
products in so for example we walk for

36
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:10,399
share the vehicles like for example in

37
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,958
Bordeaux

38
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:18,110
you know the cube company they have the

39
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:21,050
bicycles you can rent at some stations

40
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:24,519
so we would fall for them we predict the

41
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:29,840
demand the demand of bikes

42
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,440
station to optimize the distribution in

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,989
the city

44
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,269
we also walk parking so I will talk

45
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:38,620
about this later your throttle work

46
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:42,319
abroad safety so we predict incidents on

47
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,989
highways for example we work my way from

48
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:51,048
border to Bayonne and we helped the

49
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:53,450
operator to patrol I were in order to

50
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:55,519
prevent the incidents and in case

51
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:00,410
there's an accident or something bad

52
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,350
happening we we help him put the

53
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:07,040
resources at the right place so it can

54
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:12,230
can be on the site of incidents fraud

55
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:15,290
time to intervene we also walk with the

56
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,290
urban planners and cities to improve

57
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,890
urban design or so street cleaning and

58
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:25,070
sweeping and things like this so

59
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,890
basically how we can do this we have one

60
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:30,920
main core technology to address all of

61
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:34,880
these issues it's based on the three

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,858
main steps the first steps is collecting

63
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,620
and processing a lot of data about the

64
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:42,170
city so for example who collects a lot

65
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,959
of data about the urban infrastructure

66
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:48,500
we know where the roads streets where

67
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,500
the shops hotels restaurants parks trees

68
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,060
whatever we have like hundreds of

69
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:58,730
features about to describe an induced

70
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,879
we also have some events of interest it

71
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:05,719
can be a football football game it can

72
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:09,469
be concerts we also have data but the

73
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:12,439
traffic many kinds of the Italians

74
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:14,150
describe the city we also have like

75
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,180
weather information we know if it's

76
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,320
raining so need the pressure or the wind

77
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,299
speed and direction

78
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,289
many very specific features about

79
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:26,840
weather conditions also we use lot of

80
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:30,650
calendar information because people will

81
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,909
have different behaviors on Sunday

82
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:38,900
Wednesday in the morning evening if it's

83
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,880
summer winter if it's good or a day or

84
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:44,359
it's just a business we classical is

85
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,570
next week so we have all of this data

86
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,870
that you utilize the city and the

87
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:57,289
computer is able to have likely if you

88
00:04:50,870 --> 00:05:00,919
are on playing the scenes the computer

89
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:04,969
model of the environment and on top of

90
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,830
this data we also grab and collected

91
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,199
customer data depending on these

92
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,389
programs for example you want to predict

93
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,000
how many people will take a bite at the

94
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,639
station and how many people will need to

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,690
put the bank bank back in another

96
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,180
station we change bike dates are from

97
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:27,740
the the bike operator so for example in

98
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:30,110
Bordeaux every minute in all of the 170

99
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,240
stations every minute we have a snapshot

100
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,789
of how many bikes are there and we need

101
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,180
dogs are free to leave a bike and we

102
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:39,800
collect all of this data so this is the

103
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,590
example for the bike but for example for

104
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,260
the road track road incidents we also

105
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,969
correct all cheer occasions in times 10

106
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,360
the incidents happening on the highway

107
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,850
and so on for deals are kind of problems

108
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,980
we tackle and so this is the first part

109
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,260
once we have collected and processed all

110
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:01,070
of this data we can apply artificial

111
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:04,490
intelligence algorithms so what does it

112
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:08,330
mean we have some algorithms and models

113
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:10,340
that learn the behavior of people based

114
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,659
on all the data we have processed so for

115
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:17,900
example the algorithm will learn that on

116
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:21,560
Friday at 6 p.m. a lot of people will

117
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:25,039
take some bikes near the walking areas

118
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,770
and go to the city center maybe to have

119
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,680
a dream or watch restaurants and so on

120
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:34,030
so the based on the historical data and

121
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:38,450
of the context of the city your tourism

122
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:41,330
infer why people take more bikes at this

123
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,700
particular location in China and once

124
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,710
the model are sufficiently trained we

125
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,890
can go to the last step

126
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:51,169
optimize services once during the

127
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,810
algorithm are trained on the past data

128
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:57,290
they are able to predict accurately what

129
00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:00,890
will happen in two hours and three days

130
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:05,000
in one week and we provide these

131
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:07,130
predictions to our customers and on top

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,170
of all our services and applications to

133
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:14,530
optimize service

134
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:18,610
so I will show you one example of

135
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:23,200
applications to parking enforcement here

136
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:26,620
our customers so we are a subject from

137
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,020
border but we work the mini cities in

138
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,850
France we're starting to rock in Europe

139
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,049
like in Amsterdam in Belgium in the

140
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,170
absalom and Belgium in Europe for now

141
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,420
and we have also offices in New York

142
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,680
since we won an acceleration program

143
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,570
last year called

144
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,330
your box so we have offices in Brooklyn

145
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:51,219
as well and we are now starting some

146
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:55,030
some pilots in the US as well this is

147
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,700
our team we are mainly tech people as

148
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,820
many engineers we are a lot of

149
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:03,479
scientists and back-end engineers there

150
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:08,500
are couple of people doing the business

151
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:11,380
stuff but we are no Irene because we are

152
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,980
growing we just found out so we just

153
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,440
finished our seating from founding wrong

154
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,820
and we are I ring people so our own

155
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,400
business development if you are

156
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,740
interested and also many people for the

157
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,960
infrastructure tech tech box so if you

158
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,800
are interested in that engineering data

159
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:34,169
science develops we are your positions

160
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,169
for this kind of work

161
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,490
so that that's the global picture about

162
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:44,870
use it now I will just talk about one

163
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:48,710
product really related to security and

164
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:50,150
in frosting security compliance with the

165
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:56,050
low end and regulations

166
00:08:50,150 --> 00:09:01,540
it's about parking enforcement who here

167
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:01,540
I've like parking find I mean this job

168
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:17,240
in the States so why I'm asking this

169
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:20,540
because this year in France there was a

170
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,810
new reform that's about the penalization

171
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,199
or decriminalization of parking pay

172
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,949
parking previously pay parking was

173
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:33,080
national national map matter

174
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:37,100
there was like uniform fine all over

175
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,500
France and police was regulating all of

176
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,360
this but starting from the frost of

177
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:45,830
generators here it says it has been

178
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,270
deputized and now every city can choose

179
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,990
to choose how it how she will regulate

180
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,300
parking enforcement

181
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,580
so she the city can choose the Hammond

182
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:59,030
the amount of the fines she can choose

183
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:03,590
who will control now private companies

184
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:05,870
can control not only the police so there

185
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,270
are have been many changes in behaviors

186
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,280
of people in and behaviors also of

187
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,900
cities regarding parking enforcement for

188
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,600
example before the reform in France

189
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,630
there was an average of 30 percent

190
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,000
payment rate it means more than how

191
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:23,010
people were not paying

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,990
in Paris it was like 10% people pay

193
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:30,810
partly in Bordeaux it was half of them

194
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:34,620
so now a couple of months after the

195
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,869
reform it has changed to be behaviour of

196
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,380
people for example in Paris it has

197
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:47,790
tripled the number in the Belgian border

198
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:48,270
it's quite reasonable now 70% 80% if we

199
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,579
go

200
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,050
you know some countries in Europe

201
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,990
several years ago they had they had

202
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,839
already chosen to depolarize by parking

203
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:01,500
for example the United Kingdom and Spain

204
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:09,390
where the respect rate went from about

205
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:12,390
30% to 19% couple of years so for us the

206
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:16,560
fact that when enforcement was denied in

207
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:19,140
France was a great a great signal for us

208
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,010
to to work on this kind of problem and

209
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:25,080
optimize how can we make how can we

210
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,330
predict behavior of people and make them

211
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:33,570
change their behaviors to comply with

212
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:38,459
the law if we go worldwide studios chain

213
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:40,860
in Europe so for example in France once

214
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:42,329
the street is that only paid parking has

215
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,550
been dippin alized but if you go through

216
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,459
some countries what kind of parking up

217
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,079
indefinite as I was as well for example

218
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:51,959
reserved parking has been the penalized

219
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,529
in Belgium and it runs no way the the

220
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,719
most visionary conformation is the UK

221
00:11:55,529 --> 00:12:00,499
which that's the penalized all kinds of

222
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,369
parking so for example even

223
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:10,549
when companies can can impress people

224
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:17,859
that's badly parked on spots for what we

225
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:17,858
call reduce mobility people people with

226
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:26,629
so in France is just for paid parking

227
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:29,029
now but my changes in the world there

228
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:33,259
are many I will not talk about all the

229
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:35,509
cities but many cities that I made lots

230
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,429
of efforts towards better enforcement in

231
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:39,739
parking management and the only things

232
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:42,379
to remember too you know here is the the

233
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:45,499
choice of the technology as as revealed

234
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:48,319
to be the main level of efficiency for

235
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:52,159
example the parking meters that are

236
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:55,459
connected to control teams so that you

237
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:58,129
know the the plates of the car the team

238
00:12:55,459 --> 00:13:01,608
knows how much is paid and how long we

239
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:04,609
can stay for it has been a major level

240
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:06,189
of efficiency so in this context up to

241
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:08,989
seats

242
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:11,779
we will use all of this data to predict

243
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:15,499
to the control team where and where and

244
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:20,329
when which go and cross party to improve

245
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:23,419
the system so the expected consequences

246
00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:25,789
are trust people with comply with the

247
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:28,609
rules that's right

248
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:31,159
but what is more interesting in the long

249
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:34,309
term is a reduction of the traffic in

250
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,529
the city centers broad congestion and it

251
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:38,930
will promote access to the city centers

252
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:44,199
for example for people

253
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:48,680
and our shops they often complain that

254
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:52,160
center of our crew cannot be accessed by

255
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:55,339
the hikers and they lose money so this

256
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,189
is one of the the effect another effect

257
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,980
is the financial gains people paying now

258
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:02,868
the parking can be reinvested in better

259
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,600
and more durable infrastructures for

260
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:09,319
example in public transportation tram

261
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,110
bus Metro also what we call in France

262
00:14:09,319 --> 00:14:13,878
backing on it it's a big parking of

263
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,920
street parking when you can just leave

264
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:20,089
your car in the city suburbs and then

265
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,459
take the public transportation to go to

266
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:24,829
the center and the last effects in the

267
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:28,429
long term is reduction in the pollution

268
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:30,649
and better improved quality oh yeah so

269
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:33,079
this is the consequence the effects we

270
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:43,759
we expect you to a person with such

271
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:46,359
improvements so to achieve this we have

272
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,980
glided from step of data science

273
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,050
basically it's often described in four

274
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,329
steps descriptive diagnostic predictive

275
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:57,170
and prescriptive so descriptive would be

276
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:59,809
for example I collect the data from my

277
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:03,709
customer and I say okay this is how

278
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:06,649
evolves the the rate of payment day by

279
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:10,670
day you see some Peaks but it's not very

280
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:12,319
helpful to help him to tell him go and

281
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,939
control at this place at this popular

282
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:16,939
particular time it's really factual

283
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:19,610
observation here it's not actionable by

284
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:22,849
the enforcement in on the field you can

285
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:25,850
here is a map where the green points are

286
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,000
people who are paid in red points that

287
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,910
they haven't

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,490
it read appends on the hour of the day

289
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:36,150
you don't really know where you should

290
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:38,850
go when it's only descriptive

291
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,220
information if you go a step further and

292
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,100
do some Diagnostics you can compute like

293
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:47,040
statistical averages and say okay it

294
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,560
seems like by the end of the week less

295
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,740
people are paying maybe that's as you

296
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:56,010
can see here is the average in blue but

297
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:59,570
the red is the maximum and the yellow is

298
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:03,300
the minimum at actually on a Friday

299
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:05,160
there's been a lot of differences from

300
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,910
one Friday to the Friday so it's not

301
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:13,079
sufficient you know to to yesterday last

302
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:14,969
Friday was there are many people

303
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,520
floating go nuts

304
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:22,260
next Friday where should I go it's not

305
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,310
enough so what we do is we are running

306
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,610
out of time

307
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:28,680
what fish we do is apply the very same

308
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,800
pipeline as I show you previously we

309
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,260
collect a lot of data but about control

310
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,900
and enforcement so the calendar weather

311
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:41,340
information portal going to be stressed

312
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:43,709
like restaurants or stems well we have

313
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,440
all control data from from our customer

314
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:48,600
he gives us all the control he did like

315
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,250
with day due to location the car

316
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,470
controlled and was it a fraudster or not

317
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,330
we know the the parking infrastructure

318
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,000
of the city the juror occasions of all

319
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:01,620
parking spots and the number of them the

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,270
type of budget it's reserved for

321
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:10,059
disabled people for is it a regular spot

322
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:12,639
and we have all the street geometry of

323
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:14,980
and once we have collected all of this

324
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,620
data we train the machine learning

325
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:22,630
algorithms so the first part where the

326
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:24,879
algorithm calibrates under history and

327
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,010
when he has sufficiently trained we are

328
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,059
able to predict the number of violations

329
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:33,190
in the specific location and time and

330
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:34,990
once we collect some new data from day

331
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,870
to day we can really break periodically

332
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,760
to algorithms that he adapts to district

333
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:44,709
rival structural changes in the cities

334
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:48,220
and changes in behaviors and finally how

335
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:50,230
is it provided to the customer we

336
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,330
provide the dashboard for the managers

337
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,929
where there are recommendations and the

338
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,870
locations to visit and the periods main

339
00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:02,970
interests you can also compute some

340
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:06,250
operational priorities for example if

341
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,770
Adrian's need to walk a long street it

342
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:12,120
takes more time than it's the same

343
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:16,750
number of attractions in a short street

344
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,639
we we also address different types of

345
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,100
violations that can support a parking

346
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,919
but also reserved passion for disabled

347
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,139
people and so on we provide this also

348
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,970
kind of analytics for the manager to

349
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:32,740
better monitor his team and plan and all

350
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:37,090
of these predictions and recommendations

351
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:38,919
can also be forwarded to a agents on the

352
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,649
field in the streets through the our

353
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,890
mobile mobile application for example or

354
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,890
something

355
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,510
so just to show you in one minute how it

356
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,250
looks like for example for the manager

357
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,129
here's a map of the city here it's

358
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,260
Amsterdam with every street color from

359
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:01,460
yellow to red and depending on the

360
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:06,559
number of infractions the more already

361
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:11,260
the violations here you can also predict

362
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:15,950
walk tomorrow like one week in advance

363
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:20,030
you can also work with like sectors for

364
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:23,000
forest team patrolling example because

365
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:25,700
the street level is very precise it's

366
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,400
harder to to see to so he walks with

367
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:33,669
like sectors like hundreds of cyclists

368
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:36,410
to send cars and agents and on foot and

369
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:39,919
price I'm very in the particular sector

370
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,600
you can see how infraction we evolved so

371
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,880
for example it's more interesting in

372
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,719
sector to go by the end of the day where

373
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,690
people would start we stopped paying

374
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,049
because they think people new people

375
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:56,840
will come follow so this is how it looks

376
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:58,370
like basically so I am Jean with the

377
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,530
presentation and feel free if you have

378
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,530
any question to ask

379
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:11,839
[Applause]
