[Music]

2
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:38,320
basically what happens is

3
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:58,100
I know we don't have a lot of time

4
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:02,899
there's a lot of stuff that I want to

5
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:05,269
cover most of it is just demos so excuse

6
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:07,840
me for lack of interesting slides

7
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,840
they're not

8
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,059
[Music]

9
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,240
[Music]

10
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,099
we came back

11
00:02:46,910 --> 00:03:45,500
yeah it's a huge sure that was the one

12
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,540
place I tried everything

13
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,810
why am I telling you now there's a

14
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,980
reason the Reese means a lot of times in

15
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:59,220
research when we started off what Julian

16
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:03,780
analysts analysts who interested in

17
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:14,220
researching certain beats try but a lot

18
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:16,228
of times we don't know this story the

19
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,579
moral of the story is it just needs

20
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:28,729
someone to show you a little tiny bit go

21
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:28,729
that way follow that song

22
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:36,210
you're not stuck anymore that's very

23
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,240
important because when you're trying to

24
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,239
go into bondage Malibu you get stuck

25
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:46,159
trying to do this for the lost

26
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:03,340
well sure about six months later same

27
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:06,010
building same stuff exactly the same

28
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,679
thing happened right before pressing the

29
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:11,980
mother I think happens yes what they

30
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:17,050
sign these guys

31
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:20,680
roaming I mean that one bit that's all I

32
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,950
mean I'm gonna learn a new blueprint up

33
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:28,330
the building what the janitor will do

34
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:38,860
everything because that's his job I mean

35
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:44,380
I just need just one go find out now

36
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:49,530
before this turns into a cat talk let's

37
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:51,700
get into the presentation but quickly

38
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,000
like I told you the slides are pretty

39
00:05:51,700 --> 00:06:18,159


40
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:20,760
Manimal demos all flow the flow is

41
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,760
really

42
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:29,960
analysis trekking tell a lot of

43
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:33,700
buzzwords but a lot of time I come

44
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,700
across people who don't know the basics

45
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:55,990
how doesn't actually flow from point A

46
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:57,710
to point B quickly touch that I'm sorry

47
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:55,400
execution will tell you a little bit

48
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:59,150
about that all right super soon

49
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:02,469
so we need results we need a wandering

50
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,469
of three months of research

51
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:11,198
I'll say it's really possible housing

52
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:14,229
but where we should pass a negative

53
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,620
place pretty much everywhere depends

54
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:21,039
right depends on what you really are do

55
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,020
you want in a stock where you're looking

56
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,889
at dashboards and you know screens all

57
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,000
day oh that looks interesting

58
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,740
there you go reverse engineering team

59
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,640
well that was interesting

60
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:38,549
there you go response team no no that

61
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,549
looks interesting really fast

62
00:08:53,070 --> 00:09:03,279
definitely ours stock analysts research

63
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,980
people who are just dying out just so

64
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,939
they can actually get results just a

65
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:12,310
little bit we don't need the entire

66
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:16,690
turkeys on southern Alberta I would just

67
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:19,060
enough for them to be able to want show

68
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,670
results and to have just enough

69
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:30,459
interesting eats and pieces of research

70
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:36,959
so that they keep going on a lot of

71
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:36,959
times what happens is this is how

72
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,839
[Music]

73
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,980
to get results and show through the team

74
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:49,390
to other teams to the management the

75
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:54,630
leadership teams so that one they can

76
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,630
progress to actually

77
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:15,120
okay basic to me this is literally the

78
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:16,769
basics there are many more the internet

79
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,589
support man there's this tiny little

80
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:25,620
unknown site for github binary you're

81
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:29,720
just a quick look at the file a lot of

82
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:40,139
malware proper now enemies

83
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:43,199
honestly Windows portable executors by

84
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:46,910
material quickly look at it see what it

85
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:51,139
is grab just the basic information about

86
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:56,250
focus controller this is usually

87
00:11:51,139 --> 00:12:00,120
something that's long people don't use

88
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:02,790
it but it's in my opinion the most

89
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,839
important tools what if that's process

90
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:19,469
controller needs a tiny tiny program

91
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:21,959
that allows you to control lot of times

92
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:25,250
now we're in the queue two ways you

93
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,250
don't think it will

94
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,500
we control because if you try to control

95
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:34,110
the water the kitchen breaks down and we

96
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:49,170
want to execute this but we want to

97
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:51,690
execute it in control right so we

98
00:12:49,170 --> 00:13:17,250
actually control that's really important

99
00:12:51,690 --> 00:13:20,280
I'll show you process this is processed

100
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:24,890
water basically all the processes that

101
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:36,050
are running we can monitor them process

102
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:36,050
another to use that

103
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,150
dynamically from the processes that are

104
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:49,430
on our system

105
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:54,500
Mallory will see all of these tools in

106
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:57,620
action sack campaign for this is the one

107
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:01,930
that I was talking about earlier these

108
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:07,029
four stages are really any any malicious

109
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:09,829
in fact we've all seen that we may write

110
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:12,710
invoice bill whatever it is in France

111
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,860
now they write papers to do whatever

112
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:17,510
open the second see most of the times

113
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,020
it's just that sometimes it could be

114
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,020
something else

115
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:30,550
people still plug us B's from there

116
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,890
which is literally the stuff that you

117
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,070
[Music]

118
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,760
next time comes

119
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,539
[Music]

120
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:28,290
there is a lopsided it's just we don't

121
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:33,350
see that physics giving background which

122
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,349
is natural downloading process

123
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:50,780
successful your on your machine connects

124
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,780
back to the c2 and there's the guy

125
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:16,680
that's the campaign so it's really

126
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:24,800
important to understand understand we

127
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:24,800
need to put the box here which doesn't

128
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,540
people

129
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,249
[Music]

130
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:14,760
yes I managed to personally have her

131
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,099
glasses cause he won't deficit even yeah

132
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:22,530
there's multiple senses it's not just

133
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:24,480
one every sample with it many firstly

134
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:37,080
something was really Australia not even

135
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:38,910
that's English so yeah once you

136
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,490
understand the flow you can explain it

137
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,230
to people say women movie you see that

138
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:48,440
works

139
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:58,020
mr. email actually guy no mister

140
00:17:48,440 --> 00:18:03,150
endpoint protection well all of these if

141
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:06,110
you don't do that your if you was

142
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:12,750
Australian I said something really bad

143
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:15,320
since when classic Syrio Forel just say

144
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,320
you're your own

145
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:31,580
conferences in a very different way the

146
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:37,639
language is very well that's just died

147
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:48,090
just fish in this case example finish

148
00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:55,229
interesting that money wish VBS execute

149
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:58,639
a macro goes to the gates of Graham the

150
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:12,049
payroll on to your endpoint execution

151
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:12,049
see two stories over okay down ethics

152
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,980
[Music]

153
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:35,360
you should really block PowerShell

154
00:19:25,590 --> 00:20:07,889
reaching out okay well most people don't

155
00:19:35,360 --> 00:20:27,300
to be able to go out all right we'll

156
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:38,610
start off with the sound familiar right

157
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:41,780
so I'm skipping over so someone will

158
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,780
open it at some point in time

159
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,329
[Music]

160
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:49,840
trick-trick way of doing it without

161
00:21:47,679 --> 00:22:09,609
having to get into it the reason I do

162
00:21:49,840 --> 00:22:11,080
that is because so quickly do that I'll

163
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:13,470
quickly show you I want to go to my

164
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,470
children

165
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:29,890
there you go so that is lots of coal

166
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:33,590
right what is it

167
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,320
so this has been heavily out to scale it

168
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:38,110
said they written the code going through

169
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:48,350
a heavy

170
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:48,800
office care I'll show you how there's

171
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,790
more

172
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,550
it's heaps doesn't end what all of that

173
00:22:52,790 --> 00:23:01,460
stuff to run just a little tiny piece

174
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:06,700
approach now but triple B's is you

175
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,700
literally look for a function

176
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,550
that tells you what it does

177
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:23,899
you click it the macro runs it opens and

178
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,270
once you start executing more and more

179
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,360
it starts gathering all these bits

180
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:34,040
together it starts forming the little

181
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:38,030
command that is wrong in the back you

182
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:39,290
don't have a time to follow this but to

183
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:44,480
give you a bit of an idea

184
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:48,860
just stop start here and look beyond all

185
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,710
of this what you will see I'm guessing

186
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:57,139
you've all seen the infection game's

187
00:23:50,710 --> 00:24:01,400
detection game so it all looks really

188
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:04,310
hard because it's supposed to the

189
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:09,680
country once you start digging in it

190
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:12,940
will start making sense and it but it

191
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,940
but just like I'm not sure

192
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,350
ignore all of this stuff here

193
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:24,070
the next thing that you can actually

194
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:30,230
read okay

195
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:34,580
now two variables here write this and

196
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:36,380
this leave it to you guys but before I

197
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,500
just leave it I'll show you something

198
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,500
quickly

199
00:24:47,880 --> 00:25:00,600
there you go see yeah what I like doing

200
00:24:54,150 --> 00:25:08,360
is something really cool and you can

201
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:08,360
call it anything three plays

202
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,250
three please

203
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,940
three replacements well that's already I

204
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:29,100
know there's three occurrences of a

205
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:34,440
single variable there you go once you've

206
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:37,529
got all of that stuff done and you see

207
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:46,889
the whole picture now the fast and

208
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:48,840
tricky way we don't have time this

209
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:52,590
internal to the rescue one more time

210
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:58,789
right the far off this tool called sis

211
00:25:52,590 --> 00:26:02,369
mon sorry prop Mon process monitor

212
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:07,009
quickly setup filtering don't care about

213
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:07,009
the architecture process name

214
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,250
if the processor is PowerShell

215
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,720
and the operation

216
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,540
what a start

217
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:49,979
got it like okay

218
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:54,408
now hopefully it's down the trick now

219
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:58,289
we're gonna close this bit get back here

220
00:26:54,409 --> 00:27:00,539
for the purpose of this is this lab if

221
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:02,899
you look down there are disconnected

222
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,899
Internet

223
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,490
you know what

224
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:20,470
what

225
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:22,500
this is a fast and tricky right two

226
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:25,710
seconds you bought the entire thing

227
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,710
one there

228
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,248
it's really big

229
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,600
tasted him

230
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:50,369
yeah

231
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:57,738
that whole big that you seen with an

232
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:59,679
actual snow cone the only difference is

233
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:02,559
it has been encrypted

234
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:09,909
these guys are chilling on all the way

235
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:20,649
this is a 256 bit encryption top top : I

236
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:20,649
pick this one similar malware that just
