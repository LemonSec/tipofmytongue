1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:11,910
so I keep the bid which the menacing

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,309
tweet they're saying that I'm a Star

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,060
Trek person and the type of Star Wars

4
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:22,619
movie and I sort of promised Star Wars

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,840
puns which I won't deliver you know

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,830
that's making you a little surprised

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,230
however so yeah basically what I do is

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:34,649
people pay me to envision bad things

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,050
that would happen to them and to prevent

10
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,790
them and when they don't listen they

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:44,250
also pay me to you know pick up the

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:46,890
pieces so and also we are off well of

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:58,950
course I write things including

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:01:08,069
including this one and perhaps so yeah

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:11,310
talking about so why is it interesting

16
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:13,280
well because you know you get a lot of

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,829
things like this which is like your

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,459
toaster won't toast anything until it

19
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:23,369
gets its software update and then who

20
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,940
visit and then it will prove eventually

21
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,630
you know

22
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:30,960
your your slice bread and then you also

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,179
get things like months which are

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,740
installing software updates and you

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,380
cannot have your coffee until the

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,600
software updates okay

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:44,190
and then of course you get my favorite

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:49,229
sort of things which is a pizza order

29
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:54,800
but then added to with the very boudoir

30
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:57,900
invitation of get off and get stopped me

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,580
the time you get off the delivery guy

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:06,120
will come in the pizza so you get

33
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:09,478
stuffed very but where do so brings us

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:15,630
is to that sort of things so I do have

35
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:17,910
this I'm not using it security issues

36
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:21,890
with it however I was really really

37
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,890
attracted by it not because of the color

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:31,829
but because last year there was a

39
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,550
company producing a plugin which makes

40
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:43,470
it vibrate

41
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:47,459
according to market fluctuations I was

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:54,239
really looking forward to experiencing

43
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:57,660
you know however other people do and

44
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,340
it's where you know it's generally when

45
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:06,150
I talk about commitment

46
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:10,709
like aren't there any people - yes so

47
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:17,010
this is one use case we get come girls

48
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:20,519
or come boys using that sort of

49
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:24,298
connected to toys and here you have an

50
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:28,080
example of Congo chapter where a visitor

51
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:31,140
tips and gets temporary control over the

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,900
door because it connects on internet so

53
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,849
the more you tip the longer you control

54
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:42,290
it and the higher the vibrations you can

55
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:45,359
send and yeah for your information

56
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:49,140
ChatterBait only puts three cookies on

57
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,920
your on your sites on your internet

58
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:57,660
browser so you can say we go compared to

59
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,670
French la post it our which works 46 so

60
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:07,049
I would gladly stick to chat rebates

61
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:09,810
however it doesn't sell parcels - pretty

62
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:14,660
much this one but then you get things

63
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:18,690
which like this connected thermometer

64
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:24,330
through whose companion you can

65
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:26,910
basically lock fevers symptoms and

66
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,490
things like this so if your parents too

67
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,010
young that's that's good

68
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,310
the data is also sent to your doctor

69
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:38,639
which is also good and then there are

70
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,860
other companies commercializing really

71
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,889
health related things such as

72
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,270
and wipes which could basically get the

73
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:51,569
data from your thermometer and display

74
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:55,590
related apps into the advertisement

75
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:59,240
story into the companion app you know

76
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:04,109
and then you get that for a very

77
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:12,509
interesting story which is an old

78
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:14,250
thermometer and since the app also asks

79
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,539
access to the mic

80
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,009
your phone and to the multimedia content

81
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:20,870
you also get to have the sound in the

82
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:25,830
image

83
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:28,439
anyhow but then you know things are

84
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:34,139
pretty serious because we are talking

85
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:37,169
about people's sex lives and we are also

86
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:41,520
talking about what's starting to emerge

87
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:43,258
as a more society related problem where

88
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,430
you have harassment happening through

89
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:52,400
those objects right so this piece at the

90
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:56,759
New York Times this summer and we have

91
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,849
mostly women who after breaking up with

92
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:02,639
their abusive partners are experiencing

93
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:06,479
harassment two connected objects why

94
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,080
because society thinks males are the

95
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,680
geekiest once

96
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,960
this uninstalled the bill keeps the

97
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,729
control and when he leaves the

98
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,239
relationship well he keeps the control

99
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:24,080
gain and so many women come up with that

100
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,620
harassment stories of their thermostats

101
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:32,300
like kind rocketing temperature or you

102
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:35,389
know to the contrary unable to you to

103
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:43,580
unlock their door or lights going off

104
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:49,400
and on and and of course so for the

105
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:51,198
French in a person like this coming

106
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,539
along and saying look there is one

107
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,120
annoying precaution neighbor caps lock

108
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:59,870
by anything that connects to the

109
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,120
internet toys or otherwise because if it

110
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:06,259
connects the internet or we can access

111
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:10,330
it at a distance it is full of security

112
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:14,350
vulnerabilities and let alone if

113
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:17,200
probable mal abundance from the vendor

114
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,480
okay one an only precaution if you don't

115
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,930
want to be hit by a bus just you know

116
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,270
don't get out of home and you cannot

117
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,190
tell people don't buy anything just

118
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,650
because there is a security problem with

119
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:37,090
it

120
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:39,520
probably so so the thing is instead of

121
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:42,340
you know this place in responsibility

122
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,289
from the vendors and from us as a

123
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,119
professional community we are putting it

124
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,880
on the consumers and saying just don't

125
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,680
buy this okay so next time I decide I

126
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,290
don't want to be hit by a bus sighs I do

127
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,740
but I stay home

128
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:58,900
so that's fine of course I mean where

129
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,560
the person is right is that most of the

130
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:05,380
time security standards in connected

131
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,200
devices are like they're you know those

132
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:13,990
people still live in the 90s security

133
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:21,159
ways for different reasons right but we

134
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:23,040
can discuss much but what's the thing

135
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,360
that's mostly concerns us as

136
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,330
professionals is how do we study those

137
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,600
objects right because that's still a

138
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,240
mature industry there are a lot of

139
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,729
things just moving forward and evolving

140
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,500
as we speak like when I started being

141
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:41,250
interested in connected objects we were

142
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,889
having Bluetooth Low Energy versions

143
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:47,459
we have to worship or that was just a

144
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:50,670
mere year and a half ago so yeah there

145
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:57,869
are things evolving and the tools well

146
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:59,550
everyone comes up with stuff and so when

147
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:11,730
I'm telling you about difficulty to

148
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:14,579
having tools so this is the first time I

149
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:18,209
was doing research on connected sex toys

150
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:20,819
again so this one is from a male sex toy

151
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:24,810
so the idea is what you have a big thing

152
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:28,969
like this you will this female organ

153
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,969
like thing into it and it goes right

154
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:44,030
so the point is the thingy

155
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:46,520
connects bluetooth to your phone after

156
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:50,480
pairing happens you can control it with

157
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,910
the app which are of course through the

158
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,820
Wi-Fi connection the phone has caught

159
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:59,689
some distant servers whenever you are

160
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,460
lucky to an HTTP match and you know and

161
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:05,030
then you also can have third-party

162
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:07,840
services in this case there is a website

163
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:13,339
which brands itself is a go-to resource

164
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:16,970
about all things for example you could

165
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:20,570
have your favorite blowjob video in

166
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,510
there and some synchronizing the

167
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:26,390
movements of the baby or the guide us

168
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:29,750
with your sex toy I'm guessing people

169
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:32,990
like that from a security perspective

170
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:36,890
however we have all those things

171
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:41,410
happening right what's in your

172
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:45,590
connections we totally like different

173
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:50,480
protocols and applications and then you

174
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:53,480
get things like this safe sorry I did it

175
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,000
where you know I was curious that they

176
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,470
have a distant production server on the

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,720
same space and

178
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:04,080
with a self-signed certificate and then

179
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,880
when they compiled yeah it came out that

180
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,740
well they don't need a proper

181
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,060
certificate because everything goes to

182
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:17,370
in cleared things and of course I saw in

183
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:22,010
the network where just so my presumed

184
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:25,890
email address go through and I realize

185
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:29,490
from security to passwords that in the

186
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:33,140
five hash of my password and itself is

187
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,140
also used as an access token

188
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:43,880
so that story is that difficulties to

189
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:46,620
analyze an audit and and secure

190
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,290
connected devices come also from its

191
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,660
very nature because the connected device

192
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:55,160
is an ecosystem so you don't just look

193
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:58,560
at the device itself you also look at

194
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:01,500
the connection that's most often the

195
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,530
case it has to a smartphone which

196
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,390
generally is not protected or with a

197
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,230
very strong password such as one two

198
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:14,189
three four that she also find the FAQ

199
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:17,280
section of the website to most often the

200
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:20,130
companion app that sits on the web on

201
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,260
your smartphone about the cloud because

202
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,450
the companion app just talks to all I

203
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,460
don't know how many servers and the

204
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:31,950
internet connection over which it hopes

205
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:33,260
to the source so that's why

206
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:40,070
[Music]

207
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:43,490
into this we created you know to suit to

208
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:46,340
approach an address while at least

209
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,520
a big part of those issues of those

210
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,530
components of the ecosystem so we have

211
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,670
the PI rogue which is a Raspberry Pi

212
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:58,520
Kali Linux movie white device that

213
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:01,010
creates a dedicated network with which

214
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,350
you can basically collect whatever

215
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:06,350
traces you like because when you do it

216
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:10,510
through your test phone given that

217
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:15,320
vendors phones install thousands of apps

218
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:17,420
by default on them your traces are

219
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,310
generally polluted you have no idea

220
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,790
whether that Instagram connection was

221
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:27,310
actually the companion after studying or

222
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:30,290
after itself same for Facebook right

223
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:35,449
then we have once you have captured or

224
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:40,360
all the traces hi precious

225
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:40,360
so for instance

226
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:51,239
it's a great so so that we have this

227
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,769
platform where we store all the traces

228
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:58,899
with all the components of the psycho

229
00:13:53,769 --> 00:14:01,269
system and where every every we have

230
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:04,600
sessions that you can just replay as

231
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:06,970
they are and basically compare traces

232
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,569
between different setups in time and so

233
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:13,360
monitor so we just you know you can go

234
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:17,498
to no to the github we haven't updated

235
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:23,170
it in a while although if you so the

236
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:25,149
internal key Club it's it's pretty so as

237
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,649
I said you can also analyze specific

238
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:34,089
apps regardless of whether they're

239
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:38,429
connected to a sex toy or not so I

240
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:40,689
looked this material book due yesterday

241
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:42,759
because what I wanted to talk to you

242
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:48,699
about is application security rather

243
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:51,040
than IOT see guess most of you know this

244
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:54,790
app it tells you the weather forecasts

245
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,029
in below and if it does so for different

246
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,029
cities

247
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:07,590
and so that's the the welcome screen

248
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:11,310
you're greeted with as a compliance

249
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:16,550
person first thing I did is go to the

250
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:20,099
the privacy policy and it tells me that

251
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:22,229
optionally collects email address should

252
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,430
someone want to make a user account and

253
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:29,790
geolocation which is well sort of normal

254
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:32,640
because you know for it to provide a

255
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,910
city specific weather forecast where it

256
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:40,080
needs to know where you are but what it

257
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:42,569
actually requires as personal data is

258
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:47,700
not that early it's advertisement

259
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:51,920
account and then it said we don't use

260
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:55,140
any cookies to gather more information

261
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,010
concerning you and this is ghostery so

262
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:00,449
this is the tor browser right in which

263
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:03,090
ghostery installed which tells me that

264
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:07,730
well actually that's not true because

265
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:11,010
there are these five trackers about

266
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:13,230
specific advertisement

267
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,200
you know programmatically advertisements

268
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:20,610
and things like this so and we are here

269
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:22,980
on the privacy section and then what I

270
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:27,080
looked at is the permission slip asks

271
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:29,610
the app asks from your phone when

272
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,770
installations of course it asks for a

273
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:36,950
location which Google considers to be

274
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:41,730
dangerous what you don't understand is

275
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:44,790
why requires to work to be able to write

276
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,850
on external storage there is no

277
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:53,390
explanation whatsoever on that and this

278
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:59,400
is how my precious new faces up today

279
00:16:53,390 --> 00:17:02,660
which tells you up there the experiment

280
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,660
session you are

281
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:19,770
the cutable and there is no IOT device

282
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:24,209
associated because you're not testing an

283
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:28,109
IOT device and basically we apply

284
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:32,990
different different rules so for malware

285
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:37,949
researchers here you know if ya which is

286
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:40,409
an open source for detecting different

287
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:44,130
signatures so we basically since it's

288
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:46,409
open source we transformed it into a

289
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,370
tool to detect different types of

290
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:52,049
information that are consumed by

291
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:55,678
different distant servers and other apps

292
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:58,020
on the phone when focusing on one given

293
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,419
application so here what we have is that

294
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,418
okay you have crushing this

295
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,810
like application handle that's pretty

296
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,939
normal

297
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,919
crashlytics gives you analytics about

298
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,350
the performance of your application so

299
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:18,480
it needs to know how what the app is

300
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:24,969
what's it's Russian internet and we also

301
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:29,110
we are tracking whether it's over HTTPS

302
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,850
or not and and where things get funny

303
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,280
while depending on your sense of humor

304
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,780
is when you realize that your

305
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,350
geolocation which is considered the

306
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:43,290
rather sensitive information person is

307
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:47,290
sent over HTTP

308
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:53,080
we didn't dig further to see how open it

309
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:57,370
descent you know I would go kinetics

310
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,210
here generally up to in in a toilet

311
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:03,659
nested

312
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:06,100
we were up to six times per second so

313
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:10,240
you know it's pretty often because the

314
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:15,270
promise the service promises to give you

315
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:18,100
information as often as necessary and

316
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:19,870
necessary can be like up to six four

317
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:24,340
eight times a second

318
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:26,560
very necessary so of course we do blame

319
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:33,280
developers breakfast there they're the

320
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:37,540
main people right and we're older person

321
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:40,420
like me some may know that the

322
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:45,730
developers developers developers told by

323
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:50,830
former Microsoft big person Steve

324
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:53,650
Ballmer if I remember correctly right so

325
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:56,010
because developers are to blame let's

326
00:19:53,650 --> 00:20:03,070
see what they are doing wrong well

327
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:06,010
people say less aware with application

328
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:10,050
development this is more or less how an

329
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:13,000
app is built you have the source code

330
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:20,290
most open in Java but you can also have

331
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:22,540
it is the JavaScript and so on if it's

332
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:24,700
Java it's generally compiled so we have

333
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,340
most the jar files and then you have

334
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:30,160
different assets and what people add a

335
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,870
lot is indicates that's sort of a

336
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,520
library

337
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,820
anyone can use it it just I need a

338
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:39,190
button I just put a music doesn't button

339
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:42,510
that's it which means that I have

340
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,510
something that does

341
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,760
. someone is taking care of it because

342
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,439
I'm not you know brain inventing the

343
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,500
wheel every time I'm just taking what

344
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,370
exists however where things get messy is

345
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:01,730
that if you don't have SDKs specific

346
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:05,800
such as Facebook or other advertisements

347
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,800
related in the case you cannot monetize

348
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:21,710
so this is yeah an idea of what

349
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:33,800
advertisement providers get the lion's

350
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:42,260
share then you have Facebook and they're

351
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:44,480
in between flurry which is now so those

352
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:49,310
are all anything that you can find in

353
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:53,840
applications and the people putting this

354
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:57,240
forward are an NGO French NGO that so

355
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,669
does privacy which some of you may have

356
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:05,700
and for example for the medieval condo

357
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:10,390
application exhibit science 14

358
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:12,580
advertisement trackers right so we

359
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,890
looked at macro ties which is very

360
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:20,500
famous in France which you find a whole

361
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:23,800
range of different different apps and oh

362
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:28,270
yeah sorry yeah I was just about to tell

363
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:31,720
that you have a lot of SDKs including

364
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:34,210
malicious ones because since anyone can

365
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,480
use them well again anyone can use them

366
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:40,810
including malicious actors and for

367
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:43,870
example this interesting thing is the

368
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:49,899
equivalent of Google as in China and I

369
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:53,080
found it into seemingly American sector

370
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:57,010
away and health toweling and basically

371
00:22:53,080 --> 00:23:04,480
mimics the whole Google ecosystem with

372
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:12,610
send stuff to China and so basically

373
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:15,550
what is it something basically you use

374
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:18,969
this 8 hour thing when you do Java

375
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:22,149
applications for two things either when

376
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:27,910
you have multiple Android apps but you

377
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:31,030
want them to share common features or in

378
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:35,380
the other situation I have for example a

379
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:38,050
free app and to have you know the same

380
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:41,260
common features so I will use those

381
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:43,889
things so what we did is we we have a

382
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,890
small tool

383
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:51,190
those is the case and we monetize and

384
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:55,210
what we did is first we determined which

385
00:23:51,190 --> 00:24:00,160
methods call sensitive Android functions

386
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:04,680
from that advertisement okay then we

387
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:10,570
looked at the permissions that it needs

388
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:13,210
and then the the URLs that are inscribed

389
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:15,929
into it that means which are the distant

390
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:24,220
servers it connected and for example for

391
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:27,610
an advertisement SDK it asks you or this

392
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:31,750
Wi-Fi state and if you have access Wi-Fi

393
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:36,010
state you can also Joe Gator that's

394
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:40,320
quite straightforward and also it

395
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:44,950
connects to different distance servers

396
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:48,120
that are related to apps not a surprise

397
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:52,450
what it does there how what does it send

398
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:55,330
we're still digging so that's the sort

399
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:57,550
of things you can help with as the case

400
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,409
and then when we talk about this when we

401
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:04,629
talk about connecting these two distant

402
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:08,740
servers we also talked about ApS and to

403
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:14,800
my knowledge this company is the only

404
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:19,020
that sex toy company that has CBS you

405
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,020
know reported with the critical impact

406
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:26,799
they don't eat the count so what and

407
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:31,020
they're the problem was specifically

408
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:34,480
with the API so in an afternoon we could

409
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:36,730
confirm that you can register with the

410
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,159
fake email that means create a fake

411
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,570
account and there will be no

412
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:43,289
verification that you're an actual

413
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:46,059
person that the email actually exists

414
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:49,990
once you have this you can just you have

415
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:52,750
a you have an account and then without

416
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:56,289
even having the app or anything just for

417
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:58,779
the API we could mobilize this quick

418
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:01,360
control function that allows you to send

419
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:03,399
vibes you know over the Internet to some

420
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,500
people and you can basically do

421
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:09,699
absolutely any user you just type you

422
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:13,539
know ID number like from them and if the

423
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:16,600
user exists well it sends them invites

424
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:22,059
you know even this user public profiles

425
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:24,789
like again by typing into IDs and also

426
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:28,240
see any profile even if it's private and

427
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:32,950
so we could geo locate like around a few

428
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,929
hundreds of people in France just API

429
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,200
who have declared themselves as being

430
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:43,539
transsexual and using the toy at that

431
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:46,149
moment and I just picked five ideate

432
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:48,760
from them and you know google them which

433
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:52,500
is that's very advanced research and I

434
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,500
was able to identify

435
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:59,580
you know I just shut down holding it

436
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:02,158
nothing anymore so and yeah those people

437
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,928
actually we are not sure we haven't

438
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,929
looked at it anymore but we are not sure

439
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:14,940
however when the TV report came up

440
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:18,860
people would consider that all the data

441
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:24,110
was available on the internet for reps

442
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,110
so yeah developers developers developers

443
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:30,360
so where I'm going with all this other

444
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:35,490
than scare you off of buying connected

445
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:37,799
devices is that we need really to what

446
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:44,879
are you doing but also how you're doing

447
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:45,658
things because to my knowledge correct

448
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:48,750
me if I'm wrong

449
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:51,120
there is no automating like automation

450
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:55,980
to helping you to analyze and secure an

451
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:59,610
API when you do dynamic analysis meaning

452
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:02,759
you decompile apps or SDKs that's

453
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:05,000
illegal in Europe you can also you can

454
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:09,149
only do it for interoperability purposes

455
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,230
so what I'm telling you here is not very

456
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:16,110
legal right like things I have done are

457
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:18,280
not great right we just put permission

458
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:22,219
we have

459
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:26,980
you know so we're finding ways of not

460
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,980
doing this like using empty
