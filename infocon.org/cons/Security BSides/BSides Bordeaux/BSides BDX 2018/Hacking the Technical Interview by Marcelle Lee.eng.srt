1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:42,030
embarrassment to my son so new but it's

2
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,700
really interesting company we do ad

3
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,280
fraud detection like tracking down

4
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,309
botnets that are stealing money through

5
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,039
advertising basically so pretty cool

6
00:00:50,309 --> 00:01:12,479
space I might mention more than once

7
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:14,729
that work hard this is the cool thing

8
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,759
about the company they open offices

9
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:24,869
where the people are so we have so right

10
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,939
now we are based in New York City London

11
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,340
which is basically three guys from

12
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,798
Google

13
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:35,659
our forest we have an office in Buenos

14
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,520
Aires and an office in Victoria so

15
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,229
really it is where people are so I'm

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:48,380
pretty sure we could put together some

17
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:49,939
kind of French office I also have my own

18
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,280
consulting company in fact a security

19
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:54,258
group and I'm a professor at a few

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,369
different universities back in the

21
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:58,219
States which is where I'm from

22
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:04,429
obviously I live in Maryland which is

23
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:06,860
near Washington DC I am a

24
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:14,980
self-proclaimed not just self-proclaimed

25
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:17,150
pretty well I love following phishing

26
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,488
tracking it down from that initial

27
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,890
malicious link or document that we heard

28
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:25,900
about earlier all the way through to the

29
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:31,190
ultimate like sunny whatever bad things

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:34,519
and I've had so many I've also given

31
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,290
quite a few as well so so that's why I

32
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,049
dreamed up this talk and I actually gave

33
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,298
a variation of this talking comm this

34
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:43,819
year so this is a little bit of a reboot

35
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:46,639
I had with some things about France and

36
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:52,790
whatnot but yeah so starting to

37
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:55,010
celebrate be interesting to share I'm

38
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:58,599
not gonna Jefferson I'm not an attorney

39
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,599
Oh hrs Human Resources

40
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:17,640
yeah recently you all I just happened to

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:20,480
do other stuff so my obligatory need

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:28,890
from matrix of course you must have that

43
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:30,780
so who here anybody here interested in

44
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:36,630
possibly having another job at some

45
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:40,350
point in time yeah brighter on the

46
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:42,269
horizon so all right so what we're gonna

47
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,210
do is kind of good in some different

48
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:47,430
steps on the dollar G I'm trying to go

49
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,950
about finding a better job or a

50
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,210
different job or or whatever so the

51
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,510
first part of that this really is

52
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:57,660
defining but what you want in a job and

53
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,579
I did a lot of people mentoring to do so

54
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,220
that's kind of you know I talked a lot

55
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,410
of people about their job searches

56
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:07,709
people don't sitting to themselves what

57
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:10,290
to buy what in a job there is like this

58
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:12,420
company or or whatever there's some

59
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:18,779
reason to maybe but not necessarily it's

60
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:20,279
kind of a blind pursuit at times so I

61
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:23,460
just put like a little sort of word

62
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:27,020
cloud of different things that you could

63
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,020
want in a job right

64
00:04:48,900 --> 00:05:01,690
and then you also want to think about

65
00:04:51,970 --> 00:05:03,729
where Google that's definitely one kind

66
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:20,020
of vibe does anybody have you ever been

67
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:21,940
to everywhere you might want to work in

68
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,560
that space the government you know in

69
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,219
defense side of things that's also a

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:35,370
possibility

71
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:35,370
Oh does anybody know this lower images

72
00:05:50,580 --> 00:06:14,919
so what you actually want to do and this

73
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,110
is more for people who are just getting

74
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,150
started out in the field but I hear a

75
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,490
lot of people say that they want to do

76
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,310
cybersecurity anything that you want to

77
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,740
do cybersecurity it's let's say I want

78
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,229
to do medicine and and what does that

79
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,080
make you want to be a doctor a brain

80
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:33,370
surgeon do you want to be like an x-ray

81
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,580
tech it could be so many different

82
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,229
things and cyber is the same way so try

83
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:46,029
to figure out what your paths which

84
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:53,500
reaches is super important to the work

85
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:55,060
force framework is anybody so-oh to show

86
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,680
you right now because it's a really

87
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,800
useful website perfect people who are

88
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,399
credit figuring things out and I

89
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,599
conveniently have a cabinet of course so

90
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,639
so this was something that was developed

91
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:08,139
by NIST which is the National Institute

92
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,360
for Standards and Technology in the

93
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:12,639
States with all these regulations for

94
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,169
how to secure things and whatnot but

95
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,699
they came up with this sort of like like

96
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:24,758
a category they should have all these

97
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:27,370
different job areas and it's a really

98
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,740
useful place to start if you're just not

99
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:32,469
quite sure what you want to do right so

100
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,550
so like one of the areas is analyzed and

101
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:37,639
then there's different kinds of

102
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:40,310
within here and then collect and operate

103
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,039
so in a set forth but it goes right down

104
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,690
into like what are the skills and

105
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,729
knowledge that you need for like each of

106
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:50,770
these types of positions so it's super

107
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:53,750
useful for exploration I would say and

108
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,539
also at least in the states we're seeing

109
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,909
more and more adoption from the side of

110
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:00,740
companies in terms of using these

111
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:17,169
categories when they're trying to hire

112
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:17,169
people so the security engineer and

113
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,550
different things so consistency in that

114
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:29,630
areas is definitely a struggle for us so

115
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,250
next step for the process now that

116
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,020
you've figured out what you want maybe

117
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,820
where you want to work or at least sort

118
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,419
of where you would it work need to

119
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,649
understand the players so this should be

120
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:45,680
pretty familiar most this is basically

121
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:49,850
the interview or the crudity process so

122
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:53,149
you send your resume or CV off to some

123
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,100
website right and the first person annex

124
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:58,279
a person loosely who's going to read

125
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:02,620
your resume is about right it's going to

126
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:04,790
get your resume looking for keywords and

127
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,410
there's a little trick to this to about

128
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,750
making sure you

129
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,199
with the keywords that but if you don't

130
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,200
if you don't

131
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,170
are you a fit for this job you'll never

132
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,610
get past first step so meeting the bots

133
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,020
is really like the first thing you have

134
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:25,970
to do and then you're gonna get

135
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,860
contacted by the actual recruiter so the

136
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:50,630
recruiter is not it's going to be a

137
00:09:27,860 --> 00:10:15,920
technical person at least any idea what

138
00:09:50,630 --> 00:10:18,320
the answers are the sort of final team

139
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,979
interview which is typically a panel

140
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,850
interview

141
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:24,850
is anybody here there's so much fun

142
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:39,709
have you by phone what you can't tell

143
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,709
who you're talking to

144
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,110
so these are just things to sort of

145
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:51,599
mentally prepare yourself for because if

146
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:55,170
you don't you're gonna get me hung up in

147
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,139
some of the stats and yeah so it's

148
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,779
important and if you have questions by

149
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:04,350
the way or comments feel free to jump in

150
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,730
I tend to be kind of interactive so if

151
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:13,980
you don't ask me questions I'll ask you

152
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:15,329
questions yeah hear that all the time if

153
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,550
you're not familiar with this technique

154
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:19,680
you take like all the keywords from the

155
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:39,719
job postings and sprinkle them out

156
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:42,120
through your resume just using like what

157
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,189
I do recommend is there's a couple of

158
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,519
websites out there I'm sure more than a

159
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:47,459
couple

160
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,380
but websites that will do you know the

161
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:52,290
the tag clouds where you see you take

162
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,360
the resume or the job posting dump it

163
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,459
into this website it'll give me the word

164
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,350
we could see right so you'll see it says

165
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:59,339
cyber sergeant sugar a million times and

166
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:12,300
then

167
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:51,510
whatever else all right oh yeah

168
00:12:12,300 --> 00:13:09,060
ask questions accordingly so in this

169
00:12:51,510 --> 00:13:10,980
we've been really important to do this

170
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,420
sort of thing but you know I mean

171
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,910
everybody in this field is kind of a

172
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:20,670
researcher like I'm really good at mean

173
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:24,480
I think for sure find out lots of stuff

174
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:33,959
before you do anything which leads me to

175
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:39,060
this so recon or reconnaissance in this

176
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:42,990
process so do your homework so research

177
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:51,349
the company quite upset dear did I

178
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:51,350
mention that we're from France

179
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,360
[Music]

180
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,180
I'm gonna find out as much as I possibly

181
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,730
can about them this is just like a

182
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,319
starting point right but clearly the

183
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,750
website it's going to be your number one

184
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,350
go-to source for for information about

185
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:12,890
that organization I look at things like

186
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:14,420
certainly there wouldn't be writing

187
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:24,319
about what are they working on what's

188
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:26,660
what's interesting to them all these

189
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,800
things are clues for you to the kinds of

190
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:33,680
things to focus on in your interview so

191
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,050
like so knowing what they do about like

192
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,120
botnets and whatnot for me doing an

193
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,550
interview there or many interviews there

194
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:48,050
actually and you can you know I can a

195
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:50,120
lot of the technical skills that came so

196
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,609
I think it's not an activity that I hear

197
00:14:50,120 --> 00:15:01,060
from different like campaigns and things

198
00:14:52,610 --> 00:15:03,350
like what that totally worked there and

199
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,500
then don't forget about the part where

200
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,020
they're going to Google you right so

201
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,270
those employees are going to see what

202
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,280
they can find about you or even if it's

203
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,740
not the recruiter doing it although the

204
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:19,370
recruiter will the people who are going

205
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,580
to interview you and see do you have a

206
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,640
Twitter

207
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:26,110
lieutenant you yeah please don't use

208
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,790
Facebook for work stuff that's just

209
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:36,730
awful I don't know his Facebook anything

210
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:38,439
here it's yeah go right in that

211
00:15:36,730 --> 00:16:04,019
universities or schools should get

212
00:15:38,440 --> 00:16:04,019
people being shown yes five is for you

213
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,409
[Music]

214
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:25,779
so I'm Angelique save yourself if you're

215
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,779
trying to like sort of develop certain

216
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:30,850
areas like you have a github page are

217
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:34,410
you on Stack Exchange things like that

218
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:37,570
you know sometimes you want it like

219
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:41,439
helpful for you in your job thing this

220
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:44,170
like I recommend against having a

221
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,500
profile on LinkedIn that looks like this

222
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:51,910
which is basically nothing just a very

223
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:54,220
general sort of description because and

224
00:16:51,910 --> 00:17:13,990
I know this from recruiters that told me

225
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:17,079
so if you have like so it's now we've

226
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:25,599
gotten through all this with sort of

227
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:27,909
like next okay so a couple kinds of

228
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:31,800
interviewing right these days there's a

229
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:33,820
lot of remote interviewing I've had

230
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:49,510
interviews like sitting in the parking

231
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:51,309
lot in my car but even if you are in

232
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,290
your car whenever you want to try to

233
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:55,960
make that a background as conducive as

234
00:17:53,290 --> 00:18:02,889
possible to sounding professional so the

235
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:05,470
dogs barking babies crying you know we

236
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,240
can dress the part I mean chances are

237
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,130
maybe it's a subscribe interview and

238
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,270
they'll see you from here up maybe just

239
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,270
wear pants anyway

240
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:26,090
something different in England but cows

241
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:29,030
or whatever yeah so and then if you're

242
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,549
doing an in-person interview which my

243
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,899
spirits like most of the interviews you

244
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:35,168
know they started out with a remote

245
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,610
thing of put call or Skype or whatever

246
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:41,710
but it's a point in time you're probably

247
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:44,149
going to have an in-person interview and

248
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,740
one of the things that I think it's

249
00:18:44,150 --> 00:19:12,190
super important especially in our

250
00:18:45,740 --> 00:19:16,309
industry is dressing up in a suit and

251
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:18,140
everybody's wearing like jeans and tee

252
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:20,178
shot t-shirts and this is another place

253
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,450
where it's okay to ask the question you

254
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:25,039
know saying what should I wear

255
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,720
and I used to think you couldn't go

256
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,870
wrong with wearing a suit but I've

257
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,230
changed my mind about that yeah

258
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:36,209
sometimes

259
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:39,570
like stuff a year and you can tell the

260
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:51,210
story Department - but like if I was

261
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:55,340
going for a job at the Pentagon but yeah

262
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,340
so it's just things to think about here

263
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,939
[Music]

264
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,269
okay there's some other things to think

265
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,710
about

266
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,710
oh yeah don't be late

267
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:19,990
your interview before you even start

268
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:21,809
this but try to avoid it and this is

269
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,440
gonna be somebody who's like always late

270
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:27,460
um making eye contact that you'd say

271
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,640
Kathy you are also supposed to make I

272
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:35,710
can't contact when you do cheers here my

273
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:45,190
son has told me it's a lot of practice

274
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:49,059
seriously and I actually do it unlike a

275
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:52,710
note pad and paper because I don't want

276
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:52,710
the person to think I'm really just like

277
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:21,830
anyway and then taking breaks so the tea

278
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,049
breaks things sounds weird

279
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,340
interviews can be really long or you're

280
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:28,309
just meeting with like a series of

281
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,529
people so I have actually interviewed

282
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:37,700
for stories which are lived here in

283
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:44,659
interview company that makes it

284
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:55,669
extremely well and they told me coming

285
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:58,429
in expect to be there for six hours okay

286
00:22:55,669 --> 00:23:07,129
because theoretically he would have been

287
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:09,289
there long enough to so anyway so I'm

288
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:10,668
there I ordered my lunch I feel like

289
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:20,590
everybody was looking to see what I

290
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:23,419
ordered because anyway so so it was

291
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:26,658
started out as a panel interview with

292
00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:29,149
several people and then it went to like

293
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:34,460
a one-on-one with each of these people

294
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:36,649
individually and mostly what I was doing

295
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,409
or being asked to do was and this might

296
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:41,479
be a clue as to the company was I was

297
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:43,970
asked to write snort rules for various

298
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,960
things on a whiteboard in front of

299
00:23:43,970 --> 00:24:02,929
people just off the top of my head so I

300
00:23:47,960 --> 00:24:04,730
did this for a while so anyway so I made

301
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:07,210
it poured a half hours and then did back

302
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,210
in the job

303
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,900
unpleasant experience but the funny

304
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,700
thing is like couple years later they

305
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,289
use that to me introduce me for the

306
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,450
position and so I went through all the

307
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:18,100
preliminary steps and whatnot and then

308
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:33,640
there's a quite we'd like you to come in

309
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:35,830
for an interview it's going to be okay

310
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:52,780
so yeah so take a break in that case for

311
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:54,549
sure yeah do not kiss like the person

312
00:24:52,780 --> 00:25:26,820
you're interviewing because you kiss

313
00:24:54,549 --> 00:25:26,820
each other a lot right so all right

314
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,420
to that there's no reason that you

315
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:46,980
cannot come up with answers for all

316
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:50,160
these things because they're standard

317
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:51,660
questions right um how do you stay

318
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,520
current in the industry

319
00:25:51,660 --> 00:26:01,620
somebody tell me how they stay current

320
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:09,990
in the industry come here yes good cards

321
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:13,040
absolutely blogs yes absolutely podcast

322
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:19,590
I'm a huge podcast person love that

323
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:31,530
saying up so because they're not party

324
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:33,659
but don't worry law so other things why

325
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:41,070
are you leaving your current position

326
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:44,370
never biggest we did its biggest

327
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:45,870
strength that's so hard right so my my

328
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,610
goal is to spin the weakness so it

329
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,229
sounds like a good thing and make the

330
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,570
string sound awesome without sounding

331
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:55,370
like I'm totally ready it takes a little

332
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,370
practice you have to think about it

333
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:13,610
I understand that this is you know

334
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:22,110
putting people off you know strong I

335
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:23,939
love that I love that sometimes I say

336
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,709
negative it's like I'm really bad at

337
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,290
delegating because I really just want to

338
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:32,190
make sure that you know everything's

339
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:34,560
perfect more or less similar yeah I'm

340
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:42,240
not gonna be too often I keep leaving my

341
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:45,690
pants off every time I've been asked

342
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,550
many many times in an interview and like

343
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:50,370
I said it can be tricky like what you

344
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:54,060
say in response to this can totally like

345
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:56,070
bias the person interviewing you so in

346
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,780
our field you know saying you're

347
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,700
building your home lab that gets

348
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:02,930
everybody excited right and if you don't

349
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,930
have a good lab you should have

350
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:13,940
I'm studying for you know certification

351
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:16,820
whatever volunteering for Camp security

352
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,580
crosses these all actually forgetting

353
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:23,090
that I have them aligned with each other

354
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:25,220
there's nothing any time with my kids

355
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:27,110
nothing wrong with spending time with

356
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:32,720
your kids just revealed some personal

357
00:28:27,110 --> 00:30:53,480
information about volunteering at church

358
00:28:32,720 --> 00:30:55,779
again this is everybody all right so

359
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,210
technical questions

360
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:59,409
so this is harder when you're going on

361
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,090
technical interviews right because

362
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:03,309
there's so many things that they could

363
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:05,590
ask you and it's really hard to prepare

364
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:09,190
but the other part easy-peasy to prepare

365
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:11,259
but godness so these are examples of

366
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:14,950
questions that I have gotten multiple

367
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:19,149
times in fact okay so a funny story

368
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:28,179
about TCP three-way handshake who knows

369
00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:29,979
what TCP 4u 8 I had one interview after

370
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:38,889
series of many sort of like back to back

371
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:40,990
and they did not and then it never did

372
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:44,879
so at the end of the interview when they

373
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,879
asked me you have any questions

374
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:52,070
[Laughter]

375
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:07,629
they're not just examples they're ones

376
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:09,429
that I have there's even one page seems

377
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:13,840
like kind of simple things but it

378
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:17,309
couldn't throw you off I'm trying to

379
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,309
cover a broad range of topics

380
00:32:53,830 --> 00:33:03,770
and when you're facing somebody even on

381
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:05,179
the phone you can tell us a lot and they

382
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,740
start asking this question and I'm like

383
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:08,390
what exactly do you want to know right

384
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,919
menace to me and I'm gonna keep on them

385
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,840
as well so it's it's a back-and-forth of

386
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,159
questions but when the interviewer tells

387
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,139
you have written yeah but basically when

388
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,580
the interviewer themselves you know just

389
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,630
tell me what you want when you want to

390
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,428
talk about yeah

391
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,320
it's like I don't find that I don't find

392
00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:26,750
that answer because if you're actually

393
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,090
trying to hire somebody in like a

394
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,860
consulting type role you want that

395
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,779
person to be asking questions be

396
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,699
evolving with their discussion so you

397
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:35,960
get to the precision and when you have

398
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,730
an interviewer that's basically just

399
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,080
coming you know just describe to me what

400
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,090
happens just to try to think what

401
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,549
happens you're not engaging in

402
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:50,510
discussion no I know you also wonder if

403
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:52,760
they have any idea I can go from the

404
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,379
point where the stupid application

405
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,080
developer doesn't have you know

406
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,730
basically starts DNS query meeting every

407
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,529
time you type of level just waste of

408
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:03,980
time yeah all the way down to how do you

409
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:08,119
build a tcp/ip stack I mean depending on

410
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:11,379
the OS gonna change and this is where

411
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,379
you could have to let the interviewer

412
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:18,919
and I'll start going into like this long

413
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,960
we did explanation of how things work

414
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:23,149
and then another stage for their eyes

415
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:41,589
are pleasing to the port or not and you

416
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:41,589
know strong suspicion when they're in

417
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:58,850
so how does
