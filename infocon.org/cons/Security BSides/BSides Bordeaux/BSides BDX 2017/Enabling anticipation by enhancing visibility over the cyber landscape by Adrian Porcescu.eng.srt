1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:08,309
hello everyone I've met most of you

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,379
already so my name is Adria fortescu

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,448
I'm a pre sales consultant for Cody's

4
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:14,430
future and a cyber security professional

5
00:00:12,449 --> 00:00:17,550
for 10 years now

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:21,390
and today I'm going to talk about

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,610
enabling anticipation by enhancing your

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,080
visibility over the cyber landscape so

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,520
it's basically understanding how you can

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,380
anticipate what's going to happen to

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,230
your business what are the capabilities

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,910
of threats against your business by

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,730
obtaining or disability over the

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,890
landscape that what happens in donetsk

15
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:44,339
so first of all I will start with some

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,290
conceptual ideas the concept behind the

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,829
use cases that I would use a bit later

18
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,300
on

19
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:54,480
so we over here cyber security

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,790
specialists right and our duty is to

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,648
solve security problems right

22
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,629
unfortunately and I've had this t-shirt

23
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,660
on the honest with you I haven't brought

24
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,630
it with me we usually are told to be

25
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,520
solving problems that the company

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,249
doesn't know about with methods that

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,289
nobody understands which I totally

28
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:15,929
disagree because we should never be

29
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:19,079
acting on tests and solving cyber

30
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:22,350
security problems is about defining and

31
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,329
achieving objectives on different levels

32
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,399
that are related to the business right

33
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:28,469
so it should be on a strategical level

34
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:29,999
like for example I need to identify the

35
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:32,130
threats that might impact or could

36
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:34,770
impact my business it might be on a

37
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,719
technical level enforce an aggressive

38
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,630
risk-based I don't know who nobility

39
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:41,848
patching system and also an operational

40
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,589
level like ensure that the users are not

41
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:45,029
leaking credentials or if they did what

42
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,639
happened with those and so on

43
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:49,109
so understanding all of these and

44
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:50,699
understanding that basically we need to

45
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:54,749
solve troubles that are related to the

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,549
business we transform this into being

47
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:59,219
the cyber security specialist that

48
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,889
actually solves problems that you as a

49
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,499
business knew about because it started

50
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:06,839
from there right and with the methods

51
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:08,788
that you should be understanding we

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,130
should be able as security specialists

53
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,350
or Italy all of these two different

54
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,850
departments in the business right

55
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,760
because all of the problems are actually

56
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:22,829
their problems we need to solve

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,049
okay so what are the actual usual mix of

58
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,810
things that end up helping us solving

59
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,820
problems in security and we all know

60
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,010
that it's a lot of mix of people

61
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,630
processes and technologies and you all

62
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,340
know the saying that if you think

63
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,400
technology will be solving your security

64
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,620
problems even on technology Lenovo

65
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,630
security right so it's a mix of all of

66
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,090
these we need people we need

67
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,710
technologies and we processes to run

68
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,290
those technologies properly when it

69
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:52,020
processes that are matching the business

70
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,609
the way the business runs right and all

71
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,310
of this and I think you can all agree

72
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,500
with me start getting enhancements once

73
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,230
they get visibility and for example

74
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,870
technology and antimatter if you take it

75
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,579
it gives it more effective if it gets

76
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,780
visibility on the system to be able to

77
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,880
understand what's happening on the

78
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,680
system and it also gets visibility on

79
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,810
the threats it has more signatures so

80
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,670
it's more powerful right it's enhanced

81
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,380
the same with the scene if you're

82
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,230
bringing logs from different places and

83
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,299
you have visibility you get to enhance

84
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:23,850
your your systems it's the same for

85
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,010
processes no process will ever be

86
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,600
efficient if it doesn't have visibility

87
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,609
in the things that is actually managing

88
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,560
as a process right and the same with

89
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,930
people of course we need basically have

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,910
good decisions and every day we are

91
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,590
making a lot of decisions I think is

92
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,410
like 13,000 decisions that we're making

93
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,690
every day and all of those are enhanced

94
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,000
I mean decisions like from taking one

95
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,450
step right and all of these are being

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,160
enhanced once we get visibility but what

97
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,829
is actually visibility about and

98
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,290
visibility is about getting access to

99
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:59,340
data information because that's what

100
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,880
brings visibility and all of these three

101
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,950
like people processes and technology

102
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,160
have advantages and disadvantages and

103
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,739
the fact that they are working together

104
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,710
that's the reason why they end up being

105
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,600
the thing that actually helps us solving

106
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:18,150
problems because for example technology

107
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,909
can be faster than humans right

108
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:22,710
but there are some humans that are not

109
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,080
replaceable because they know so much

110
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,010
about the business the technology cannot

111
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,330
replace them right also processes there

112
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,219
are a lot of processes

113
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,349
and a lot of methodologies that are

114
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,960
being developed to slow security

115
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:39,180
problems but the thing is there is no

116
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,638
one that fits everything so we need

117
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,770
people that understand the business in

118
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,740
order to define the proper processes and

119
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,840
to choose the right methodologies that

120
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,539
are suited for the business right so

121
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,698
unless we have a mix of these three we

122
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:57,120
will never be able to solve efficiently

123
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:59,250
problems and to enhance all of these of

124
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,550
course we need to bring date on top of

125
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:05,969
it but data also have advantages and

126
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,819
disadvantages it is available internally

127
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:11,759
externally there is a lot of data right

128
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,979
storage is very cheap so we can store it

129
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,300
once we prep it but it has the

130
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:20,128
disadvantage that is hard to collect

131
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,949
right because it's a lot of it so it's

132
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:26,490
quite hard to collect and also it's hard

133
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:28,259
to organize or to understand because as

134
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,939
I think most of you have worked with a

135
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,439
scheme before right you need to

136
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,719
interpret those logs you need to

137
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,279
normalize them you need to bring them at

138
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:37,710
the same level in order for the

139
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:41,849
technology or for the processor for the

140
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:44,909
people to understand that but data has

141
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:48,750
another advantage the fact that if it's

142
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:50,520
put back through the entire process if

143
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,279
the data goes back through people

144
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,529
processes and the technologies its beam

145
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,509
transport transformed into intelligence

146
00:05:55,529 --> 00:06:00,210
and it's being transformed into the

147
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:03,150
insights and those are actually the ones

148
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,270
that end up improving each one of them

149
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:09,150
so you end up solving problems and

150
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,669
solving security problems with an

151
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:15,779
intelligence approach on top of that and

152
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:18,139
that's actually the reason why we end up

153
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:20,310
being on top of these lists and

154
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:23,610
transforming security from just the

155
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,319
basic approach or maybe the compliance

156
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,210
security because we were talking about

157
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,300
compliance and just checking the boxes

158
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:33,120
that doesn't solve problems okay all of

159
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,849
us tend to be as high as possible on

160
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,399
this graphic right so maybe we end up

161
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:41,580
being proactive but the best thing is to

162
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:44,330
be predictive to understand what are the

163
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,900
threats that have the capability

164
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,240
of impacting our business right and how

165
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,099
can we actually put all these things

166
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,120
together what is actually the potential

167
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:57,889
of a threat to impact my business and

168
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,530
this is a graph that actually defines

169
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,080
what is a threat for the business it's a

170
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:07,900
mix of the capability the opportunity

171
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:10,280
and the hostile intent the thing is that

172
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,638
my presentation today will not be

173
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,698
focusing on apts will not be focusing on

174
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,940
nation-states because it's hard to

175
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:22,009
identify the host time in that right

176
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,110
it's hard to find when somebody has a

177
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:26,860
hostile intent until you end up looking

178
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,479
at the big picture but I will talk about

179
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,419
the usual cybercrime the one that is

180
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:34,969
most prevalent in our landscape right

181
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:37,969
because it's very rare that we end up

182
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:40,099
being attacked by an APD but it's very

183
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:42,889
often that we get a text from everybody

184
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,659
else right so usually the hostile intent

185
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:48,080
is always over there if you have a

186
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:50,779
business that has some data that means

187
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,180
that once the deepa gets licked out the

188
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:55,340
attacker might be having some advantages

189
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,050
like making money out of it so all the

190
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,239
time the fact they can make money on

191
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,009
your business that's always a hostile

192
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,009
intent they want to make money right as

193
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:06,409
that cyber crime so we need to focus on

194
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:08,960
those other two we need to focus on the

195
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:11,870
capabilities that these threats have and

196
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,870
actually the opportunities that these

197
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:17,060
threats have against my business against

198
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,659
my infrastructure and we will see that

199
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,639
so first of all let's talk about

200
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:24,589
capabilities which kind of capabilities

201
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,330
should by should I be looking at which

202
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:29,990
kind of capabilities should I be getting

203
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:32,149
visibility more and I might be trying to

204
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,519
get capability of a specific relevant

205
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:36,289
actor because we all know we should

206
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,019
start with what already happened to me

207
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:41,208
so if somebody at some point interacted

208
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:43,399
attacked me definitely I should be

209
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:46,250
looking into the current capabilities of

210
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,079
that particular threat actor but the the

211
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,850
problem is here is that we should

212
00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:52,399
actually look at the capability of any

213
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,190
threat act and to give you an example

214
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,240
imagine just a simple vulnerability

215
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:00,290
right the exploit is being popped

216
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,290
vulnerabilities being disclosed and

217
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,620
that's a capability that is available to

218
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:09,110
everybody any threat actor that wants to

219
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,279
make money and already has that

220
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:16,490
capability will be using it it all gets

221
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,320
back to the opportunity does he have an

222
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,320
opportunity to interact with your

223
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,450
business to attack you right so then if

224
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,149
it goes back to what is an actual

225
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,550
opportunity of a threat an opportunity

226
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:32,570
of a threat is basically whatever

227
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:34,699
defines you and I would I I wouldn't go

228
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,680
up to threat modeling I don't know how

229
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,040
many of you have ever done an exercise

230
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,479
of threat modeling but that's actually

231
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,449
measuring the opportunity that the

232
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,390
certain threat has against you okay

233
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:50,000
is what is your threat surface what are

234
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:53,000
the places that an attacker can actually

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,920
interact with you what is what are your

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,260
assets and what are your technologies

237
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,089
and we were talking over lunch the fact

238
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,130
that there were so many breaches in

239
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,959
which X filtration was done through

240
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,589
systems that were not even on the

241
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,569
inventory not even benched not even on

242
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,459
the inventory they didn't know about the

243
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,040
system it was a computer somewhere for

244
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:15,079
guts in a basement that nobody knew

245
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,079
about nobody was monitoring right and

246
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:21,019
that's an opportunity for the attacker

247
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,899
also we might be talking about specific

248
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:27,140
partners right maybe specific suppliers

249
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:30,079
because you have a weak chain in your

250
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,870
supply a weak link in your supply chain

251
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,390
that might be used and that might be an

252
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,660
opportunity for an attacker to email

253
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:41,930
okay and he can go even to operational

254
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:45,620
spaces specifics everybody's trying to

255
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,910
get banks and trying to exfiltrate money

256
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,040
and all that which is late they were

257
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:51,680
through Swift the reason why they're

258
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,390
matching managing to attack different

259
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,719
banks and to extract money is because

260
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:58,720
both all of them have some specific

261
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,680
operational aspects using that software

262
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,779
which can be exploitable right so

263
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,479
everything that goes into this area of

264
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:09,910
opportunity is everything that defines

265
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,220
you as

266
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,410
company is you'll be thinking if you're

267
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,850
defending yourself right I will be

268
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,819
caring about the people that I'm

269
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,800
interacting with the way I am the things

270
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,710
that I'm doing everyday in the way can

271
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,089
do that right so I need to understand

272
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,920
that I need to pay attention as a

273
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:31,990
business to everything that might be

274
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:37,030
considered an opportunity for the other

275
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:39,730
right so once I get visibility and I get

276
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:43,180
data about the attackers capabilities

277
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:46,030
and I understand what might be their

278
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,969
opportunities against me then I

279
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:51,430
understand the real potential of that

280
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,860
particular track and when I understand

281
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:58,449
the potential of that threat I need to

282
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:00,430
adapt because otherwise while the intent

283
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,510
is always over there to make money I

284
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,880
will be having the real threat targeting

285
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:09,430
so there is a saying that I love and

286
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,400
it's really directly connected to this

287
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:16,300
adapting stuff the fact that if the rate

288
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,550
of change on the outsides exceeds the

289
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,949
rate of change on the inside of your

290
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,880
company then the end is near and this is

291
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:28,090
by Jack Walsh a former G CEO so if I'm

292
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,939
not able to match the rate of change of

293
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:33,010
the threats that are on the outside most

294
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,470
definitely that will be in the end of my

295
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,569
business I need to understand them I

296
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,460
need to understand their capabilities I

297
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,140
need to understand their cup up is

298
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,500
against the opportunities that I might

299
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:47,050
be presenting to them right so I can

300
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,210
adapt I can adapt my infrastructure I

301
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,990
can adapt the way I'm doing things or I

302
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,640
can adapt I don't know even my controls

303
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:57,760
right it's not just about checking boxes

304
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,350
and compliance it's about checking the

305
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,340
boxes against the threats that are

306
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:06,340
actually relevant for me right so that

307
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,290
being let's say the conceptual part of

308
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,180
my presentation the fact that visibility

309
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,790
allows you to understand better the

310
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:15,310
capabilities and the opportunities and

311
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,560
the intent of a certain threat you might

312
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,000
be able to define if that threat is

313
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,729
really relevant for you and to

314
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,260
anticipate what you do in to adapt so I

315
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,680
will be applying that to

316
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:29,560
three use eases right and starting with

317
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,930
the most simple things direct mentions

318
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,180
related to the threat service and the

319
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,920
easiest and the most simple thing

320
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,370
related to the threat surface are leaked

321
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,740
potentials right and as you've seen in

322
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,410
earlier in the presentations even the

323
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,170
highest level a PT's they are running

324
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,449
spearfishing they are running fishing to

325
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,640
get some credentials and why are

326
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,400
potentials so important is because they

327
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,580
are turning an external threat into an

328
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:01,390
internal one right so they are jumping

329
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:04,600
it's the letter over the fence the

330
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:06,490
letter over the wall right and you've

331
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,110
heard what happens whenever it's an

332
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,760
internal threat nobody cares about it

333
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,980
nobody looks at it and usually

334
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,080
monitoring on internal system is not at

335
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,750
the highest level as it's on the

336
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,580
parameter right so what you're seeing

337
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,830
right now is actually distribution of

338
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,990
the last two months of leaked

339
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:26,590
credentials documents containing liquid

340
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:29,350
n shows on paste sites underground

341
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:32,110
forums and dark web and special access

342
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,420
and it's just two months every dot is

343
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:37,780
another document with leak credentials

344
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:41,050
right so as you can see out there there

345
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:43,209
are a lot of liquid oceans so once you

346
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,040
get visibility on these things that they

347
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,650
are out there right and you get access

348
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,930
to this data you can understand if

349
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,930
you're providing an opportunity for

350
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:55,660
somebody because your credentials are in

351
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,099
those lists so you can identify the

352
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,719
capabilities that they might be having

353
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,110
and the opportunity they might be having

354
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,600
but also this can also enhance your

355
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,670
defenses because I don't know I've

356
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,790
haven't heard about this and I actually

357
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:13,420
am building this on my own I have a big

358
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:16,750
database of no no passwords and hashes

359
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:19,510
that I shouldn't be using just because I

360
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,220
have visibility to the data if the

361
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,680
attackers in there are a lot of DDoS

362
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,900
tools or brute force tools against

363
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,630
systems of bodies that are actually

364
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:31,000
using these open available credentials

365
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:34,360
so once in my company I get visibility

366
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,950
on that why not close the opportunity of

367
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,519
the attackers that are using that as a

368
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:41,200
capability right by making sure that my

369
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:46,720
internal passwords and hashes are not

370
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,579
mentioned so once I get visibility in

371
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,730
that landscape I can start influencing

372
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:54,670
and adapting so I can minimize their

373
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,230
capabilities and of course be able to

374
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:59,170
cover the opportunities that they may be

375
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,670
have and this is just an example of the

376
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,959
things related to the tread surface

377
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:05,229
because it's a login

378
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:07,630
other things might be for example this

379
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,959
one it's a list of emails with a clear

380
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:14,320
title may list for spend by this

381
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,420
protector so immediately understand the

382
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,640
intent if I'm on that list

383
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,709
oh that straight actor has an intent

384
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,740
against me right and more than that

385
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:26,079
because I have the data about the name I

386
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,050
can start investigating a lot of

387
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,939
capabilities so I can see if against my

388
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,000
oh my do opportunities that I'm

389
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,459
presenting that's a real threat right

390
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,519
also I need to understand that threat

391
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:41,229
surface means everything that defines me

392
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,829
getting back to the opportunities file

393
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:49,089
it can be anything like domains it can

394
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:52,359
be IPS it can be systems with operating

395
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:54,339
systems and ports opens everything that

396
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,730
is a port open the world is an

397
00:16:54,339 --> 00:17:02,399
opportunity for an attacker to target

398
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:05,140
right so out of this first use case is

399
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,059
understanding and getting visibility on

400
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,730
that that is related directly to my

401
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:12,730
threat surface and understanding their

402
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,799
capabilities I can start at that and I

403
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:18,220
can start closing the opportunities for

404
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:22,480
the attackers just by looking over data

405
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:25,480
that is related to my threat surface the

406
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,640
second use case is risk based

407
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,910
vulnerability patching program would be

408
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,600
would be visibility and having access to

409
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:37,510
data that is available right be

410
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,928
enhancing my approach in that and I

411
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:43,090
would say yes first of all this is just

412
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:44,800
a simple timeline of all over

413
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,350
vulnerability and exploit against the

414
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,530
vulnerability yeah so we have the disk

415
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,000
our

416
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,379
three of the vulnerability which might

417
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,220
happen somewhere in the underground

418
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:57,160
right and we might be having an exploit

419
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,560
of that it's I noted as an exploit of

420
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,720
Technology because there is no CV there

421
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,820
is no definition of the vulnerability in

422
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,730
that moment is just an exploit against

423
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,800
the technology also we have the

424
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,960
disclosure time and then then we have

425
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,600
the actual exploit of the vulnerability

426
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,430
after the disclosure and of course then

427
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,800
scanner is being built model being

428
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:21,190
builds vulnerability being added to this

429
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:24,220
exploit kits and so on so it would be

430
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,590
wonderful if I would be able to perform

431
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,500
some mitigation actions because I have

432
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,240
visibility at this point right if I know

433
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,040
how they are exploiting the technology

434
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,930
and I know that I'm using that

435
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,530
technology so it's an opportunity for

436
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:40,330
them I can start adapting maybe my I

437
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,430
don't know my infrastructure the way

438
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:46,540
things are communicating so I can close

439
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:49,180
that opportunity or of course if the

440
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,430
vulnerability has always already been

441
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,190
disclosed I can start by getting

442
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:57,100
visibility to prioritize things right

443
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,320
which one is actually being exploited in

444
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:01,510
the wild so I know which one to touch

445
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:06,250
first like because I can close their

446
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:08,170
capability right so the idea is that

447
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,140
once I get visibility and this is

448
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,280
actually a timeline of the SMB

449
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,930
vulnerability that started eternal blue

450
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,530
and then wanna cry okay

451
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:20,080
so this is what on the lower part you're

452
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,730
seeing events about the disclosure on

453
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,120
the higher part of the screen you're

454
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:27,940
seeing events against the technology and

455
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,199
we have and basically this is time zero

456
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,040
this is the moment when the

457
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,120
vulnerability was disclosed right so

458
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,399
everything that happened before the

459
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,120
pattern of how how visible it is but we

460
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,340
have smb3 connect zero they PLC we have

461
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:46,060
the exploit of zero day vulnerability in

462
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,990
SMB protocol is published so available

463
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:52,389
data visibility available right load

464
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:56,050
library of of library over SMB

465
00:19:52,390 --> 00:20:01,270
determined or his version the SMB all of

466
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:03,250
that our capabilities of actors against

467
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:06,180
this technology if I have this

468
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:09,160
technology which also is an opportunity

469
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,840
that's a potential threat so if I

470
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,310
understand and I have this ability over

471
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:17,830
this I can easily start adapting right

472
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:20,110
and also the same thing happens on the

473
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:23,230
right side of the timeline right because

474
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:25,179
I have I have here the vulnerability

475
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,400
being disclosed and I have the moment

476
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:31,540
when the exploit was actually published

477
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:34,840
which was eternal blue after that things

478
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,820
started getting crazy right so if I have

479
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,790
the vulnerability I also have the

480
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,649
patching if I have this visibility I can

481
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,290
start understanding that this is really

482
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,930
important and I should be patching that

483
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:50,139
with a priority because otherwise I

484
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:52,510
might be getting hit right so couple of

485
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,690
examples of what happens afterwards

486
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:59,140
people started publishing on github for

487
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:02,140
example PLC's everything you see is

488
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,240
Python scripts PLC's on how to run

489
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,420
eternal blue how to exploit Windows 10

490
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,170
how to exploit Windows 2012 different

491
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,350
PLC's

492
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:15,430
so that's the clear capability and of

493
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:20,199
course after that it started fire less

494
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:23,200
ransomware uux to a pentia wanna cry and

495
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,640
a lot of others ending up with people

496
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,530
running services of delivering malware

497
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,720
based on that vulnerability so it's an

498
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,760
entire ecosystem and I think Alan will

499
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,480
be talking a bit more about the

500
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,030
ecosystem behind that afterwards but the

501
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,250
idea is that once you get visibility as

502
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:45,040
soon as possible on this exploitation

503
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:48,730
timeline you can understand how to adapt

504
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:53,590
or how to prioritize your pension right

505
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:55,240
and the last example that I had was I'm

506
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:58,000
always getting this question should I be

507
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,720
given what happens to others it hadn't

508
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,050
happened to me is visibility over what

509
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,580
happens to others relevant to me is it

510
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,550
increasing my chances of solving

511
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:12,879
security problems and the answer is

512
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,230
definitely yes and I'll show you why so

513
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,390
this is an example of

514
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,250
Tector called the dark overlords I don't

515
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,460
know how many of you have heard of it of

516
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,410
him oh it's a team actually it's

517
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,480
supposed to be a team initially was

518
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:29,799
thought it's just one guy but seems to

519
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:32,190
be more than one and the time line on

520
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:35,740
the top shows things that he published

521
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:38,350
the time line above shows things that

522
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:41,679
were published about him and his actions

523
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:45,100
right so if we're looking on that we can

524
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,770
see that I don't know mid-2016

525
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,549
this guy was into breaching health care

526
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:53,500
companies in us like very heavily

527
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:56,590
breaching them in publishing and selling

528
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,919
databases of patients personal

529
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:03,790
identification information and more than

530
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:06,330
that he was also disclosing the way he

531
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:09,010
was doing that so we have things like

532
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,500
from a severely misconfigured network

533
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:14,919
using readily available plaintext

534
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,049
usernames and passwords and that's two

535
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:20,740
cases and that's actually three cases

536
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:23,700
and also RDP without any kind of like

537
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:26,830
default credentials like admin admin so

538
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,750
it's not very high level of course he

539
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,760
used some zero days as well so he's

540
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:33,520
quite big in the business but the idea

541
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,070
is that sometimes the opportunity that

542
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,309
is presented to the threat actor is

543
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:41,950
something that cannot be missed and it

544
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,600
ends up being like that so he did a lot

545
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,280
of things in the healthcare and of

546
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,168
course if you were a healthcare company

547
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,720
you would care about that because it

548
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:54,100
happened to others but at some point

549
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:58,240
after sometime late 2016 this guy

550
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:01,360
started reaching others with probably

551
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,370
the same capabilities just because the

552
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,189
intent was the same making some money

553
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:09,270
and it was presented with a new

554
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,679
opportunity making more money because

555
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:13,360
there are more money into the finance

556
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,030
industry right

557
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,370
so he started hacking finance industry

558
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:22,510
and the first one was Westport Capital

559
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:26,399
Bank and what I want to emphasize here

560
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:28,000
is that this Bank had a lot of customers

561
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,160
the problem

562
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,220
is that all of those customers were

563
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,550
immediately offended so they needed to

564
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:39,400
adapt if they wouldn't know about that

565
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:41,680
and believe me there are some like

566
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,010
Pegram reputation investigations that

567
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,530
were holded by that bank and different

568
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,379
other very powerful documents that were

569
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:52,360
hauled by that bank that was breached

570
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:55,390
unless you are you're you get visibility

571
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,409
over this you don't know how to adapt

572
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,670
yeah

573
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:06,990
and further on this guy started

574
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:09,300
attacking media companies so if you

575
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,510
understand that he is like actually

576
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:15,280
switching depending on the opportunity

577
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:18,280
and the intent is all always over there

578
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,610
just wants to make money you should be

579
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:24,160
knowing about this guy and it actually

580
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:26,939
happens that first of all he hacked

581
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:30,510
Larson studios which was a cub

582
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:34,000
post-production company which was a

583
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:39,520
partner I was our supplier for companies

584
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,590
like ABC or Netflix so after some time

585
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,850
because he breached one of their

586
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:49,230
suppliers let's say of services and they

587
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:52,810
didn't adapt it on that they ended up

588
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:57,280
some month later like in the mid 2017

589
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:59,110
being extorted because this guy wanted

590
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,350
to lick some things that he's told from

591
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:04,750
the previous bridge right and you know

592
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:08,169
what happened they leaked some some some

593
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:10,390
movies and but the idea is that once you

594
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:14,470
get visibility and you get access to

595
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:16,750
data that is available right you can

596
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,000
understand things that might be

597
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,680
happening to you right because you

598
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,630
understand the opportunities that you're

599
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,400
presenting and the opportunities

600
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,920
sometimes are presented through the

601
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,960
partners and through the customers that

602
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:32,320
you have through the entire supply chain

603
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,630
what even is just an opportunity that

604
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,810
manifested itself somewhere to in some

605
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:40,060
other company that was never in your

606
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:41,440
landscape but the fact that you might be

607
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,840
affected by the same thing

608
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,970
makes it important for you so if it

609
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,168
happened it might be happening to you

610
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:51,250
because you have the same opportunity

611
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:54,190
presented against the attack so that

612
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:56,049
being told oh I remember I have another

613
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:59,350
one this is quite funny the reason why I

614
00:26:56,049 --> 00:27:04,899
put it here is because it's so so

615
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:09,399
obvious so this is a both bank duty this

616
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:12,279
is early March let's a needle March and

617
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:14,889
this is early April end of March one

618
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:18,870
bank suffering SMS fishing camps this

619
00:27:14,889 --> 00:27:21,699
was like announced the campaign was

620
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:26,289
public people reported it on Twitter

621
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:29,950
this is like fishing over SMS right not

622
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:34,000
more than two weeks afterwards customers

623
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:37,690
from another Bank from UK one of them

624
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,009
actually got lost 23 K from the same

625
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:44,620
scheme so if this bank would just have

626
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:46,120
had disability over this particular

627
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,699
event that happened like two weeks

628
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,428
before that he would actually started a

629
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,409
campaign and they could have added it in

630
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:58,059
order for that not to be happening to

631
00:27:53,409 --> 00:28:00,370
their customers right so it is important

632
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:03,668
to get visibility and just as a

633
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:06,549
conclusion to this I think that while we

634
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:09,279
have a pyramid of pain we should also be

635
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:11,230
having a pyramid of interest and that

636
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,379
pyramid of interest should be covering

637
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:17,169
everything from your threat surface your

638
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:19,600
technologies your assets subsidiaries

639
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:21,820
partners peers and you should be

640
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,908
interested about what happening in the

641
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:27,039
global landscape because you don't know

642
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:28,539
maybe somebody has a capability against

643
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,389
your opportunities that are your

644
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:33,549
presenting that transforms something

645
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:35,860
that is a global threat into a threat

646
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:38,590
that might be impacting you and for that

647
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:41,320
of course you need data and you need

648
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:45,459
let's say relevant data and you need

649
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:48,340
means in order to get it and to make it

650
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,889
understandable so you need the broad

651
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,480
visibility you need relevance in time

652
00:28:50,889 --> 00:28:54,510
because you need to find out about those

653
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,309
things as early as possible

654
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:59,340
the equation chain as soon as they

655
00:28:56,309 --> 00:29:01,049
happens to others and of course we need

656
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:05,159
to understand that we need to have a mix

657
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:07,799
of technologies humans and processes

658
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,809
with data on top of it in order to make

659
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,429
things happen and to be able to solve

660
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:12,928
those security problems that we were

661
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:17,790
talking about at the beginning

662
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:19,530
so thank you very much that was all for

663
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:25,379
me so if you have any questions I'll be

664
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:28,070
more than pleased as now if not thank

665
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:31,310
