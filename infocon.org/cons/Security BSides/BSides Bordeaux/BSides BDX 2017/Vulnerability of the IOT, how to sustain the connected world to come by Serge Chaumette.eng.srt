1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,730
okay so I'm going to talk about

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,579
vulnerabilities of the Internet of

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,590
Things or I'm not specialized in Afric

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,510
management or fraternity returns back we

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,090
have a number of issues there were

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,520
companies and my goal this morning is to

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,259
share these questions with you and put

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,890
simply get answers I'm not sure I will

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,810
but anyway we can discuss that so I'm

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,050
working at a company which is called the

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,449
NSC I honest interactive we are working

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,790
for instance for the French railway

13
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:38,670
company where we are developing a

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,589
maintenance system along the tracks and

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,200
of course it means that we connect

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,960
objects to some background and to some

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,820
Bekasi software at the same time I have

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,270
a position at the University of Bordeaux

19
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,770
I'm a professor in computer science

20
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,410
specialised in a network to peer

21
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:01,850
communication and I'm also I'd have a

22
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:04,559
large amount of activity on drones so

23
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,170
many industrial applications now as you

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,298
know are using the Internet of Things so

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,549
the things are available in the physical

26
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,590
world but they begin to be available

27
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,789
also in your body for instance this is a

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,759
capacity system that has been designed

29
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:22,740
by the sea bug nest company and it can

30
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,659
be invented in your body and it gives

31
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,068
you some sort of sixth sense which means

32
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,959
that when you are directed toward north

33
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,789
there is a vibration and you know you

34
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:32,520
are in the direction so it brings a new

35
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:35,399
new sense to you but it also mean but

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,298
it's new gates for for acting for

37
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:42,270
instance so let's have a quick look at

38
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,009
the figures of the IOT of course we all

39
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,039
know but the number of connected object

40
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,049
is increasing but the question is a work

41
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:51,179
table the domains in which it is

42
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,399
increasing or of course you know in

43
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:56,819
companies in the guggenheim at

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,340
infrastructures and of course in in in

45
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:02,090
the pub of everyone and if you look at

46
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,159
more precisely at what happens at home

47
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,319
these are the kind of objects that are

48
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,800
being deployed in the real world of

49
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:14,460
course the figure already force because

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,470
it was done in 2013 and what we

51
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,110
scheduled we are

52
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,000
all ready for by under the target which

53
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,010
is which is given air still the thing

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,120
which is important is that what is

55
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,739
referred to as the Internet of Things

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,150
which is Bailey basically the many

57
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,480
objects that you have a table is

58
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:33,580
increasing by a large amount which means

59
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,579
that it can raise many many issues

60
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,710
the thing which interests me and where

61
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:41,900
we have question is not the risk related

62
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,570
to the backhoe fees for instance or the

63
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,670
way this object and we act doing first

64
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,829
on our network but the thing is that we

65
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,609
are connected to the real world you not

66
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,170
only have sensors like say temperature

67
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,240
or whatever but you also have a

68
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,869
traitor's which means that you can do

69
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,910
something on the world and so these kind

70
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,730
of objects can be said with input from

71
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:10,220
the outside but they can also act on the

72
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:12,799
outside world there is a strong belief

73
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,790
which is that when you have no physical

74
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,350
connection no network basically you have

75
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,670
some security of course this is what is

76
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,070
thought by most people but we all know

77
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:28,190
that it is not the case for instance

78
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:31,880
when you look at the us-canadian border

79
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:34,640
at Niagara Falls you can be lived by the

80
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,850
US side is secured from the Canadian

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,309
side but the guys in marketing they

82
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,380
quickly understood that it's not okay

83
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,810
you can some sort of leak information

84
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,440
from website that can be seen on your

85
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,570
left side

86
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,640
so instance the the casinos can made

87
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,380
some advertisement that can be seen from

88
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,390
the from the Canadian border transact

89
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,120
people in the US border so a recorder

90
00:03:53,390 --> 00:04:00,109
sources of input but needs to be

91
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,489
considered it reminds me of to some work

92
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:06,560
we'll be doing a few years ago a

93
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:08,959
university the side channel attack where

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,120
basically what you do is you observe

95
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,880
some information that leaks from a board

96
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,980
for instance this can be timing

97
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,690
overconsumption temperature and so on

98
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,260
and based on this information that leaks

99
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:23,240
you try to do to build a model of the

100
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,539
board that you are using for instance in

101
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,870
this case you can

102
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,730
you can trace every side part of their

103
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,160
every site good behavior just by

104
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,360
offsetting the power consumption of the

105
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,470
border of course there are

106
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:41,680
countermeasures designed and implemented

107
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,690
by the board manufacturers but we know

108
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,580
that there are additional issues that

109
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,530
arise thereafter but it basically looks

110
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,780
the same various information but leaks

111
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,299
and that you can observe the thing which

112
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,710
is I think an issue with the Internet of

113
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,660
Things is that it goes the other way

114
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,000
around which means that information from

115
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,850
the outside world can be fed inside your

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,550
objective and you did not expect that so

117
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,830
you have to deal with that one of the

118
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,140
reason why I chose this topic was from

119
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,570
his presentation is the recent DNA

120
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:15,580
sequencer attack but has been described

121
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:18,370
widely on the web well basically there

122
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:25,030
is nothing new it just an attack where

123
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:27,970
you ask some sort of input with quite

124
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,260
standard attack it still began making me

125
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,820
think about what can happen me to

126
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,530
Internet of Things and we obtain the

127
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:41,830
subjects the basic idea is this was this

128
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:45,700
attack was to occurred a virus inside as

129
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:48,280
a DNA sequence to centralize the DNA

130
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,039
that corresponds to each sequence to put

131
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,770
that in a sequencing machine so that it

132
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,020
is compromised and that the virus can be

133
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,760
run on the sequencer machine so this is

134
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,260
what they did of course it was quite

135
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,120
easy for her because they had all the

136
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,520
software of the sequencing machine plus

137
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,490
additional information so it is most

138
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,530
likely it will not work or it won't it

139
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,660
will not work long in the real world

140
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:14,099
because countermeasures can be adapted

141
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:18,850
still it's a way to enter a system

142
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:20,980
another way to enter system all of you

143
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,560
have seen that recently is the Google

144
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,620
home that has been the target of many

145
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,320
attacks ah well basically I could say

146
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,840
Google X Google during the Superbowl it

147
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:35,800
was new tracking but what you get is

148
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,780
something that studied before it

149
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,920
happened

150
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,780
during the Super Bowl there was a

151
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,790
commercial about the Google pub and

152
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,119
again the commercial said okay booger

153
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:50,250
and most many of the Google part around

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:54,180
the US began doing something there are

155
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:59,250
so this is some of the tweets that

156
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:01,110
Rachel did from the from the city they

157
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,419
also suffered the many of their attacks

158
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,710
on where is what we shall especially

159
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,450
like which is what I could the Burger

160
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:09,630
King attack there was an advertisement

161
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,610
the commercial by Burger King and they

162
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,200
said plenty of good things nice things

163
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,550
about Burger King and at the end they

164
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,700
said if you want additional information

165
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:21,090
just say okay popular Burger King and of

166
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,280
course you know what happens there is

167
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,109
another attack which is more this one is

168
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,489
not Ronnie own attacks or Tiffany but we

169
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,200
cannot consider viral attack something

170
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,450
which is an attack is a miss Norton

171
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,320
attack that has been done by by into

172
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:36,630
Chinese talking about REM just before

173
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,750
the basic idea of the dolphin attack is

174
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,669
that your record okay Google on some

175
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,729
simple device you change the frequency

176
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:47,549
of the of the voice of the sound and you

177
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:50,190
replay that and if you targets

178
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,680
frequencies that cannot be earned by you

179
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,830
mana but that can still be understood by

180
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,169
the device it worked and so this is what

181
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,060
they did and they targeted an exact and

182
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:02,460
a theory and many others own and there

183
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,310
is a nice table but summarizes what

184
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:12,570
happened and you see that it's been

185
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:16,200
working on many many devices so it's a

186
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:18,210
way to work Internet of Things or many

187
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:22,169
different objects or mobile phones or

188
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:24,750
assistants just by using the hood when

189
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,909
they are supposed to deal with still

190
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,280
without using any network connection or

191
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,010
whatever there are many other things

192
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,299
that you can act using the input of the

193
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,760
system you can like a chicken for

194
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,859
instance you can easily no ties the

195
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,599
chicken and you have the process here if

196
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,780
you want to try if you have a chicken at

197
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,780
home you can try with you you cannot so

198
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,449
act someone's brain there is a nice 2d

199
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,630
that shows that basically everyone is

200
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,220
affinity so by

201
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,770
like you just have to find the proper

202
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:00,570
frequency for each person and you can

203
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:04,680
create in English and it BMC crisis you

204
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:06,720
know the seizure you can create a

205
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,939
seizure just by selecting the proper

206
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,000
frequency and you know that there are

207
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,250
many birds that can now be connected

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,410
they can now be a switched on and off

209
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,030
using either Bluetooth Low Energy or

210
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,880
whatever so it's something which is

211
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:23,370
quite quite easy to do and once again

212
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,590
it's a way to act this case the brain of

213
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,860
someone just by choosing all the inputs

214
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:31,020
but connect the person to the world so

215
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,230
you don't need a physical access to some

216
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:36,329
sort of project to the person of course

217
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,960
most of these attackers based on the

218
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:42,900
standard and the basic booth overflow

219
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,520
approach and many of the attacks that

220
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,230
has been demonstrated of course they are

221
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,510
working it but they also are based on

222
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,460
the fact that the choices are widely

223
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,050
available of course you need to know if

224
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,420
you want to do that quickly which was

225
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:58,099
the case if you know the the code which

226
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,099
is behind of course it's easier to do

227
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,960
something that has been said before is

228
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:07,590
that now you are so many systems to

229
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:12,210
collect a lot of data and to process the

230
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:14,220
data but once you have access to a

231
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,020
number of connected objects of course is

232
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,520
very powerful because you can have

233
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,210
access to information about people or

234
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,040
about companies you can do deep learning

235
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,630
on the data and so on so it's really

236
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,560
nice you to be able to collect this data

237
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:31,439
so easily

238
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:34,050
I became interesting recently you know

239
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,610
what is called transhumanism which as

240
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,959
far as I understand consists in

241
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,720
augmenting

242
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,600
adding new features to the human what I

243
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,730
was describing with this compass at the

244
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,900
beginning of my talk basically goes in

245
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:52,620
the direction and of course when we are

246
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:56,880
connected in some way it becomes becomes

247
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:00,780
difficult to avoid these a keying

248
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,580
techniques but I just described for one

249
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:07,630
do not read French

250
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:10,690
has been augmented with d2l two features

251
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:13,149
and the doctor is saying the good news

252
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,760
is that you are as intelligent as a r2d2

253
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:17,140
the bad news is that does you been sorry

254
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:25,510
the bad news is when do you have the

255
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:27,189
same voice we can even go further still

256
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,649
using the same techniques you know about

257
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,920
the City Year project the search for

258
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:36,910
extraterrestrial intelligences

259
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,040
the idea being to listen to radio

260
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,860
signals coming from outer space and try

261
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,219
to identify some intelligent pattern of

262
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,760
course we can imagine ET arcing earth by

263
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,940
pushing information to the city project

264
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,939
why not

265
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,800
so the question is how can we avoid that

266
00:11:54,310 --> 00:12:00,880
is it possible to avoid this kind of

267
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,099
attack so I have more question on rather

268
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,870
than solution as you can guess one

269
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,149
solution is to avoid any interaction

270
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:11,740
with the outside which is basically not

271
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:13,750
feasible your solution is to define and

272
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,610
check the input definition domain I will

273
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:19,120
show you that this is not also possible

274
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:22,660
for many so many reasons why is it not

275
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,060
possible we have the physical world with

276
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,779
all the input that can be generated by

277
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:31,239
the physical world we have the filtered

278
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:34,570
input which is accepted by your valued

279
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,870
object by a device which is modern in

280
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:41,230
most cases than the real physical world

281
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:43,180
and you have the part of the signals

282
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:47,380
which is expected by your application

283
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:50,739
and as you can see there is this red

284
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:54,189
area which is possibly generated by the

285
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,170
real world which is not filtered but

286
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,149
which is filtered which is kept by you

287
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,640
filter when you collect the signal from

288
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:04,750
the outside but that you did not expect

289
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:07,680
in your application and this is the area

290
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:11,589
that you can use to generate signal to

291
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,050
push it to the device and to try to AK

292
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:16,089
the device using this information and

293
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,040
this is what is done with all the

294
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:22,620
examples

295
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:28,969
I have shown before what a one-piece

296
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:31,710
ebert solution that solution is a

297
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:34,800
direction that might be interesting to

298
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,790
explore is to use a trusted device to

299
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,670
manage your input

300
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,370
the idea would be to collect signals

301
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,800
coming from to outside inside a trusted

302
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,620
device to some sort of additional

303
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,199
filtering and then push it back to the

304
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,550
processing system I don't have to do

305
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,170
that I don't know if it's a proper

306
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,089
solution I don't even know if it's

307
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:57,270
feasible but it's a direction that we

308
00:13:54,090 --> 00:14:00,480
are beginning to explore so I went good

309
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:03,110
here any idea any solution any question

310
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,110
thank you

311
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:21,060
actually collects all the signal after

312
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,610
the filtering and actually without

313
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:30,030
impacting the real world actually

314
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:32,250
simulates and then depending on the

315
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,959
output another layer of filtering will

316
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,870
be applied and only the signal that is

317
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,840
not in that red area will be pushed to

318
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,420
the real end point machine probably we

319
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,430
have so this is quite close to the

320
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,380
configuration so you are running instead

321
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,060
of just filter it you are running or the

322
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,890
processing that and see what happens on

323
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,800
the thing is that you probably get back

324
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:55,170
to the same picture which is this area

325
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,969
not in the input but in the output that

326
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,069
which you knew not but you will not be

327
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,170
able to evaluate so you will generate

328
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,490
things in the real world but you will

329
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,870
compare it to something which is

330
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,760
expected but there is always a

331
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,590
difference between what will be done and

332
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,810
what you expect to compare so we get

333
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:15,530
back to the same feature I think yeah

334
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,530
yeah yes

335
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:34,059
wait maybe these devices non making them

336
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:41,138
unable to connect that scale to have to

337
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:43,980
not operate as it does seem like one of

338
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:47,709
the issues here is together

339
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,509
power yeah there are two points in your

340
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:51,809
question if we consider the network

341
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:54,730
aspects I think we can use standard

342
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:56,019
procedure for student work to do but we

343
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:58,029
can use standard procedures

344
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:00,540
what again to issue the thing which is

345
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:03,129
new is whether they use different

346
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,199
communication systems for instance there

347
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,209
is a nice video on the web wherever I've

348
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,118
put the Google form and the radix up

349
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:12,910
from Amazon they took together and it

350
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:15,519
generates a look and the system keeps on

351
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,679
looping looping looping and doesn't stop

352
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:22,179
so we have two things on the network

353
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:24,429
side I think we can work with the usual

354
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:26,350
tools even if we still have some work to

355
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:27,610
do but once again there is something

356
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,559
which has not been addressed I think

357
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,149
regarding the different kind of input

358
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:34,240
but we are not accustomed within the

359
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:39,459
standard network world it's not rather

360
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,819
an answer just just ideas any other

361
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,819
question

362
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,369
you
