1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,519
thank you very much okay we'll dive

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,248
right in so you've all have seen the the

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,259
book that I published two years ago when

4
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:15,639
I first started writing that book I was

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:19,930
right it's a business book it's about

6
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:22,689
conquering the Chinese market okay and I

7
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:25,410
did anticipate that I would spend a

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:28,030
great deal of time investigating fraud

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,759
as well as other crimes and my

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,730
investigation led me to different

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,579
countries and at one point it led me to

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:40,089
a pub in England where I was meeting

13
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:41,949
with an undercover investigator and this

14
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:43,920
is a man who was nearing retirement and

15
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:47,230
he'd spent his entire career

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,949
investigating counterfeits in China so

17
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:53,578
he was the guy to go to so I and I had

18
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:57,280
just come back from China where I had I

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,280
seen already quite a lot on the topic I

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,629
talked to a lot of people a lot of

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,670
Chinese wine growers as well as people

22
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:06,280
dealing imported wines so I knew this

23
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,020
was a big topic very complicated so I

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,549
asked him after we talked I wanted him

25
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,589
also find out how he did his undercover

26
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:15,369
investigation some of the tricks of the

27
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:18,490
trade and I said so you know what do you

28
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:22,899
do would it what do we do and he said

29
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:25,060
you make it as complicated as difficult

30
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:28,000
as possible for them to copy your

31
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:32,409
product so they move on to the next

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,969
person I thought okay so there was no

33
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:35,320
rounding up the counterfeiters or you

34
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,119
know and putting them in jail or having

35
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,279
them stopped the idea was just to get

36
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:45,969
them to move along now this is a big big

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,009
topic fake was a huge topic so think of

38
00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:50,199
this as just a primer this is just a

39
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:53,590
short course and I'm gonna try and hit

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,240
the main topics okay so hopefully by the

41
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,960
end of this you'll have an idea what the

42
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02,048
what the big ideas are what some of the

43
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,389
methods are being used okay and maybe

44
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,740
I'm thinking because this is your this

45
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,669
is your business you might have some

46
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:12,099
ideas okay okay what are weaving by

47
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:14,079
shape wine this is anybody your work in

48
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,470
the wine business or have contacts with

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,530
the wine

50
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:43,540
business okay what do we think of when

51
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:45,040
we think of fake life okay well that I

52
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,560
mean that's that's it right there

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,060
so either have refilled bottles the real

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,030
bottles memory filled with something

55
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,250
else you have a very like Alice had a

56
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,520
very poor quality fake that wouldn't

57
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,110
wouldn't fool anybody who's a real

58
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,410
consumer or someone in the wine trade if

59
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,050
high quality fakes are very difficult to

60
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:08,680
figure out you have wine makers use

61
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:11,080
their own brand and they put a wine that

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,360
does not correspond with the label in

63
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,220
the bottle and then we're going to touch

64
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:21,070
on the IP war on brand squatting okay so

65
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,720
here's here's here's a photo I pulled up

66
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,790
that this is the Chinese authorities had

67
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,800
done this right now this is not just in

68
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,230
China this happens to be from there

69
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,120
someone had collected used bottles real

70
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,429
authentic bottle so they're gonna refill

71
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,260
this is an old scam it's been going on

72
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,989
as long as there has been bottled wine

73
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,579
okay very low-tech

74
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,040
very easy you could start with a long

75
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,560
bottle and you're a business okay and

76
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,660
just so happens as if they knew you guys

77
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,360
were coming I was giving this talk this

78
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:54,880
week an ex-con and they pollo stick who

79
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,650
lived in Lorene was just sentenced to

80
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,470
got an 18-month suspended prison

81
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:03,430
sentence for selling fake patrece on

82
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,720
eBay and if I keep gone legit and this

83
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,700
was for then he was running low on

84
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,950
retirement funds I guess so he started

85
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,119
and he's a real wine lover so he filled

86
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,160
it with really good wine

87
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,900
he chose something and that was his

88
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,340
thing he wasn't putting bad wine in

89
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,200
there he was putting some actually some

90
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,910
classified growth in the bottle but they

91
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,180
caught him so they're suspicious

92
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,760
customers eventually alerted the Chateau

93
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,030
and the police and he slipped up because

94
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,520
of the length of a cork and

95
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,150
way them one of the labels was fixed

96
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,440
okay but the average consumer probably

97
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,940
wouldn't have figured out those were

98
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,090
fakes and he made about a hundred

99
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,430
thousand euros in 18 months of which

100
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:45,119
nineteen thousand was left for me when

101
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,190
they caught him okay sloppy fakes these

102
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,130
are really if you know anything about

103
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:53,490
why these are easy - easy easy to notice

104
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,070
look at Nissan Montpellier okay that

105
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,530
should be a nice hot glue tape

106
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,930
well my Conti is is a is a is a red wine

107
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,880
it's not a white wine I mean is there's

108
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,040
so many mistakes on there yeah if you

109
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,190
don't read if you presume what if your

110
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,470
your your you have a language of does

111
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,030
not use alphabet what if you don't read

112
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,160
French you know

113
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,900
I'm not sure my mother who's a very

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,040
intelligent woman would know that's a

115
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,870
fake okay sup there but there but for

116
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,090
the wine trays they're easy to figure

117
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:29,870
out châtelet the feet okay these are all

118
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:32,159
what this means for the wine trade is it

119
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,740
you're still in the early stages of

120
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,860
counterfeiting because this assumes a

121
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,820
gullible market and the counterfeiters

122
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:44,160
haven't really got very good at it okay

123
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:48,630
then we have high quality things the

124
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,090
poster child for this is Rudy this is

125
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,310
somebody who had a great deal of

126
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,590
sophistication he knew a lot about wine

127
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,380
and he was buddies with all the big

128
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:01,590
collectors he was finally caught out

129
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:06,150
because he tried to sell vintages a

130
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:09,299
famous one that didn't exist okay and it

131
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,700
happened to be that the wine maker you

132
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,169
they look at the option sizes you there

133
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,820
ones are going up for sale he's like

134
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:18,979
wait a minute we didn't we didn't bottle

135
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:22,169
those messages so he interceded okay and

136
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:26,280
Rudy has a 10-year prison sentence as

137
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:28,080
well as hefty hefty fines so this is the

138
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,520
one that I run into the most and this is

139
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,450
I always hear it's just still grape

140
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,159
juice okay how many people I interviewed

141
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,370
who've been convicted of this crime who

142
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:39,969
told me the same thing again a very old

143
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,849
scam this

144
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:45,489
of winemaker a wine producer who has

145
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:48,579
real brands real labels real bottles

146
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:51,969
they own and instead of saying pudding

147
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:53,649
for instance coke de Rome in it they're

148
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:57,669
buying some bulk wine from somewhere

149
00:06:53,649 --> 00:07:01,179
put it in there a table wine okay so

150
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:04,179
these can be in the millions of bottles

151
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:05,979
here's some recent cases this guy was

152
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:07,989
just this summer this is still an

153
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:10,808
alleged fraud but I've spoken to the

154
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:12,099
prosecutors and the investigation will

155
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:14,229
go on for a while because it's so

156
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,688
complex and so much money involved but

157
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:19,449
he's out on a 1.2 million dollar bail

158
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:21,999
right now and he is the head of this is

159
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:25,059
a multi-million dollar company a big big

160
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:28,029
company this in different countries okay

161
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:31,439
and he risked it all for you know a

162
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:34,449
couple million bottles of feet wine um

163
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,439
this guy's local he's from a big wine

164
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:41,139
family very wealthy he owes 20 chateaus

165
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:44,679
and he's gonna do two years in prison

166
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:46,569
for 1.1 million bottles and what he was

167
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:49,628
doing was buying up cheap table wine

168
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:52,050
from desperate wine growers in the north

169
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:54,279
of the Bordeaux region guys who who'd

170
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,379
you know they usually have second jobs

171
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,479
they could barely they can't make a

172
00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:00,069
living at wine so if somebody comes

173
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,938
along says I'll give you cash for it of

174
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:08,139
course they're gonna be tempted okay he

175
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:12,459
he took that cheap wine and put it in

176
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:16,499
his own his very prestigious appellation

177
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:16,499
sentimental okay

178
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:22,689
now this I love this one 18 million

179
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:25,809
bottles of fake Pinot Noir most of us

180
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:29,110
all to gallo and constellation okay I

181
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:31,809
get these guys that the profit was seven

182
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:34,740
million euros and look what their fines

183
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:37,479
were it's like a slap on the wrist

184
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:43,409
they're still in business you got all

185
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:45,790
the big wine trade shows are there so

186
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:52,149
this is all to say that China did not

187
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:53,339
invent fake wine okay boom Bordeaux what

188
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,520
China has done

189
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,680
is its horse the wine trade the up its

190
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,840
game in a way that I think is really

191
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,209
significant but first I want you to

192
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:08,220
understand what we're doing in China why

193
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:10,050
it's so important okay this is this is a

194
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,570
Bordeaux grower who's there presenting

195
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,329
her wines in the south of China it was

196
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,640
one of my best to get a trip there I was

197
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:21,960
watching so it's worth today it's worth

198
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:25,199
2.4 billion dollars but 2020 they

199
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:29,850
expected to be with 21 billion that's a

200
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:33,450
big big market currently they estimate

201
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,160
38 million imported wine drinkers 47

202
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,920
percent of whom bialon and us can be

203
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,540
important later on the French have 40

204
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,360
percent of imported wine market and

205
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:46,230
Bordeaux dominates that you have the

206
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,300
lion's share to see if it's for those

207
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,910
number one volume and value market today

208
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,760
and I put in Hong Kong because it's

209
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:57,060
important to understand because we won't

210
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,550
really get into today but one one issue

211
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:03,750
is the smuggling between Hong Kong and

212
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:05,969
Mainland China and that is because 2008

213
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,220
they dropped the import duties on wine

214
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,830
so all the expensive one goes through

215
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,380
Hong Kong okay so like 10 million

216
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,720
bottles but it's worth almost the same

217
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,490
amount as the mainland trade and that's

218
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,740
because it's not because Hong Kong is

219
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:24,570
drinking so much wine it's just it's a

220
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:30,170
platform for mostly illegally getting it

221
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:32,640
into me not China okay let's see here oh

222
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,310
this is the other reason internet

223
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,939
internet is the way to move beyond the

224
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:42,060
first tier cities okay the you know

225
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,260
Shanghai Beijing they're saturated if

226
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,609
you want to if you wanted to get into

227
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,710
the Chinese market today with wine

228
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:50,640
you've got to move beyond there and the

229
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:53,640
Internet is obviously a way to do it you

230
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,560
guys all know Tamar this is this is not

231
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,330
new for you right okay

232
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,760
one thing they've done this this is the

233
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,980
second edition of their global wine and

234
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,160
spirits festival I think maybe you know

235
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,010
that they have a 1111

236
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,790
eleven festival is huge okay you

237
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:13,250
shopping best well they have a wine one

238
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:16,520
now since on September night and then

239
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,080
they just had the second year the second

240
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,569
addition of it I don't have the figures

241
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,730
yet I'm writing a story about it but

242
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,340
they haven't released the data but last

243
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:28,100
year in five minutes they sold more than

244
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:36,560
the entire country of Italy sold in five

245
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:38,780
days this is a big big event and reason

246
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,630
the other reason this is so important is

247
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:46,670
because of the social nature of

248
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:49,430
e-commerce in China it's a way for the

249
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:53,630
wine growers to reach consumers to

250
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:56,000
interact with them they they can its

251
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,890
brand building and education because

252
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,660
it's where the Chinese consumers go to

253
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:07,699
learn about one okay but now the

254
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:10,969
downside we have one this is from a wine

255
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:13,610
fair okay this is out in the open this

256
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:16,250
is typical you see this all the time so

257
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:19,250
this should be Chateau Latour it's shut

258
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,270
child a tour and just because I guess

259
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,760
they thought it made them look better

260
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:30,620
they also put the base shovel symbol

261
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:32,780
down here in 2015 there was a Foreign

262
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,870
Trade Commission released a report that

263
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:38,689
was originally suppressed that found

264
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,000
that confirmed where the experts have

265
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,700
been saying already that counterfeiting

266
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,340
had reached an industrial level it was

267
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,440
very specialized there was a great deal

268
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,220
of expertise fakes we're getting better

269
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,760
and better and better so bottling lines

270
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,830
and and this is on this this is the

271
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,290
figure that caused people to get really

272
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:02,360
upset is that they believe that for

273
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,849
every bottle of authentic French wine

274
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,610
there's at least one bottle of fake in

275
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,090
the market okay this serious serious

276
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,090
problem

277
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,980
one thing that's happened is that and

278
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,100
this happens to Chinese

279
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:23,510
my producers as well their distributor

280
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:27,170
partner can sometimes be the counterfeit

281
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:29,569
earth so for instance I was meeting with

282
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,270
a Chinese wine producer in middle of

283
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:34,760
China and he was explained to me how

284
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,890
this is an example he sells a hundred

285
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,140
cases to a sub distributor who then

286
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:42,680
sells 300 because he's counterfeited

287
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:46,520
another 200 okay the same thing was

288
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:49,400
happening to the French selling wine to

289
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,540
China they had no idea no idea they

290
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,610
thought they'd signed a deal with the

291
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,530
distributor they didn't understand that

292
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,250
they were that distributor was trading

293
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:59,569
around and counterfeiting their wine

294
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,950
so let's would real shake up in the

295
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,250
market and people are trying to find

296
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:06,680
better safer relationships and in it and

297
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:11,360
that's happening there's many many very

298
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:13,160
reliable distributors brands squatting

299
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,150
does everybody know what brands squat

300
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:22,069
eNOS okay okay that's been a big big

301
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:23,840
issue for Bordeaux okay if everyone

302
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:27,640
knows what it is that I'm just going to

303
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,640
talk about one of the more famous cases

304
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,939
first of what happened was the internet

305
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,130
was a big part that was everybody

306
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:38,060
suddenly was getting on the internet

307
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:40,189
this is this is a decade ago but because

308
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,959
every wine grower even though they're

309
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,900
not selling the wine themselves are

310
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,250
using an intermediary it felt like they

311
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,140
needed to have this presence on the

312
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:51,200
internet to reach customers

313
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:55,069
okay well the brand squatters use that

314
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:58,310
as their hunting ground so people didn't

315
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,060
realize even before there I was going to

316
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,650
China

317
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:08,180
someone was was registering their brand

318
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:12,980
okay this guy right here is really Huard

319
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:17,839
remarkable ok mr. Lee he is the owner at

320
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:21,590
pennant Panetti wine and in 2000 he

321
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,870
managed to register his CV which is the

322
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:26,270
Mandarin transliteration for Castel

323
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,449
Castel is when it fast his biggest wine

324
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:34,790
producers okay huge and they're in

325
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:38,689
many many countries because there was

326
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:41,059
the assumption that a French name might

327
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:42,799
be difficult for a Chinese person to

328
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:44,689
pronounce or to understand them to read

329
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,749
they always have Mandarin

330
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:50,629
transliteration of their name okay sushi

331
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:54,859
on the back label well this guy was very

332
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:59,269
clever so he he registered the Mandarin

333
00:15:54,859 --> 00:16:03,079
transliterations years of lawsuits yeah

334
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:05,379
he he held the the name brand for it

335
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,549
he wanted to ransom of million euros

336
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:09,559
Castel said forget it

337
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,389
you know who is this two-bit traitor you

338
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:12,169
know holding us hostage you know we're

339
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:15,529
Castell

340
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:18,829
years of lawsuits they lost each time

341
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:21,019
they lost and they were ordered to pay

342
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:24,019
five million of the largest IP

343
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:25,939
settlements in China and it was read

344
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:29,600
this year they managed to get it reduced

345
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:31,849
but it's still a still a big a big fine

346
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,989
they did he did the same thing to

347
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:38,059
pencils and then food although big oh

348
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:40,039
sorry Peck shouldn't same kind of regard

349
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:42,999
State Treasury wanted states they won

350
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,999
just earlier this year

351
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:50,239
okay alibaba's B Bayside everybody knows

352
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,519
it is it's a real problem for the wine

353
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:55,609
business it's where you go if you want

354
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:59,049
to buy empty bottles fake bottles fake

355
00:16:55,609 --> 00:17:02,419
wine it's a it's a real problem

356
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:04,069
apparently recently I know this summer

357
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:07,099
they've said that they have a new system

358
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:08,750
in place and I've heard from Italian

359
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:11,299
wine makers that they have had good

360
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:15,019
results with with Alibaba pulling down

361
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:17,319
the sights of counterfeiters but I've

362
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:21,319
also heard from other regions that

363
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:23,569
Alibaba was not very responsive so I

364
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:27,740
won't put it up there so the way forward

365
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:29,330
make it complicated menus Bordeaux is an

366
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,169
example because they've really been the

367
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:35,600
leaders in dealing with this issue

368
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:37,760
there's a lot of low tech options that

369
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,649
they use so they work with customs and

370
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,340
bring customs officials here to train

371
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:44,090
them

372
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,860
they go to China and and train them as

373
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,990
well

374
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,870
they have investigators and recover

375
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:56,350
investigators so since 2010

376
00:17:50,870 --> 00:18:01,090
they've taken 3100 samples in 27 cities

377
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:04,668
and all over the country and they had

378
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:06,379
1600 suspicious suspicious bottles so

379
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:10,279
it's pretty that's pretty good that's

380
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,559
pretty good and the it's the wine some

381
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:16,250
wine council that's doing this this is

382
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,629
called the CI baby and it's that really

383
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,419
their job I mean they've had they've

384
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,429
they've been given this job but it's not

385
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:24,350
what they were doing before they didn't

386
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:26,059
have any didn't have a lot of experience

387
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:29,090
in it because they've never had to deal

388
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:31,820
with such a big big problem but it's

389
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:35,120
given ideas since 2004 they've launched

390
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:38,059
240 lawsuits in 28 countries and I wrote

391
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,889
down Naga Valley there because poor Napa

392
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:42,080
Valley has not had such good luck

393
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:47,570
now the valley if you drive through

394
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,820
penglai in eastern on the eastern coast

395
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,710
of China in a wine growing region there

396
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:56,960
the scene is big science on the freeway

397
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:58,580
napa valley and it's all you know it's

398
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,090
registered napa valley can't do anything

399
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,760
about it

400
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:04,629
it's they've tried they've tried to

401
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,129
reason with the local government and

402
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:11,779
it's not they're not gonna get anywhere

403
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:14,690
that same local government in the in

404
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:16,640
here leaders of this of this battle met

405
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:19,070
with a representative bordeaux wine

406
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,320
council and could understand why they

407
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,450
couldn't call penglai the bordeaux of

408
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,720
china they could understand why they

409
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:28,490
couldn't use the word bordeaux in their

410
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,090
in their own publicity in their own

411
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:34,070
region they did not have notion of a

412
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:38,029
geographic indication that was the

413
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,980
biggest thing okay so one of the most

414
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:42,649
important things that that wine trade

415
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,830
has done or now is done is it got their

416
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:47,719
geographic indication recognized in

417
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:51,710
China okay so now they have a legal

418
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:53,149
means pursuing counterfeiters or misuse

419
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,629
of the Bordeaux half

420
00:19:53,149 --> 00:20:02,379
legends okay so here we are there's

421
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:02,379
there's Chinese customs destroying figs

422
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,809
so here these are the high tech options

423
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:10,609
that they're using and it's a

424
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:12,889
combination of all of these things I

425
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:15,139
don't think I'm sure you probably all

426
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:21,109
know these things I don't need to

427
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:22,820
explain it too much to be all nah okay

428
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:27,439
we're gonna go move we will go to bubble

429
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:32,210
tags actually to go to all of them just

430
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:36,320
I want to touch quickly on labels some

431
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:39,499
growers are using our special paper like

432
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,168
when when stocks are printed on it's

433
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:44,719
just a Samedi when you print currency so

434
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:48,109
they've special paper printed us special

435
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:52,639
printers that is very very difficult to

436
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:53,779
it's impossible to fake actually they're

437
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:56,559
doing all kinds of different things with

438
00:20:53,779 --> 00:21:00,019
printing that hidden Holograms they have

439
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,668
the one letter on the name the wine name

440
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:03,799
will be slightly different for different

441
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:06,469
vintages or different wines from your

442
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:07,700
state they try anything they can to make

443
00:21:06,469 --> 00:21:09,619
it as complicated

444
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,839
on the bottle itself you'll find

445
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:14,779
engraving nobody said like a number on

446
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,820
it and if you've really got the money

447
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:19,029
you can have a special mold made for

448
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,309
just for your bottles with the name

449
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:25,159
right in the glass okay but that's

450
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:27,229
that's you only see that at the very

451
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,969
very high end part of the market it's

452
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:31,509
very expensive

453
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:34,460
okay so these QR codes is sort of the

454
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:38,210
ground level you might say that's where

455
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:43,609
everything kind of starts and this is

456
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:46,399
more of a supply chain is it's a supply

457
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:52,689
chain security measure but it does not

458
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:56,599
authenticate the bottle okay let's see

459
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:59,570
so this is okay gs1 which is guys you

460
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:02,809
know just wanted to see how they for me

461
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:05,178
unfortunately of course you do well they

462
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:06,559
are I'm not promoting any of these these

463
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:08,179
companies these are one

464
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,129
to where you do a lot that with the wine

465
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:12,139
trade and that's why I mentioned it but

466
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:13,939
at least you can see how the the QR code

467
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:16,549
works it's obviously it's on the bottle

468
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,169
it's on the box it's on the pallet but

469
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,249
again it doesn't it doesn't mean that

470
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:28,509
what's in that bottle is authentic why

471
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:28,509
it just is track and trace okay yeah

472
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,709
okay the bubble tags these are what's

473
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,110
interesting

474
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,580
so these bubble the bubble formation so

475
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,699
it's like a little constellation is

476
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,860
random and unique each time okay at

477
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,840
first when they first came out everyone

478
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,959
thought they were ugly and put them at

479
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,970
the bottom of the bottle and then they

480
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,100
started wisen up and realizing that in

481
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:54,110
fact if you put it between the capsule

482
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,168
right between the caps on the bottle it

483
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,100
also becomes a tamper proof label right

484
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:03,830
if it's broken

485
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:07,428
you know the bottles been opened so

486
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:09,168
proof tag proof tag and attr are kind of

487
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,580
the big players in that in terms of the

488
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:15,499
wine business they all work within

489
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:17,559
different industries and you can see how

490
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:20,629
they've got the QR code too and it's

491
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:25,908
what we see more and more is each little

492
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:27,969
label uses multiple technologies okay a

493
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:30,590
good example is the crew blue schhwaff

494
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,529
it's important because it represents 30

495
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:37,519
million bottles of wine a year okay all

496
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:40,009
of their wines have to have this code

497
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:43,220
they have to have it and it started

498
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:45,999
originally not for it wasn't meant as a

499
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:49,340
security measure it was a way to

500
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:51,710
internally control the volume of wine

501
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,799
that each producer was labeling couche

502
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:57,679
law okay because they're there every

503
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,749
year they're allowed to they submit a

504
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,129
sample as for a certain volume of wine

505
00:23:59,749 --> 00:24:05,509
and it's accorded it earns the label

506
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:07,850
cuckoo schwa okay

507
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:09,919
so they can't have thought they only

508
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:13,699
have a thousand thousand files like 1000

509
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,879
labels in mm but in turn in fact it's

510
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:19,960
ended up becoming really important

511
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:21,969
really really important really are this

512
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,450
looks like so it becomes a tamper-proof

513
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,770
label as well because once it's once

514
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,020
it's broken you know the models been

515
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:36,790
opened and it connects with the

516
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:41,740
smartphone's weight and so they also put

517
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:43,210
also gives them direct contact not not

518
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,150
direct comment there's a contact with

519
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,560
the consumer excuse where you scan it it

520
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,730
takes you right to their website where

521
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,889
you can put in the little code to see if

522
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,940
it's a real bottle right but it also -

523
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,830
right there you get to learn all about

524
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:57,070
the chateaus to learn all about the

525
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:58,929
wines so it's it's really important I

526
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,340
think to understand that the wine

527
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:04,870
business is also using this for

528
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:06,459
marketing so this is shuttle Margo this

529
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:10,350
is what they do as you can see there

530
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:14,770
little label you can see the little

531
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:17,139
little code and the edge number okay so

532
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:19,840
obviously each number is obviously the

533
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:24,460
alphanumeric code is unique to that ball

534
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:26,740
okay and as in most cases very few

535
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,420
people have all of the information at

536
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,330
the company it's all held privately

537
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,700
within the company and there's just not

538
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,780
even a handful of people who have access

539
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,870
to information

540
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:41,139
it's that closely guarded and in fact

541
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,699
when I talk to producers about working

542
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,730
with customs and sharing information

543
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:49,000
with customs customs organizations they

544
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:50,500
kind of laugh like no I don't think so I

545
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,770
think we'll keep that information very

546
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,710
very private this is one of the this is

547
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:59,860
what AT&T is doing with champagne and I

548
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:02,280
I think it's kind of interesting because

549
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:07,810
they you can see that they're using

550
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:09,940
different technology I'm going to go to

551
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:13,169
this holographic zappy which i think is

552
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,170
is pretty cool

553
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,259
so on one level you're dealing with

554
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,230
agents in the field okay you're doing

555
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:27,109
its supply chain management okay

556
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:31,129
security you're dealing the QR code

557
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:33,080
you're it's your marketing right as well

558
00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:35,539
as as well as track and trace and the

559
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,918
holographic stamp is for forensic

560
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:41,090
expertise let's see that there it is

561
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:43,999
this is something new that they're doing

562
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:49,309
I think we'll see a lot more of this

563
00:26:43,999 --> 00:26:58,850
kind of thing and basically they just

564
00:26:49,309 --> 00:27:01,070
keep improving on the technology test

565
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,649
escribió send it to you I work with them

566
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,830
they have they work a lot with the the

567
00:27:03,649 --> 00:27:09,340
wine business castel is one of their big

568
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:12,109
customers for though Bordeaux superior

569
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,820
so here's what castile is doing in China

570
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:16,970
so that same company that is dealing

571
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:20,269
with the brown squatter they this is

572
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:23,239
what this is their answer to China so

573
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:26,720
you scan it you put in your code you're

574
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:28,639
also giving them information obviously

575
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:34,340
opens up this its marketing

576
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:37,309
possibilities but it can also then it it

577
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:40,720
works with a smartphone but they decide

578
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:43,039
against an app because they felt like it

579
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,259
they could potentially lose customers

580
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,080
but it works with WeChat and China

581
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:50,960
because we Chad has a QR scanner in it

582
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,269
so people can actually use WeChat they

583
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,119
scan it it links directly to the

584
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:59,210
security site for castel they can take a

585
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:01,939
photo and send them send the photo of

586
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:04,580
the dodgy bottle to castile and it's

587
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:08,149
linked to Google Maps so if they get in

588
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,189
reports of enough suspicious bottles in

589
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:14,238
one area they sent in an investigator so

590
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:16,369
it's really been really really important

591
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:22,659
I think evolution and how they're using

592
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:27,470
this technology to track down Thanks so

593
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:30,200
obviously on these in these these tags

594
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,880
on these labels you can see some of the

595
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,440
technology you can't in the rest of it

596
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,630
you can't see they don't it's not all

597
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,370
obvious there's a need code in the

598
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:41,840
shimmer it's not a static hologram

599
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:43,580
that's something they started doing it

600
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,050
the consumer doesn't see everything but

601
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,179
they can't connect with it and they can

602
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:49,399
get the marketing information they can

603
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:58,940
get all kinds of it about the wine if it

604
00:28:49,400 --> 00:29:01,040
interests them and this is appear the

605
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:04,610
things they do like these labels one

606
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,899
from competition by competition and

607
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:09,199
they're doing special ones that can't be

608
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:11,590
faked although again every time they say

609
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,450
they can't be faked the counterfeiters

610
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,980
usually figure out a way to start doing

611
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:20,090
something very similar so it's

612
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:24,620
constantly constantly evolving marketing

613
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:27,820
applications ok the NFC chip behind the

614
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:30,649
wine label that's been important

615
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:34,939
important evolution it's still very

616
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:37,250
costly so they're relatively few bottles

617
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:40,210
are going to be equipped with it but it

618
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,860
is interesting it is what's new and

619
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:45,170
including the capsule seal with these

620
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:50,419
little antennas and if you see if you've

621
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:52,010
broken the seal the antenna is it's able

622
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,650
to notify you that the bottle has been

623
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,390
opened ok which I think that's pretty

624
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:58,340
cool but again I imagine fairly

625
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:04,130
expensive but I think that's I think

626
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:06,409
that's pretty interesting here this is

627
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:07,760
the NFC this is a good example of it

628
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:12,410
that's being used in the in the wine

629
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,300
business and here's where they're

630
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,810
checking to see whether the capsule has

631
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:19,700
been whether it's been broken and then

632
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:28,520
we basically refilled is what they're

633
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:32,960
protecting against and that's it did I

634
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:35,110
do it in 30 minutes ok do you have

635
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,110
questions

636
00:30:53,740 --> 00:31:00,830
yes yes it depends the NFC is because

637
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:03,260
you need this the smartphone is really

638
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:06,290
more for consumers but yeah people look

639
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:09,320
for retailers sales staff anyway anyone

640
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:13,210
along the supply chain could use it I'm

641
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:16,370
told that the RFID is used more for

642
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,050
professionals it needs a reader so

643
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:21,800
that's so it's not really meant for

644
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:24,440
somebody for consumers but the NFC is

645
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:28,730
definite but in general it depends what

646
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:31,430
country you're in but obviously in China

647
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:51,230
or the states most sales staff has got a

648
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:53,390
smartphone I assume at some level you

649
00:31:51,230 --> 00:32:06,860
can put all the QR codes and other codes

650
00:31:53,390 --> 00:32:09,080
on you have to you're absolutely right

651
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:13,159
none of it works if the consumers and

652
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,300
the buyers to retailers aren't don't

653
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,610
know what's going on they don't know

654
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:20,180
what it is obviously Bordeaux has a

655
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:24,709
really really active wine school that

656
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:27,830
trains hundreds proxy thousands of a

657
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:30,160
year in China alone professionals wine

658
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:34,580
trade professionals as well as consumers

659
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:36,260
they have advertising campaigns all over

660
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,020
the world but in certain markets they

661
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,940
have priority China's a big priority so

662
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,590
that's how they do it but they also

663
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,460
these literally out are on the ground

664
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:47,000
going and needy people talking to

665
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:49,890
people that all the big trade shows

666
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,720
constantly communicating about how to

667
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:56,640
authenticate a wines I think you were

668
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,470
saying it was there we love we're here

669
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,380
to say about somebody doing it hundred

670
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:04,650
thousand bottles of cheap - a little bit

671
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:12,810
less cheap versus a very high-end bottle

672
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:14,820
and look what is it well the first year

673
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,500
always worried about our health and

674
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:20,250
hygiene issues you're always worried

675
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:24,270
about someone putting something bad okay

676
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:27,780
luckily that happens very rarely in

677
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:29,190
Europe okay or the states it happens

678
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:32,100
more that happens actually more in the

679
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:35,190
hard liquor business okay in the wine

680
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:38,100
business not too often in China however

681
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:40,230
or another other difficult markets not

682
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,600
just China you can find all kinds of

683
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,190
things in there colorants nasty things

684
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,719
and that's usually when the Chinese

685
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,120
actually stepped in because they're very

686
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,690
very care something they're careful

687
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,250
about health and hygiene but they do

688
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,230
take that very very seriously as a crime

689
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,660
so you're much more likely to get

690
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,850
Chinese officials cracking down on

691
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:03,090
counterfeit ER if that counterfeiter is

692
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,649
putting bad things into the ball that's

693
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:10,860
what everybody always worries about the

694
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:14,280
most after that I think that it's it's

695
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:16,320
the it's actually the the volume the

696
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,720
valley encounter fairs because they're

697
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,390
attacking when they attack Bordeaux for

698
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,859
instance right or it could be a burgundy

699
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:25,170
or champagne whatever it is cognac

700
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:27,780
they're attacking the whole region right

701
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:30,889
and they're not only they effectively

702
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:34,320
taking a sail away from you but they're

703
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:35,839
if the consumer drinks that right and

704
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,100
it's it's bad

705
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,830
is that consumer gonna buy that your

706
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:43,560
product again a real product now so it's

707
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:45,929
really bad for for business is bad for

708
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:50,009
our reputation is bad for our brand and

709
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:52,949
Bordeaux is a 3.7 billion your business

710
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:55,110
okay it's between 600 and 700 million

711
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:57,220
bottles a year it's a big business with

712
00:34:55,110 --> 00:35:00,670
lots of little growers about so

713
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:04,060
thousand growers 300 merchants it's kind

714
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:42,880
of peculiar business but it's supports a

715
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:48,009
lot of people and someone know someone

716
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,950
do still work there you know it's funny

717
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:53,020
when the first wine crime stories I

718
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:55,990
covers when I was a reporter for the

719
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:58,119
French News Service AFP and it was the

720
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:00,490
18 million bottles of faint Pinot Noir

721
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:01,690
and I arrived I told my editors like I

722
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:03,459
think I put her head down there's this

723
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,020
case going to trial I really think I

724
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,670
should be there and like okay fine so I

725
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,589
went down there and they're all these

726
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,150
French reporters around my in the

727
00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:13,089
country grout when I was doing they're

728
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:14,950
like why is this American coming here to

729
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:17,589
cover the story me it's just just like

730
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:19,359
fake wine story what's the big deal and

731
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:21,369
of course it turned out to be this huge

732
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,770
story went all over the world it was

733
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:26,020
just an enormous story

734
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:29,259
but there is there is this sort of like

735
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:31,630
wink wink nod nod attitude a little bit

736
00:36:29,260 --> 00:37:03,430
about I find that's just my personal

737
00:36:31,630 --> 00:37:07,980
opinion it's not seriously here lies the

738
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:28,560
case signals it will be to be over

739
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:35,520
I mean how do we deal with all the

740
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:42,810
people creating all this case so you get

741
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:46,680
six URLs and say then you basically Gy

742
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:48,750
we label everything those same six label

743
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,790
life can be through every nursery in

744
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,560
China that one said here's your own

745
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,240
unique age every single bottle is unique

746
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,580
every label is valid if you look it up

747
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,770
on the table it says yet new wallpaper

748
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:01,859
thing even though it's gonna fit that

749
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:08,700
have another scoping game come here how

750
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:10,410
does this vary it there is the actual

751
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:31,230
art cases of where the counterfeiters

752
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:33,890
are created websites I'm sure the same I

753
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:36,869
know like this investigator that he

754
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:39,330
talked to me about going into label fact

755
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:40,800
label factories where their girl label

756
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,869
printers and they're right there

757
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,700
printing you know not just for wine but

758
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:46,680
for clothing the making labels of cats

759
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,470
what they do but they are printing the

760
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,540
the fakes as well for the fakes as well

761
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:53,700
as the legitimate factories it's right

762
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,920
there the same business so you're right

763
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,330
noticed an enormous problem I think that

764
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,950
I think is what Alan said actually it's

765
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,960
communication we have to just keep

766
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:04,350
communicating but the problem is on

767
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,970
places like you know tap out is if they

768
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,440
don't take down those sites when they're

769
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:09,330
identified and of course they just pop

770
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,430
up again under another name

771
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:13,770
right I mean it's it's relentless I

772
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:16,020
don't know if the wine industry these do

773
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:19,880
have sort of cyber detectives out there

774
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,880
working on this all the time

775
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:26,640
just they don't have to taste the wine

776
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,440
right part of the problem there is that

777
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,720
from a business culture perspective you

778
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,089
can't do trust but verify where China's

779
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,919
concerned it has to be all verify

780
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:41,980
because it's culturally acceptable to

781
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,839
substitute and screw and you know it's

782
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,780
perfectly buying for a factory running

783
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:50,078
off labels too as soon as the guy from

784
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:53,020
the legit customer leaves run off a

785
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,599
couple thousand extra for their other

786
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,490
customers well in the counter pairs

787
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,280
aren't just attacking international

788
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,868
brands they attack Chinese brands and a

789
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,760
lot of these Chinese brands are owned by

790
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:08,619
the government you know the the

791
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,119
counterfeiters attack them as well well

792
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:13,450
they get into trouble if there's a

793
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,250
health and hygiene issue yeah not too

794
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,930
much recently apparently they're

795
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:19,300
starting to crack down a little bit more

796
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,910
but no I mean there's so many stories

797
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,680
that the you know the running like a

798
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:26,379
bottling line on an abandoned chicken

799
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:36,940
farm or something and not a lot happens

800
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:40,690
to them no hungry you know it's pretty

801
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:43,270
me have to give another three years they

802
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:45,460
become equally silly as we are forget

803
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:52,240
around sort of wanting brands for the

804
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:53,619
sake of the brand rather than product no

805
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,910
I think that that's actually I think

806
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:57,579
that that's a really good point when

807
00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:01,450
when China opened up just to give you an

808
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:03,609
example there was only a few thousand

809
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:07,390
bottles of Bordeaux going into to China

810
00:41:03,609 --> 00:41:11,348
look what it is today okay it was just

811
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:13,930
it was just a huge rocks and and at that

812
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:15,250
time that the average annual income I

813
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,770
think was one hundred eighty seven

814
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:20,430
dollars yeah I mean there was no market

815
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:22,960
Noma had nothing absolutely nothing and

816
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:25,450
it's gonna take a little while but I

817
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,040
think that that's gonna really push the

818
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,899
Chinese government is it now they're

819
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,359
exporting wine okay

820
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,160
they want their wine protected here and

821
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,509
they want China

822
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:37,089
wanted to be something to be proud of

823
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:38,230
okay they want to stand for something

824
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:40,270
that means we're gonna have to be sure

825
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,369
that when we buy Chinese wine that it is

826
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:44,829
what it says on the label is what's in

827
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:48,329
the bottle right so I think that that's

828
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:48,329
what's going to raise the standards

829
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,519
[Music]

830
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,619
[Music]

831
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:14,079
factory where they make the religious

832
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:17,309
stuff how do you determine you thinking

833
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,309
about you mean in France when it's

834
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:22,140
manufactured

835
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:29,440
[Music]

836
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:31,900
sambata that way okay in France its

837
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,839
heavily heavily regulated they have

838
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,579
these registers in everything you comes

839
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:38,170
in and out of that cellar any kind of

840
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:40,779
product is goes into these register and

841
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:43,270
they're audited regularly okay and

842
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:47,170
they're very these inspectors are really

843
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:49,180
good at following the trail how much

844
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,680
wine came in at one con and how much

845
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:53,819
we're not looking at false looking for

846
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:57,759
false paperwork they're very very good

847
00:42:53,819 --> 00:43:00,660
so France is actually pretty good but

848
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,059
because of their ridiculous comedy

849
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,589
system and and paperwork they're

850
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:09,039
actually pretty good their countries

851
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:11,288
were that doesn't exist which yeah I'm

852
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:20,380
sure that there's a lot of creative

853
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:22,539
blending which was legal not that long

854
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:25,450
ago I mean we forget that but it was I

855
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:27,430
mean it why isn't uncommon in the in

856
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:30,189
their early 20th century to take wines

857
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:35,109
from warmer climates like North Africa

858
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:37,539
and blend it with French wines okay yeah

859
00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:39,848
did make it a little fruity er okay that

860
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:44,039
wasn't illegal that wasn't illegal that

861
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:45,849
was common just ours our notion of

862
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:48,099
origin has changed

863
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:51,549
and it's become very very important to

864
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:53,229
protect our geographic indications I was

865
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:56,309
leaving one last thing a friend of my as

866
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:59,919
a historian I did put it up here because

867
00:43:56,309 --> 00:44:02,289
because he hasn't published yet I just

868
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,019
didn't want to I didn't feel comfortable

869
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:06,069
posting it but he sent me my emails told

870
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:09,098
me what I was talking about he's his

871
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:13,390
great wine historian and he sent me a

872
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:15,729
recipe for a first group from the 1700s

873
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,848
and all the things that went into it

874
00:44:15,729 --> 00:44:22,538
different wines to create this perfect

875
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:24,640
the perfect the it was a first grade

876
00:44:22,539 --> 00:44:29,140
Bordeaux first growth but and this was a

877
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:31,479
very very respectable wine merchant so I

878
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:36,368
mean we are our notions of what fake

879
00:44:31,479 --> 00:44:39,419
wine is has changed a lot okay yeah

880
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:39,420
questions I think we're

881
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,749
[Applause]
