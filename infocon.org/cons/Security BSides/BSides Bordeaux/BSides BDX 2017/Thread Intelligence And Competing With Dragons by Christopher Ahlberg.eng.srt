1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,480
the cool yeah so I'm Christopher

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,460
albergue co-founder and CEO of recorded

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,590
future I'm going to talk about threat

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,000
intelligence and I realized that there's

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,590
a few people in the room would probably

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,840
know more about threat intelligence than

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,890
I do but that's okay and I'm maybe

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,690
there's some people who've never heard

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,369
of spread Intel and we'll sort of think

10
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,720
about how with your British tells - I'm

11
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:25,940
gonna put that in the context of

12
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,609
speaking about dragons but which implies

13
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,789
China here so well hopefully you'll

14
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:33,890
enjoy that and it's quickly about myself

15
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:35,960
I'm Swedish my background but live in

16
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,379
the US since a long time we heard that

17
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,379
on my voice

18
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:43,699
soldier I wrote a PhD thesis on how to

19
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,379
visualize large databases I ran a

20
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:47,809
company called Spotfire for a long time

21
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,849
that came out of my my background there

22
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:51,919
some sort of a data visualization guy

23
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,389
more than a security guy but I guess

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,739
over the last five years I've sort of

25
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:59,139
become a security guy

26
00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:01,428
I don't know I like French wine and

27
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:06,020
anybody see anything wrong in that last

28
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:07,400
picture I was hoping for you guys to

29
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:18,110
throw tomatoes at me because that was

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:20,270
burgundy wine but so what is threat

31
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,450
intelligence so the cool thing I got a

32
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,190
new calling here in France yeah you know

33
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,080
this is our first record future

34
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:29,470
colleague in France so that's exciting

35
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,520
so I sent him an email and I said hey

36
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,590
tell me how do I say it's rich

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,089
intelligence in France and you know the

38
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,990
answer I get sort of the classic

39
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:41,570
friendships it's a completely I asked

40
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:43,490
one of my board members who is Bernard

41
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,440
Lee Abdul he ran a company called

42
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:48,770
Business Objects is all that choice ap

43
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,539
very famous French software guy and he

44
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,280
just did this when I asked him I know I

45
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,500
was for him it was trying to say

46
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,440
business intelligence in French it was

47
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:01,520
sort of complicated so so I think we're

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,860
just gonna stick with threat

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,158
intelligence come tell me afterwards if

50
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:11,359
you have a better word and sort of the

51
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:13,670
good side yeah and so I'll do a few Game

52
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:15,770
of Thrones analogies so I don't know is

53
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,890
it popular in France

54
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,110
so so so one way to think about threat

55
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,049
intelligence is sort of use the wall

56
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:31,070
analogy now coming out of America when

57
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:33,770
you speak about a wall put that aside so

58
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:35,750
I think of threat intelligence as being

59
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,060
if you think in security and we have a

60
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,250
company or an organization would what

61
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,990
have you they have a perimeter and you

62
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,810
know that's the wall and the role of

63
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,720
threat intelligence to sort of dare to

64
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,940
look beyond that wall and try to collect

65
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,190
a little bit of intelligence that we

66
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,770
could actually use and defending them

67
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,200
now typically there's not a lot of

68
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,320
people doing that it's pretty lonely I

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,290
had to do it we we just ran our user

70
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,630
conference in DC where we actually had

71
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,340
250 people are so who are now sort of

72
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,990
doing threat intelligence and that was

73
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,270
very exciting but you know there's like

74
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:14,030
two guys from one company three guys

75
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,850
from another you know so it's it's still

76
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,620
it lonely it's a new profession and so

77
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:21,019
on and then when you go out there and

78
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,700
you go look and venture into the Russian

79
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,160
underground or what have you that's

80
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,660
lonely so you know but ultimately what

81
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:34,970
you're trying to do is you know you want

82
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:38,120
to be Boris but if you want to be virus

83
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,250
and so did the guy my little birds tell

84
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,930
me everything and you know you want to

85
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,390
be that guy who sort of collect

86
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,880
information and pull it all together and

87
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,220
and you know I like to use the military

88
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,900
word is sort of all source intelligence

89
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,720
you want to get all kinds of

90
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,340
intelligence you know whether it come

91
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,410
back to that but you want to get all

92
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,990
kinds of intelligence being open sources

93
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,730
or dark sources or technical sources and

94
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,340
pull that together in a way that you can

95
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:07,609
actually put it your work so that's the

96
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,100
end of the game of Thrones stuff but you

97
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:12,230
want to be bars so keep that in mind all

98
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,690
right so today I'll speak about

99
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,909
nation-states stuff you know when we

100
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,589
think about tracking lore

101
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,840
you know spread after is a various

102
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:22,849
thought of thought was a kinds we could

103
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:24,619
think about hacktivist we could think

104
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,350
about just hackers you know fooling

105
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,759
around do you think about criminals and

106
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,639
there's plenty of criminals in

107
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,870
wherever you are Russia over there in

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,430
any of every country but it will always

109
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,439
think about Russian on the ground gonna

110
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,029
be the scammers have all kinds of

111
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,009
stories today we'll think about

112
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,169
nation-states and and you know this

113
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,520
could be either five I guys it could be

114
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:47,520
these really is some Swedish my

115
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,308
background it could be the Fri guys the

116
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,650
Russians the Chinese the French you know

117
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:54,749
even the French they do this stuff in

118
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,758
fact it's become such that I think it's

119
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:58,259
fair to say that when intelligence

120
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,990
services want to collect information

121
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,879
even the classically oriented human

122
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,830
places that people who have spies you

123
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,409
know like good old spying sort of

124
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,748
approaches even they're doing things via

125
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:11,729
computers has become the primary means

126
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:14,580
of collection or or at least one of them

127
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,969
so today we'll sort of focus in on these

128
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,930
guys

129
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:21,210
the Chinese MSS which is their CIA if

130
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,069
you want it's a little bit different and

131
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,960
we'll talk about that but they're in

132
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:28,919
there some sort of interesting angles to

133
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,888
it so the the trick to understanding

134
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,270
government agencies I believe is to not

135
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,759
just think about them as a bunch of

136
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,709
hackers because they're not they're

137
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,330
different you know it's a hacker might

138
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:42,180
wake up in the morning say today I'm

139
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,680
gonna go scam you know Apple look try to

140
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,909
get some money for them or I'm gonna go

141
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,490
hack this website

142
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:49,379
he may have might have a boss and he

143
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,209
might have you know look but but in

144
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,879
reality there's not a lot of bureaucracy

145
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:55,889
or run around this hacker if you

146
00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:03,270
thinking about well come you get to do

147
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:05,610
push-ups the the specific thing about

148
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,008
government agencies is that they haven't

149
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,469
asked it so somebody tells them what to

150
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:13,139
do they were but yet they got a time

151
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:15,748
schedule they may have very long time

152
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,789
horizons they may be told to get into

153
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:19,589
something and even if it takes a year to

154
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:21,990
get to it so there are a lot of things

155
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:24,059
that become specific if you think about

156
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:26,520
a government agency so here you know

157
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:29,189
China is easing this aging ping he says

158
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,149
mister G here repeats China's pledge to

159
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:33,479
promote equitable

160
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:35,639
global Internet Governance sort of big

161
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,949
centers while upholding summer

162
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,599
sovereignty or the right of countries to

163
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:41,250
determine how they want to manage the

164
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,998
Internet this will be very important

165
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,009
sentence and

166
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:45,419
and won't expect you to remember all

167
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:51,569
these words but I will actually ties

168
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:54,899
back like the other and we're gonna see

169
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:57,299
how it gets complicated so then when he

170
00:06:54,899 --> 00:07:01,649
says that that means said for example

171
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:03,419
MSS gets put to work Emma says very

172
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:05,159
important thing for him and we can talk

173
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,308
about that at length but then eventually

174
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:09,629
the MSS guys will task very sort of

175
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:11,369
groups and there might be people who

176
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:13,469
work in their building where people

177
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:16,319
working on the street now this

178
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:18,239
intelligence is in all countries do that

179
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,339
sometimes they do the work themselves so

180
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:21,989
they put others to work that was in

181
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,999
Sweden or in France or you know like

182
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:25,619
there's nothing funky but you know maybe

183
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:27,119
an information security the more of that

184
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:29,069
you know you'll send something to work

185
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:32,489
nothing of target somebody whether it's

186
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:35,219
a French you know maybe organization or

187
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:36,989
whoever whoever they might go after now

188
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,969
they're gonna do that trying to take

189
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:40,859
advantage of vulnerabilities and then

190
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:43,529
you know try to use various tool sets

191
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,169
and eventually you know traces behind

192
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:48,089
the reason I always try to make this

193
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,248
point here and maybe for some users is

194
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:51,959
completely wonder-percent obvious but by

195
00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:54,300
understanding this sort of how it all

196
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:56,849
ties together we can sort of understand

197
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,889
that you know when we see some traces on

198
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:00,599
our networks we you know if we can tie

199
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,759
that back to a tool sense that are used

200
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,529
we should be able to sort of either you

201
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,149
know figure out like who's trying to

202
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,189
come after us and if we can figure out

203
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:09,889
who's coming out after us now we can

204
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:12,809
actually use that to not just track

205
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,639
individual you know individual sort of

206
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:15,989
indicators for defense maybe we can

207
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,389
actually say we want to defend against

208
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:19,739
this you know largely against it sort of

209
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,719
tool says we're gonna patch against

210
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:23,518
these holder abilities you can't sort of

211
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:26,429
have a whole different sort of approach

212
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,989
to how we defend ourselves now I'm not

213
00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:30,719
gonna say there are any easy buttons and

214
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:32,308
all of this but let's try to as we go

215
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,669
through this understand the whole chain

216
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:39,328
of things do remember this little quote

217
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:40,799
here so you know I will say very little

218
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:43,049
but about to record future today but I

219
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,240
will say that our job what we do is if

220
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,910
we collect from open sources and close

221
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,550
sources and technical sourcing and try

222
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,410
to organize gob sedae that we run more

223
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,479
or less like a thousand Amazon servers

224
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,160
that large where we collect information

225
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,680
try to organize that be clever ways

226
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,870
using everything for basic statistics to

227
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,888
I guess you know these days everybody

228
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,750
wants to talk about machine learning

229
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,220
some machine learning AI and sort of

230
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,649
techniques and then get that to people

231
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,600
and so that's sort of all I will say but

232
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,699
I'll I'll come back and make a couple of

233
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,060
connections to it but let's with that

234
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:17,010
dive in to to China so and specifically

235
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,719
again and assess and I'll talk about how

236
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,029
this becomes sort of an infinite loop

237
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,459
I'll call it for companies who are

238
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:26,189
trying to do business in China which a

239
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:29,459
lot of people are even ourselves make so

240
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,050
it's tricky business and so the first

241
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,560
sort of point that I will try to make is

242
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:37,170
that many maybe if you've heard of these

243
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,829
guys epic III they're known actor out

244
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,510
there gets to be called Buckeye and

245
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:44,279
gothic Panda you know these people love

246
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:48,060
to get two names on these so that they

247
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:49,560
sound very fancy and well the first sort

248
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,349
of point here I'm gonna try to prove out

249
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,599
to use that apt 3 is the same as Emma

250
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,300
says same as their never again the

251
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,850
Chinese CA now I could probably spend a

252
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,439
whole day on this and so I'll give you

253
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,819
the four and a half minutes sort of

254
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,110
version maybe will be two and a half

255
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:06,180
minute version but we can talk more

256
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,949
about it didn't break I know there's a

257
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,899
few people here who spent probably more

258
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:12,300
on time on this that I have so but is it

259
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:15,149
it's a fun subject so the first sort of

260
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,550
thing to know here is this piece of

261
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,079
malware called p r-- p that apt three

262
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,209
probably has been using for about a

263
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,519
decade and in their various of

264
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,469
operations around the world and you dig

265
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,810
into the domains that have been

266
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,810
registered by that there's you get to

267
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:33,839
this guide on how this is when people

268
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,060
still would usernames on malware

269
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,040
registry or domain registration people

270
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,500
are getting smarter around that and you

271
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,790
know hidings better it turns out that

272
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,319
this guide on how he's the registered

273
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,779
shareholder with one other guy of a

274
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:51,000
company called boy sec boy ii but we

275
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,519
spell it out is going to boy information

276
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,079
technology company so that's sort of

277
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,170
interesting so we started getting a

278
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:00,029
connection from this piece of malware to

279
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,069
this domain registration to this company

280
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,199
boy say what is that

281
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:05,760
we also found open sourcing and in

282
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:07,420
chinese language completely digging

283
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,180
around and open sources we were able

284
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,969
show that boy sack has a joint lab with

285
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,250
this thing called Guangdong IT SEC and

286
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,710
so it turns out that boy SEC is one of

287
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,720
the in Chinese active defense companies

288
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,670
so you know sort of a penetration and

289
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,830
activity offense which would apply this

290
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,979
you know pretty aggressive activities

291
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:31,420
and they had this joint lab would what's

292
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:35,650
called one long IT sack Guangdong IT SEC

293
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:39,010
in turn we also found nice open sources

294
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:44,140
pointee how they advertise themselves to

295
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:47,890
be a field arm in Guangdong for what's

296
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,660
called C CNC and ting sex in tech which

297
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:52,120
is the China information technology

298
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,650
security evaluation centers these are

299
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,810
the guys when if you've heard about hum

300
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,569
for example Microsoft gave their source

301
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,000
code to Chinese MSS for a code

302
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,500
inspection bad thing they should never

303
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,920
have done that but these are the guys

304
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:10,090
who get got their hands on so these guys

305
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,640
are the Gong dong field arm of sin Tech

306
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:15,280
and so now what we then are able to do

307
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,939
is to sort of take the connection from

308
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:22,750
pure B to apt 3 to this company boy

309
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,970
Shack to going on IT sex all the way up

310
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,240
to syntactic now we are in MSS from

311
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,730
their long academic sort of history of

312
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,880
documenting that sin Tech is nothing but

313
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,580
a part of MSS that's up being a pretty

314
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,340
nice sort of connection of things here

315
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:42,220
and it's very classic MSS behavior of

316
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,110
using third parties like this boy suck

317
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,970
as a way for execution which again

318
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,240
intelligence a this is do it all over

319
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,850
the world but it's more so in in you

320
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,160
know in MSS behavior so that's pretty

321
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,640
nice now you say okay we're gonna do

322
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,260
that

323
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,330
that's interesting but alright it's

324
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,430
enough what does that mean for me I

325
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,860
actually do think now talk a little bit

326
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,689
what I think that actually means so

327
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,090
China has just instituted a new

328
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,770
cybersecurity law so that's interesting

329
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,740
you've probably have read about or heard

330
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:13,930
about that over the last year and now

331
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,460
there are many security law surround or

332
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:20,609
cyber security laws around the world in

333
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,250
fact in Europe you know GD RP

334
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,779
coming up as a cybersecurity law and and

335
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,209
you know I think there's to talk about

336
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,490
that this afternoon even so now you know

337
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:31,319
DD RP can be painful especially if you

338
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,670
work in information security calling

339
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,709
kinds of painful than that could

340
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:36,719
probably drive money also like something

341
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:39,029
CBS is on but they're they're painful

342
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,940
aspects to it is on but ultimately it's

343
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:44,610
set up to protect information for you

344
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,010
know us as consumers you know and and

345
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:49,230
you know even to the degree if you know

346
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,990
CW here is sort of dumb things something

347
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,700
stupid ends up in some newspaper but

348
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,680
then he wants to get rid of himself he

349
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,079
could be you know right to be forgotten

350
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,880
and said of course at and and so all

351
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,300
kinds of businesses sort of to protect

352
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,820
consumers now we need to get big into

353
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,529
the Chinese version of the same has some

354
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,360
of the same standardized his collection

355
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:12,029
and use of yeah I personally

356
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,180
identifiable information and so on but

357
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:18,089
though where it gets complicated is that

358
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:21,140
this law is ultimately about Chinese

359
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:24,120
government's access to personable

360
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,829
information or personal information so

361
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,019
quite different you know it's ultimately

362
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:31,589
about them having direct access to

363
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:35,220
source code or data or networks which is

364
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:37,800
important networks as well as being the

365
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,920
ones who take it and take in all the

366
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,569
vulnerability data that is collected so

367
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,670
they get basically all of it and they

368
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:48,000
even set up an informant system around

369
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,620
this so MSS here or I'll go in fact I'll

370
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,290
make this point here then that it's

371
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,019
actually MSS who runs and administers

372
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:57,930
this law in China so now we've

373
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,820
established that MSS is is you know abt

374
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,160
three running sort of offensive cyber

375
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,920
operation but they're also the ones who

376
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,959
are administering running the cyber

377
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,899
security law I guess pretty complicated

378
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,300
and it's also interesting that they

379
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:15,570
actually run the Chinese vulnerability

380
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,029
database called CMM BD so you've

381
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:20,010
probably seen the u.s. it's called miss

382
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:22,260
two runs what's called immediate

383
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,000
national vulnerability database anybody

384
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,610
view here sort of a pen tester of some

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,040
sort of run and seen that in China they

386
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,079
run their CNN BD so we're gonna take a

387
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,420
quick look at that

388
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,930
so obviously MSS could take advantage of

389
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,880
this if

390
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,069
all kinds of things and they that's what

391
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,650
they did with getting their hands on the

392
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,210
yeah Microsoft source code that's why

393
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,939
they've sort of been able to hack every

394
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,550
Tibetan monk nine times over you know

395
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:53,100
taking apart marks office in every way

396
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:55,500
there is and and not so good so this we

397
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:59,060
believe create sort of an infinite loop

398
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,530
and you know I won't try to do the

399
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,270
definition I you know when it's in the

400
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,130
Lupus it's something without them a

401
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,900
clinician could end up in a couple of

402
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,630
different ways but you you end up with

403
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,030
this sort of the same thing here where

404
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,710
under M you know that this is law the

405
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,600
Chinese cyber security law if you do

406
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,450
business in China you're required to

407
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,860
hand over your data or provide access to

408
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:24,420
your data or your networks in China and

409
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,190
even source code and the people you have

410
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,120
to give it to his MSS that we prove it

411
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:32,160
out to be their CIA here and the so you

412
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,130
have to cooperate with all requests for

413
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,050
user data all this sort of stuff but at

414
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:40,380
the same time you want to comply with

415
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:45,300
DDR P in Europe or the equivalent loss

416
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:47,700
in the u.s. you just can't do both so it

417
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,520
gets really complicated it's it's to

418
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,800
satisfy both losses here may even be

419
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,439
impossible I think that's sort of

420
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,060
something that is not being really

421
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,650
understood so far and for people who are

422
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,020
looking to business in China which is

423
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,209
gonna weave and recorded in sure this

424
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,780
gets very complicated so something to

425
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:08,280
keep in mind now question is can we

426
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,369
actually learn something from these guys

427
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,829
so it turns out this is results that we

428
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:16,199
published on Thursday so just two days

429
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,699
48 hours ago I'm sort of excited to be

430
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,380
this is the first conference we're

431
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:22,830
presenting this we put this out on our

432
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:28,010
website on on Thursday so can we use CME

433
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:30,780
here's an idiot util here linen is the

434
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:32,550
connection and it's actually turns out

435
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:36,030
they're they're very efficient at

436
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:38,129
vulnerability data management so we long

437
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,710
studied the u.s. vulnerability

438
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:43,590
management system and seen it to be slow

439
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,170
so it turns out that the USM ad takes

440
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,850
about thirty three days to publish data

441
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:50,730
on a new order

442
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:55,379
sometimes it's fast so for example for

443
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:57,210
the new the Apache structure owner

444
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,530
ability the US government figured out

445
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,060
that that was very important it took

446
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,910
three days to get that out that was

447
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,429
remarkably fast he said their regular 33

448
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,680
for dirty cow and other you know

449
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,030
well-known new vulnerability took the US

450
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,190
government 20 days to get that

451
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:14,639
information out the Chinese did it in

452
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:17,340
two so an average the Chinese do this in

453
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,280
13 days the u.s. takes 33 days

454
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,230
it's a big difference and so as someone

455
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,790
who's doing defense we we would

456
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,490
recommend you should actually look at

457
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:28,379
this data is it's fast and it's actually

458
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,880
then the critique that we would be

459
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,360
published is over the last couple of

460
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,760
days here of course the the nvd guys the

461
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,679
US government they were like yeah but we

462
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,210
have better quality blah blah blah which

463
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,320
of course you know when you're slow

464
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,880
you're gonna claim higher quality but we

465
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,760
actually spend a lot of time looking at

466
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,280
this Chinese data and at large large

467
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,530
it's actually a high quality so you know

468
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,850
we keep yes if you're hacker you can

469
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,320
take advantage of this and if you're in

470
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,899
a defender we think this is worthwhile

471
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,110
mentioning or it's worthwhile followed

472
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,910
so so they do a nice job we've talked

473
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,439
about this is linked to I think there's

474
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,050
a French version of this database also

475
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,000
there's a japanese version or of the

476
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:12,419
equivalent so we're gonna go benchmark

477
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,340
against other countries as well and see

478
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,400
you know try it will do more work on

479
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:20,100
this now there's a but there is there's

480
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,960
always a budget so oh and by the way you

481
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,879
can download this report just for free

482
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,920
just you know go to this record

483
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,720
future.com slash chinese vulnerability

484
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,040
reporting you can download it you don't

485
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,810
even need to remember that you'll find

486
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,770
it on the website so there dragon is

487
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:37,950
winning and yeah so now it gets tricky

488
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,900
so we were sort of thinking that

489
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,300
wondering and like if sometimes these

490
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,670
guys sit on these vulnerabilities do

491
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,040
they sort of just hold on so we look at

492
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,440
this shanghai add ups that's I've grown

493
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:53,510
old kinds of details it was an implant

494
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:57,510
put into Android it was used in tracking

495
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:59,820
protesters in Hong Kong so here November

496
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,580
2016 New York Times report on this it

497
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,019
was known before

498
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,178
but that was sort of the first open

499
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:06,220
source piece on this secret backdoor and

500
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:08,740
some use phone sent data back to China

501
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,600
oh you know and people are Google and

502
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,409
Android got all upset you could imagine

503
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,908
sauce turns out that here the NVD the

504
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:18,610
u.s. Committee publishes that pretty

505
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:20,470
quickly you know just like a month later

506
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,350
or something

507
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:25,179
CBS s foreign dollars in this case the

508
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:29,918
Chinese sat on it for two hundred thirty

509
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:33,100
six days so yes they can be sinister so

510
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,740
you know they may be fast in general but

511
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,299
and then some cases still sit on them so

512
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,399
we're gonna come back and write a report

513
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:41,679
and you know it turns out that for

514
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:44,139
example on Adobe which we know that the

515
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,659
Chinese love to hack Adobe Flash in

516
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:49,299
every way the rest in Adobe on or on

517
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:51,010
Adobe they're much slower than normal so

518
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:54,010
we'd sort of go down the list of vendors

519
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:56,139
and see where are they statistically

520
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,419
slow and I love that some sort of a data

521
00:20:56,139 --> 00:21:00,639
guy so seeing his beginnings much fun

522
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:02,260
when you can actually use statistics to

523
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:04,360
you know you can you can always argue

524
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,029
about a case of one or two but we can

525
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,178
use statistics and actually do this ends

526
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:11,950
up being a lot of fun so anyway some of

527
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:14,080
that you know I sort of think about all

528
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,480
this stuff as you know what's the game

529
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,789
of a year I think in French you know

530
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,529
like this is what we're trying to do you

531
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:22,690
know these pictures are you know that's

532
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,730
connecting the dots here you know you

533
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,470
can sort of many times see what's going

534
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,090
on but you know the role of threat

535
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,580
intelligence is trying to figure that

536
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,230
out so what we do when recruited future

537
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,779
is try to figure out like I'm gonna

538
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,730
track the aging ping is saying or being

539
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:39,429
able to in real time or organize all the

540
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,860
world knows about MSS or a PT 3 or

541
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:44,409
therapy or particular corner ability or

542
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,779
down to an individual domain we try to

543
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:48,700
in real time collect all that data and

544
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:51,549
get that to the defender so they can

545
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,610
basically do a better job of connecting

546
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:56,679
the dots in real time which is sort of

547
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,570
what you know but if you worked on the

548
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:01,389
defendant defense it's like that's what

549
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,950
what we're trying to do and and you know

550
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:05,350
we put this to work in threat

551
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,610
intelligence or you know so we're if

552
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,980
people want to use this in their

553
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:11,168
software Incident Response and so on

554
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,929
there could be enriching IOC zorda

555
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:16,089
murder determining the severity of

556
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:17,830
so on and so forth so and it could be

557
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:19,629
something you do stand alone and refer

558
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,070
future or it may be your a Splunk user

559
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:23,769
and you want to do this inside Splunk

560
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,779
and all of those sort of cases are

561
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:27,489
possible so if you want to know more

562
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:30,339
about this go to recruiter futurecom we

563
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:32,019
published a lot of research around apt 3

564
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:34,330
and china and the whole sort of Chinese

565
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:36,429
information security apparatus there's

566
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,228
three four key blogs in that subject I

567
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:40,389
would recommend you check out they also

568
00:22:38,229 --> 00:22:42,249
like our recent North Korea stuff that

569
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:45,039
we've been putting out there so very

570
00:22:42,249 --> 00:22:46,299
timely and and juicy feel free to

571
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,119
contact me

572
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:52,089
future or see a prequel to future down

573
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,738
here at the bottom you colleague arashan

574
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:57,239
peer if you want to speak to prefer to

575
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:57,239
speak to a French guy you can get to him

576
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:03,089
future and that's it so any questions

577
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:07,859
make sense

578
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:25,809
we're so you mentioned you know so again

579
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:28,269
we're trying to be a little bit careful

580
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:29,830
but not putting that out too early but

581
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:33,070
no said nobody was the one that stood

582
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:35,049
out Microsoft there for example they

583
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,658
there's a couple of Chinese vendors that

584
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:39,309
they're better at no surprise and that's

585
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:40,719
probably not sinister it is probably

586
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,779
this because that better data flow

587
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:45,669
around that Google and Oracle and a few

588
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:47,649
others it's very similar sort of thing

589
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:50,349
but there were a few others that stood

590
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:52,418
out but I think don't we at Microsoft

591
00:23:50,349 --> 00:23:55,869
were the ones that sort of stood out

592
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:59,489
that at the top so we'll be back with

593
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:59,488
this sort of the full analysis on that

594
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:12,869
information worker failed having and

595
00:24:06,729 --> 00:24:12,869
calling how attention to that

596
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:19,790
using those particular means the Chinese

597
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:23,059
yeah I know it is but I think this is

598
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:25,520
the point that wide you know I hate use

599
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:27,559
word big data but you know like people

600
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,030
don't think that it's possible to

601
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:32,210
observe this it turns out that this

602
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:35,030
Chinese database it's it's it's open

603
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:37,910
source you just go to right now it's

604
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:39,889
there it tends to go up and down it's

605
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,510
right so it's hard to get to sort of

606
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,580
like it's it's technically open sorted

607
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,830
it's only in Chinese and so on so it

608
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,120
took us a lot of work to download you

609
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,330
know it's about a hundred thousand

610
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,860
American Sita's Seabees in the American

611
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,840
database there's about a hundred

612
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,790
thousand actually remarkable parity

613
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,559
between the two we think that Chinese

614
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,210
backed into it by downloading the

615
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:01,190
American first one to sort of just give

616
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:04,700
up to parity but even in the ongoing

617
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:08,030
native flow it's pretty much parity the

618
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,200
but it's I don't think they sort of

619
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,910
thought about the idea that somebody

620
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,059
would know a little thing and start

621
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:15,740
doing analysis on it so you know that I

622
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:18,678
think there's a lot of stuff in the

623
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,059
world that intelligence agencies you

624
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:21,440
know they tend you know people who are

625
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:22,910
in OPSEC sort of thinking about the

626
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,610
opposite they tend to think more about

627
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:27,740
like how do i do things you know and

628
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,870
keep myself secret but you know when i

629
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,090
put the whole organization on their

630
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,469
observation i can find things that even

631
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,050
if people are brilliant at the

632
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:43,880
individual case they may not are there

633
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:45,440
other statistically significant lags so

634
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,240
if we think there are you know to be

635
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,830
honest even if i'm obviously sort of

636
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,940
sound american here i'm better we want

637
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,159
to go look for the same thing in the

638
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,260
american one you know like you know I

639
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,990
think in America this reports internists

640
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,790
and you know it's a little harder for it

641
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,250
and but who knows let's go find out

642
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,990
there is you know the Japanese one is

643
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,460
there so that we good one to benchmark

644
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,590
against you could imagine maybe there is

645
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,440
something being in Southeast Asia versus

646
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,330
us makes it different but you know and I

647
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,179
do I'd love to talk to anybody of that I

648
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,860
I think there's a French vulnerability

649
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:17,570
database and there's there's not a

650
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,059
Russian one there's not a British one

651
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,860
but you know go find other resources

652
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:23,750
like this you know the one would be but

653
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,350
oldest certs around the world and see

654
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:28,770
how fast they are the report

655
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:30,570
things so you know like making putting

656
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:33,660
intelligence agencies on notice is a lot

657
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,580
of fun we've done this before before

658
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,799
with the Iranians and you know they're

659
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,689
tracking them but then once you people

660
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:41,940
do you know sort of pattern of life

661
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,530
analysis that people need to pattern

662
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,240
apply for tracking a bad guy and

663
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,280
individual terrorist Authority sort of

664
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,600
an individual organization that's one

665
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,820
thing but when you do it to hold it

666
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:57,240
agency that is not used to be observed

667
00:26:50,820 --> 00:27:01,168
it's it can be fun to solve business in

668
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,510
China trying to work so what is the

669
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:06,630
solution so we you know we're very early

670
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,980
and and so we have a one client I don't

671
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,539
think I don't know if there's a really

672
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,700
good solution I know we talked about

673
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:15,030
this last night and there's if you

674
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:17,070
really want to I think you can probably

675
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,500
come up with very complicated technical

676
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:23,129
solutions to sort of avoid this or you

677
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,320
may sort of have to say we will have to

678
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,000
work with it and we will have to provide

679
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,070
information which I need Microsoft

680
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,320
obviously gave their damn source codes

681
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:33,120
you know we're not gonna give our source

682
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,100
code to the Chinese but you know that I

683
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,510
think this and I think this is maybe

684
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,178
something that's gonna happen around the

685
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:41,100
world that countries are gonna under the

686
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,929
auspices of information security are

687
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,820
gonna say look you need to provide

688
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:47,820
access to your data centers provide

689
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,600
access to and I think we're in for the

690
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,730
very interesting next 10 years on this I

691
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,219
do not have a good simple solution to

692
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:59,570
that yes I say does it each team

693
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:12,390
topic and perfect clients that type of

694
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:15,059
operations in China they're the SA ours

695
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,890
to be able to do data data segregation

696
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,120
from unable to be perfected but the

697
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,140
weirdest thing is its particular if

698
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,729
you're building physical plant for

699
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,900
manufacturing operations in China though

700
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,130
the biggest thing for your part of a

701
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,780
considered curtain critical of the

702
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,120
structure they have to come in and give

703
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:30,928
a physical analysis of the entire

704
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,270
Factory and that during that two to six

705
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:36,070
feet dark period the MSS gets full

706
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:38,500
access to the entire operation so

707
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:42,159
in the task organization that I have

708
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:44,530
worked with as please Ocoee attends you

709
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,600
will hide out weeks months years later

710
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,820
that the equipment that you originally

711
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,310
placed is has to fully replace from

712
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,320
another board down the entire box is

713
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:55,530
still the original box where the

714
00:28:53,320 --> 00:29:00,840
motherboard valve is replaced with

715
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:03,129
attorney state actor it's just part of

716
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,419
physical aspect of having you do

717
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:07,420
business there so that's bodyweight

718
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:12,390
build us a great feed information and

719
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,390
get their legal requirements without I

720
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,830
think we should not be sort of that what

721
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:28,480
do you want to call it naive about it

722
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,889
this happens in other countries too you

723
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,900
know like it happens there everywhere

724
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,340
but I think you know again look even a

725
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:37,270
little Sweden probably just the same

726
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:39,070
thing when it's necessary but it's just

727
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,900
that a whole different scale and the

728
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,070
laws and everything area like so it's

729
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,110
gonna be very complicated because

730
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,189
obviously very few companies can say

731
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:48,399
look I'm just going to stay away from

732
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:51,850
China the you know it's it's it's tricky

733
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:54,490
is there another question no all right

734
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:58,490
very good thank you

735
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:58,490
[Applause]
