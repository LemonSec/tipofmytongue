1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,879
all right

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,599
well i hope everybody has been enjoying

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,400
um

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,480
this b-side that's

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,719
had a lot of really good talks

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,480
mark had a good conversation good talk

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
about the cmmc protocol which goes right

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,439
along with with where i'm going to and

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,960
then stephen kirby talked about pci dss

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,240
which is one of the most common

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,119
frameworks that covers most businesses

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,679
but sometimes when it comes down to this

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,200
people just kind of wonder where does it

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,760
all start from where do we go so let's

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,120
talk about grc and what grc is grc

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,440
stands for governance risk and

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,680
compliance

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,000
governance addresses how you make what's

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,600
your plan how's your business going to

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,360
be set up how's it going to work what's

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,160
going to happen if you have a disaster

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,480
or for instance a ransomware attack

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,920
governance would be where you would

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,559
determine how you're going to handle

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,879
your business then you get into risk and

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,559
that's looking at what are the threats

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,239
what's what's your issues what are your

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,080
problems what are things that we need to

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,240
deal with and those will vary from

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,000
industry to industry and then finally

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
compliance and compliance is one of the

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,960
areas that is the most changing in our

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,119
industry because as you can see it's

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,680
based upon laws regulations standards

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,520
it's things that are changing and

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,479
constantly being modified and updated so

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,799
grc well it seems like this kind of a

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,159
little nutshell

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,079
it really has a lot of complexity to it

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,920
and when you look at this graphic

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,000
you'll see there's different pieces to

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,479
grc and each one of these pieces kind of

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,680
blends into the next one and so you know

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,439
for instance if you're doing audits

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,960
those audits are going to bring about a

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,720
strategy management what am i going to

47
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,560
do what the audit findings what am i

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,320
going to do but it's also going to bring

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,079
about what are the controls i'm going to

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,479
bring into place to make myself

51
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,600
compliant for the next audit

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,799
so

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,600
why do grc first of all

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,320
most businesses are or will be needing

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,880
to meet some type of compliance

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,759
you go down to the mall even though they

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,758
may be there at that little

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,360
vendor in the middle and they're selling

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,200
their credit card stuff

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,599
if something happened and that person

61
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,840
was found out to be storing all the

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,080
credit card data they would be out of

63
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,160
compliance and they would now face the

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,959
laws and the penalties of the law for

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,280
keeping that data and not securing it

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
and then you get into the larger

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,480
corporations and for many of the

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
corporations in order to do business

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,959
with the people that they do business

70
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,040
with they've got certain compliancy

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,519
requirements that they have to meet

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,080
you also have it's not a one-time event

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
so when i go in and write a compliance

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,480
document and i say okay i've evaluated

75
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,720
my business i've looked at what's going

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
on in my business and i've set out all

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,200
my plans and i've written them all up

78
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
i'm not done now i need to go back and

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,800
look at each one of these documents

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,599
again i need to start over and reassess

81
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,400
where am i at where has what has changed

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,040
what's come up you know ransomware

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,599
malware spam fishing all of that stuff

84
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,920
is continually evolving and so our

85
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,840
compliance is going to be changing to

86
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,720
keep up with that

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,480
mitigation becomes more and more

88
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,200
difficult if you don't have a standard

89
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,319
you know

90
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,879
a lot of people go into the industry and

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,720
they just kind of focus in their one

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,159
place and they don't think about the

93
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,760
fact that that little piece of the

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,680
industry that they're working in

95
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,200
is doing what it's doing because there's

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,519
a standard some of you are greenville

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,440
tech students there's a standard in

98
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,599
order to complete the class and that

99
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,840
class sets up that standard and if you

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
don't want to comply with it you're not

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,599
going to be successful in completing the

102
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,440
class well businesses are exactly the

103
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,640
same way

104
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,799
but the nasty part for businesses is

105
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,720
they're not the ones necessarily who are

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
creating the requirements it's it's the

107
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,680
bad guys it's the people who are trying

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,439
to get into their system that are going

109
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,680
to have to affect enforce

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,799
how that business is going to react and

111
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,040
how they're going to respond to those

112
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
risks and that mitigation and that's

113
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,439
what compliance is all about is looking

114
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,319
at that changing landscape and

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,720
determining how am i going to deal with

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,478
it what what am i going to do to deal

117
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,798
with these risks and finally it's an

118
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,839
open job market on the 31st of september

119
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,280
i did just a quick

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,320
search in zip recruiter under grc and as

121
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,120
you can see almost 6 000 jobs were

122
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,199
listed out there under grc on zip

123
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,440
recruiter with a salary ranging between

124
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,199
102 and 171 000.

125
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,199
you know it's an open industry we have

126
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,040
so many requirements coming by if you

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,840
listen to mark's uh presentation on this

128
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,880
channel the first presentation on cmmc

129
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,199
that's a a new standard that everybody

130
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,360
is talking about becoming compliant for

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
especially if you want to do anything

132
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,639
with

133
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,120
purchasing or connecting your business

134
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,960
into the federal market

135
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,039
you're going to have to be cmmc report

136
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,400
compliant but cmmc compliance is still

137
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,280
still changing and still molding and so

138
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,560
getting into these jobs are going to be

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,800
a little bit easier now than it will be

140
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,960
later but there's going to be a growing

141
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,360
number of jobs needed to be able to fill

142
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,560
these compliance spots for the gr for

143
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,720
the cmmc

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
so where do you start

145
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,120
you know for a lot of people

146
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,400
they don't know what to do i want to

147
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,880
kind of do grc but it can be a daunting

148
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,199
task i remember with the university when

149
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,000
i started my job in 2018

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,240
while we were doing many of the things

151
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,720
that made us compliant and would show us

152
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,320
to be compliant

153
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,919
we didn't have

154
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,680
didn't have any idea where we were going

155
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,120
well we had the privilege that the

156
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,680
federal government came to us and said

157
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,199
you're going to need to be compliant to

158
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,520
this 800-171

159
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,759
so i didn't have to go search and find

160
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,080
the standard steven just gave a great

161
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,360
presentation on using pci dss

162
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,400
as a data standard just replace

163
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,120
credit card information with secure

164
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,919
information and you have a compliance

165
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,759
standard you have a place to start from

166
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,600
so the beginning of where to start is

167
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,199
find a standard

168
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,360
then determine what industries will be

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,520
need to be covered by that standard you

170
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,680
know sometimes we do it the other way

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,000
you're interested in a specific industry

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,759
and so you'll go look for the standards

173
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,360
that meet the industry but you can do it

174
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,680
backwards you can look at the standards

175
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,759
and say you know i'm kind of interested

176
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,000
in this standard this standard kind of

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,639
keeps my attention i see where i could

178
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,720
kind of fit into this market

179
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,080
and then you'll find the industries

180
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,639
that'll be covered but you can go either

181
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,639
way either either way we'll keep

182
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,880
everything flowing just the way we want

183
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,560
it to

184
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,520
then gather the information

185
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,919
attend b-side events attend training

186
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,080
events you get on youtube you can find

187
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,560
all kinds of information on youtube

188
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,800
about hey here's the standard here's

189
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,319
what's going on in the standard here's

190
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,479
how to be compliant in the standard now

191
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,759
of course

192
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,080
you have to be careful you can also find

193
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,319
information out on youtube that's not

194
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,319
going to lead you in the right direction

195
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,199
so

196
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,520
gather information see what goes on with

197
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
the industry see what goes on in that

198
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,680
compliance standard and what are you

199
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,800
going to do

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,639
and finally

201
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,479
maybe the place to start is with people

202
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,160
you currently work for

203
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,319
there's a lot of companies out there

204
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,120
that

205
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
while they in practice

206
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,919
are compliant with standards

207
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,080
they really don't have the paperwork

208
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,479
because when it comes down to grc

209
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,639
much of the grc work

210
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,599
is the paperwork it's the creation of

211
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,680
the documents that say here's what our

212
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,199
standards are going to be it's the

213
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,440
documents that say hey here's how we've

214
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
got our network configured or here's how

215
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,240
we've got our information secured or

216
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
here's the practices for account

217
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,639
creation and how we determine what a

218
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,759
user can or can't do on our network

219
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,360
because when it comes down to the

220
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,479
standards

221
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,120
the reviewers will look and see what

222
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,639
you're doing but they're also going to

223
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,720
see what you have in writing and when

224
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,840
you're dealing with the federal

225
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,400
government which i have to in my case if

226
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,479
i don't have it in writing as far as the

227
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,960
federal government is concerned

228
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,599
it's not going on it's not happening and

229
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,759
so many times you can be working for

230
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,440
somebody and they just need somebody to

231
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,199
help with the paperwork they need

232
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,960
somebody to help with the reviews so

233
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,840
sometimes the place to start is to go to

234
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,919
your employer find out what they're

235
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,120
doing and find out if they need

236
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,159
assistance in this

237
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,760
finally you can look at the different

238
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,000
standards organizations nist has been

239
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
mentioned a couple times in some of the

240
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,160
different presentations and pretty much

241
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
if you're going to do anything that

242
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,920
deals with any kind of data from the

243
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
federal government

244
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,200
this is going to be the standard that

245
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
you're going to comply to

246
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,959
but nist covers more than just cyber

247
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,880
security you'll notice it's the national

248
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,680
institute of standards and testing

249
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
nist is the one who determines how

250
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,240
they're going to be uh what what the

251
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,200
standard for crypt cryptological work is

252
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,959
they determine what the standards are

253
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,839
for determining uh the atomic clock

254
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,480
determining what a unit of measure is

255
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,959
nist covers this very broad area but one

256
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,640
of the areas they cover

257
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,480
is cyber security

258
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,959
but nist is pretty much related only to

259
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,640
the united states

260
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,519
iso is an international organization so

261
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,160
you've heard of iso ratings like the 27

262
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,480
0001 which was mentioned in a previous

263
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,800
uh previous presentation

264
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,120
but there's also in industry standards

265
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
that really don't have anything to do

266
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,880
with cyber security but it's still a grc

267
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,040
event because you're looking to set up a

268
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,279
standardization of how something is

269
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,519
produced how something is manufactured

270
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,440
so that it can be determined to be

271
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,160
compliant with other entities from an

272
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,080
international point of view so that they

273
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,440
know they can work together pc idss

274
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,519
again this one's pretty much the united

275
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,920
states only but we are seeing it move

276
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,760
out into some other countries that deal

277
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
a lot into the united states

278
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,720
gdpr this has been in the news

279
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,839
a lot

280
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,000
but this pretty much only deals with

281
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,079
europe but maybe you're working for a

282
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,320
small organization who

283
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,880
is building a product or is offering a

284
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,920
service

285
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,240
and they pick up a customer who happens

286
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,320
to reside in france

287
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,560
well your company is now going to have

288
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,120
to show how you're going to be gdpr

289
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,000
compliant with the data that comes from

290
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,320
those users there in france what you're

291
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,079
going to do

292
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,399
here in the united states gdpr is really

293
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,399
a guideline for us we don't have any

294
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,399
real requirements here in the united

295
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,200
states to be compliant to gdpr but the

296
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,760
practices that it outlines many many

297
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,079
organizations have sought to put into

298
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,279
place because

299
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,640
california with their ccpa is a very

300
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
similar guideline to gdpr

301
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,440
and so if you deal with

302
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,680
transactions and deal with individuals

303
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,600
in california you're going to have to

304
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,839
make sure that your data protections for

305
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,200
those individuals

306
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,760
is ccpa compliant

307
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,399
i worked in the education industry so

308
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,640
ferpa is a big

309
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,519
big compliancy standard for us

310
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,839
but ferpa really only deals with just

311
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,399
student data and student records it

312
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,160
doesn't deal with the rest of the data

313
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,720
that goes on in our organization but

314
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,440
ferpa is that overarching

315
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,680
certification that we have to keep up

316
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,600
and there's many others

317
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,519
again depending on the industry in you

318
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,800
may find a standard that's very specific

319
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,880
because of what you're doing i have a

320
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,720
friend who runs a air aircraft parts

321
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,360
organization and they've got some very

322
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
specific

323
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,519
standards that they have to meet to be

324
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,839
able to sell aircraft parts even though

325
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,440
they're not manufacturing they're just

326
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,200
basically a wholesaler they're buying

327
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,440
parts and selling parts they still have

328
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,200
a whole bunch of standards that they

329
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,120
have to keep up and be able to stay in

330
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,600
compliance with in order to sell

331
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,519
these aircraft parts and so depending on

332
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,040
the organization that you're working

333
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,839
with

334
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,839
the the requirements and those standards

335
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,079
may change so you need to see what are

336
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,760
the standards that i would need to be

337
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
working on during the industry that i'm

338
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,839
looking toward

339
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,000
finally how do you help a business

340
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,399
well this chart shows a risk reward and

341
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,040
that's really what grc is what we're

342
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,360
looking for in grc is we're looking to

343
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,079
find out what the risks are before i can

344
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,920
figure out what my rewards are i've got

345
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,480
to know what the risks are so categorize

346
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,560
them by level find the risk find out are

347
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,720
they severe are they moderate are they

348
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,639
low what's the category that they're

349
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,800
going to fall on and then give a

350
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,959
priority to the items in each level once

351
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,040
you've determined what your risks are

352
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,959
then you have to deciding how do i

353
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,399
prioritize them where am i going to put

354
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,120
the priority and when we do the priority

355
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
we're going to create a plan and that

356
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,800
plan is going to start with the items

357
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,600
that are going to fix the highest risks

358
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,639
that we can but have the greatest reward

359
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,720
sometimes those risks are going to be

360
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,399
low risk but they're going to have a

361
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,320
great reward sometimes they're going to

362
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,240
be high but you want to start with that

363
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,480
highest risk as high as you can get with

364
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
the least amount of effort

365
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,440
mfa

366
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,600
everybody hears about it it's almost

367
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
become the standard buzzword but it's

368
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,800
amazing to me

369
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,279
the number of people who still

370
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,920
don't know what mfa is when you mention

371
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,360
the term to them

372
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,440
most people do it you know if you have

373
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,920
google account or if you have a yahoo

374
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,839
account or if you've got some account on

375
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,120
the internet

376
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
if it's doing what it's supposed to do

377
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,880
they're going to want to know that you

378
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,760
are who you say you are when you try to

379
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,680
access your account and that's the

380
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,600
purpose for mfa and turning on mfa has a

381
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
really high reward and it really doesn't

382
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,959
take much effort in most systems it's a

383
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,959
click of a button that says we're going

384
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,279
to turn on multi-factor authentication

385
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,760
now getting people to comply or getting

386
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,639
people to put the things in place for

387
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,040
multi-factor authentication can have a

388
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,360
little bit higher cost to it

389
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,120
but that's going to be determined on

390
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,920
your industry in my industry having a

391
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,320
cell phone and then getting a text a

392
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,720
code and typing a code in is more than

393
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,240
sufficient for me to be able to

394
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,560
authenticate my users but you may work

395
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,519
in an in an organization or an industry

396
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,519
that needs to be so more secure so you

397
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,680
may have to be able to put in biometrics

398
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,560
or you may have to have multiple

399
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,959
layers of multi-factor authentication to

400
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,680
determine who the user is based upon

401
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,560
the

402
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,959
uh security of the information that that

403
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,199
user is supposing is supposed to be

404
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,680
using another one of those things that

405
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,920
gives you fixes a high risk but doesn't

406
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
take a lot of effort

407
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,760
is turning encryption on all mobile

408
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,079
devices and systems if you've got a

409
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,480
computer or your user's got a computer

410
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,959
that accesses or uses company

411
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,720
information

412
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,800
it should have encryption on it

413
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,959
and that just protects you in the case

414
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,480
of it being lost

415
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
if that users you know we have this

416
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,399
happen from time to time someone is

417
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,760
traveling and i'll get a phone call my

418
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,519
laptop's been stolen

419
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,079
well in our case all mobile devices for

420
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,920
the university require that data

421
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,000
encryption is put in place and so i can

422
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,079
go out into our management system i can

423
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,160
click a couple buttons and i can lock

424
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,240
the device down nobody's going to use it

425
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,759
nobody's going to get to it even if they

426
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,440
destroy the device and pull the hard

427
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,519
drive out of it because encryption has

428
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,440
been turned and turned on for all those

429
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,800
devices

430
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,399
i'm not worried about somebody getting

431
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,519
to the data that we want protected

432
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,079
and that's a really easy thing to do is

433
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,120
start with those high risk low effort

434
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
items

435
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,000
and then look for ways

436
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
for gold to meet goals without high

437
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,639
expenditures money is always tight you

438
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,959
know everywhere i've ever worked at

439
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,040
including when i worked for myself there

440
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,880
were a lot of things that i saw that i'd

441
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
be like oh that'd be really cool i wish

442
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,240
i could do that

443
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,480
but the money just wasn't there

444
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,040
but especially when it comes to grc

445
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,759
there doesn't have to always be a large

446
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,199
outlay of money

447
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,360
there are so many government services

448
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,759
and so many industry services now that

449
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,320
are offering you

450
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,680
great

451
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,560
risk to reward benefits for instance one

452
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,959
of the best ways to help protect your

453
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,240
users is data security training

454
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,720
take the time to have the users go

455
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,279
through training quarterly annually

456
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,199
semi-annually whatever you determine is

457
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,839
the best method for you but put them

458
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,759
through training well that means

459
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,800
somebody's got to create the content

460
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,199
not everybody is a creative genius i for

461
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,880
one am not

462
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,800
we contract with the company to do our

463
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,880
data security training but there are a

464
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,360
whole lot of government services stay

465
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,799
safe online

466
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,119
is a government service the

467
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,959
cici

468
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,799
is another government service and many

469
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,280
of these services will offer free data

470
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,359
training yeah they might be simplistic

471
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,199
yeah they may not cover everything that

472
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,559
a company needs but in to get started

473
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,400
when money is tight

474
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,559
get these free services use these free

475
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,520
services to go out and train your users

476
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,919
to go out and gather those resources

477
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,440
as was mentioned the

478
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,880
dss in the last uh last session was

479
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,600
mentioned that many of the documents to

480
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,720
create this are free out there on their

481
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
websites you can go to their website

482
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,600
again you don't have to pay for a large

483
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
service with a large organized

484
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,000
documentation system to be able to make

485
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,080
yourself compliant or start to reach

486
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,000
toward compliance you can reach out and

487
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,720
use the free services

488
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,880
and also to understand that the best way

489
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
sometimes to fix the problem is just get

490
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,400
engaged with the users

491
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,840
when i started our risk system in 2018

492
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,919
at the university one of the biggest

493
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,760
things that i learned very quickly is

494
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,400
that i had to get out and i had to seek

495
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,480
opportunities to talk in front of our

496
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,039
faculty and staff to talk to them about

497
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,440
the need to be secure the need to be

498
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,160
compliant the need to pay attention to

499
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,880
the emails they're receiving because we

500
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
we live in the higher ed realm we are

501
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,520
one of the prime targets for malicious

502
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,400
actors they are sending emails into our

503
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,640
system all the time trying to get our

504
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,960
users to give up their username and

505
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,799
password or even

506
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,960
even more common nowadays they're trying

507
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,840
to get our users to buy apple gift cards

508
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,520
uh so that they can you know give them

509
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,840
to somebody who's busy

510
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,880
and so

511
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,960
that's sometimes the best resolution to

512
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,520
fix your problem is just get involved

513
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,080
with the users go out and talk with them

514
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,880
take the fear and the worry about what

515
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,240
they're going to do and what's going to

516
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,000
happen if they accidentally click on the

517
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,720
wrong thing get rid of that fear help

518
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,559
them to feel comfortable

519
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
in being safe

520
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,000
once you've got your plan work the plan

521
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,080
don't give up because of a failure

522
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
so many places

523
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,400
they create a plan and they look at this

524
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,240
plan as though this is going to be the

525
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,919
thing that's going to keep this issue

526
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,559
from happening

527
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,360
we all work with people

528
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
we're people ourselves

529
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,120
we all have times where we're sitting

530
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,799
there flipping through our email we're

531
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,320
really busy there's a whole bunch of

532
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,000
stuff going on and all of a sudden this

533
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,320
email comes through and oh it looks like

534
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
it's so valuable it looks like it's so

535
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,799
real i need to i need to respond to this

536
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,360
quick and then find out oh oops i

537
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,039
shouldn't have done that those type of

538
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,080
things happen but failures aren't

539
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,160
the end of a program failures are

540
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,400
opportunities to re-evaluate the plan

541
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,880
let's look at the plan what could i do

542
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,039
or what could i have done

543
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,400
to either help train my users or help

544
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,960
the company to put things in place to

545
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,840
protect the data in my organization if

546
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,440
something were to happen

547
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,000
and then be willing to update that plan

548
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,200
again

549
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
grc is not a one-time event it's

550
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,440
something that we have to understand

551
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,600
that we have to continually go back and

552
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,000
change and update and be willing to

553
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,840
float and flex

554
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,280
based upon what's going on

555
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,880
and then update your knowledge

556
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,559
get involved in organizations like

557
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,720
b-sides that will help you learn new

558
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,000
things

559
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,880
my market that i work in is grc

560
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,000
but i'm also involved in the defcon 864

561
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,039
group

562
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,280
they're a little more pointed toward

563
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,799
penetration testing toward that side of

564
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,080
the market

565
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
but i enjoy going to the meetings and i

566
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,240
enjoy listening and being involved in

567
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,960
webinars about penetration testing i

568
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,600
don't do any of that for a living most

569
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
of what goes on when it comes to that

570
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,799
goes over my head i watched ben's uh

571
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,799
presentation about his tool which i

572
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,600
think is a really cool tool

573
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,120
most of it goes over my head because i

574
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,640
don't do anything with penetration

575
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,679
testing

576
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,120
but by my

577
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,480
getting to know

578
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,520
what he does and how he finds the issues

579
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,159
that he finds and how he does his test

580
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,520
it helps me in creating my documentation

581
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,600
to say okay wait a minute if this is the

582
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,000
way that the bad guys usually go about

583
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,600
what what can i do

584
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
to get stuff put in place and then i can

585
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,679
document that hey these are issues and

586
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,640
we need to now go resolve these issues

587
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,000
take any training you can afford

588
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
it's wonderful that some of the things

589
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,520
that are being given away some of the

590
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,400
items that are are being given out are

591
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,440
testing penetration testing classes or

592
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,400
times

593
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,320
opportunities to get onto penetration

594
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,400
systems to to practice and test your

595
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,760
skills

596
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,000
take training go out and learn something

597
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,919
maybe it's not even something that you

598
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,280
feel is associated to the the item that

599
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,640
you're doing

600
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,400
it's just the fact that you're willing

601
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
to expand your mind expand your thought

602
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,039
process expand what you know because

603
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,960
sometimes that new little piece of

604
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,919
information that you gain from something

605
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,080
is that little thing you needed to give

606
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,799
a nudge to help you understand how i can

607
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,640
better

608
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,000
prepare for

609
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,240
an event that i wouldn't be expecting

610
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,760
and by going through those trainings you

611
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,880
can get that or even better

612
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,320
get someone to pay for you to go to

613
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,559
training because remember

614
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,080
knowledge

615
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,440
is power

616
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,960
never become complacent with your

617
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,360
accomplishments never get to your to a

618
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,840
place where you're oh i understand this

619
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,840
i know what i'm doing i'm just in a

620
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,400
great place i'm going to continue on

621
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,240
when we get to that place

622
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,679
in this industry you're going to find

623
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,679
yourself being left behind because the

624
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,600
industry will continue to move the

625
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,679
continue the industry will continue to

626
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,760
expand and change

627
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,039
yes i might be compliant from you know

628
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,480
10 years ago

629
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,919
but the industry changed and those

630
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,440
things that i know

631
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,200
probably are not as relevant anymore

632
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,880
so now what

633
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
well determine your model

634
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
what are you going to do

635
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,120
are you going to work for someone

636
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,360
or maybe work for yourself

637
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,159
as was mentioned in the cmmc chat in

638
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,120
this channel in the first chat

639
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,280
there's a lot of people who are going to

640
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,200
be needed to go out and do these

641
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,080
evaluations for these companies

642
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,760
maybe the the model that you're going to

643
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,440
work in is not that you're going to work

644
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,080
for someone else but you're going to get

645
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
yourself the training education you

646
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,159
needed you need to be able to become a

647
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,080
cmmc auditor

648
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,360
and now

649
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,039
you're going to make the engagements

650
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,720
maybe through other companies who are

651
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,159
doing this and you're going to offer

652
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,799
services you can work as a contractor

653
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,240
maybe that's the model that's going to

654
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,640
work we've got all kinds of small and

655
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,799
medium businesses around us many of them

656
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,279
have no kind of plan in place they've

657
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,440
got nothing in place to help protect

658
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
their systems help protect their data

659
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,039
because they just see themselves as a

660
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,000
nobody but the bad guys want them just

661
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
as bad as they want the fortune 500 and

662
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,240
so maybe you can work for yourself and

663
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,480
go out and offer services to these

664
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,799
companies to help them to become

665
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,200
compliant help to protect their networks

666
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,960
helps protect their data

667
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,799
or you can go to work for someone else

668
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,400
narrow your focus

669
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,559
when i started in the computer industry

670
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,440
back in 1993

671
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,520
i had the mindset that i was gonna learn

672
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,360
everything i was gonna know how to do

673
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,799
everything there was to do with a

674
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,360
computer well back in 1993 there wasn't

675
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,600
a lot that could be done with a computer

676
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,679
but it was still bigger than ultimately

677
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,720
one person could become a master of and

678
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,480
and do really well

679
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
and today we really need to narrow the

680
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,760
focus find the part that you like find

681
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,679
the area that you want to focus on and

682
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,960
focus there

683
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,120
but don't be afraid to change that

684
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,520
you may work in the grc industry and as

685
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,360
you work in the compliancy and you

686
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,840
create the policies and you create the

687
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,640
procedures you evaluate the risks

688
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,240
you may all of a sudden decide you know

689
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,000
hey

690
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
that thought of being able to go out and

691
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,840
detect the risk those that thought of

692
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,400
being able to go out and and expose the

693
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,120
risks by penetration seems really really

694
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,520
interesting to me and so your focus may

695
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,600
start out at one side

696
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,520
but you may change and be willing to

697
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,919
make that change be willing to step away

698
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,720
from maybe what is the comfort zone

699
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,520
and move on into something else

700
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,480
but again keep a focus find a spot that

701
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,720
you want to work in and then stay there

702
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,400
once you've narrowed the focus create a

703
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,600
plan

704
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,679
determine how am i going to get there

705
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,320
how am i going to get a job for someone

706
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,840
else or how am i going to be able to

707
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,159
work for myself what training what

708
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,039
certifications what things do i need to

709
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,559
be able to come to a company and say

710
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,919
i'm valuable i'm worth hiring i'm worth

711
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,279
employing

712
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,760
once you've created your plan

713
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,480
work the plan

714
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,960
just keep at it don't give up maybe

715
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,720
you've got to start out in an area where

716
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,360
i'm not quite in the area that i want to

717
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,600
but it gets my foot in the door to get

718
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,840
me started i always chuckle when i see

719
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,799
the ads you know this is a this is an

720
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,960
opening entry level position but we want

721
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,159
you to have four years of experience

722
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,720
how do you can you do entry level and

723
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,120
have four years of experience

724
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,200
so sometimes you've got to try to get

725
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,520
yourself into those situations and you

726
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,840
you give your experience by showing that

727
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,720
hey

728
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,039
i went out and i did this training on

729
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,039
the side that gave me give me some

730
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,799
experience i got involved in this

731
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,679
organization to give me some experience

732
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,919
going to b-sides going to

733
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,919
capture the flag events just getting

734
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,600
involved in things that would build up a

735
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,000
resume and show that hey i have the

736
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,919
knowledge and the skills to show that i

737
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,559
can be of benefit to your company

738
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,320
and then as i said earlier

739
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
never be afraid to change

740
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
because sometimes in working our

741
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,520
industry

742
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,200
you hit a point where you get burned out

743
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,520
and that's a really tough place to be in

744
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,919
when you hit that burnout stage and for

745
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,679
a lot of people

746
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,919
their way of responding to burnout is

747
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,960
they just completely walk away from it

748
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,399
because they don't want to make a change

749
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,000
they're afraid to move to somewhere else

750
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,600
they're afraid they'd maybe fail or they

751
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,159
maybe wouldn't be good enough

752
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,919
never be afraid to make a change

753
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,799
sometimes a model that you're following

754
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,399
is going to come to an end because the

755
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,159
industry has just changed so much that

756
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,159
model doesn't work anymore

757
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,559
so be paying attention be watching

758
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,880
what's going on and always be willing to

759
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,279
tweak and change just a little bit about

760
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,399
what you do

761
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,320
and how you do it

762
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,880
i knew my plan my my conversation wasn't

763
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,240
going to take up the whole time

764
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,440
so

765
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,200
i'm to the end of my presentation but

766
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,480

767
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,520
