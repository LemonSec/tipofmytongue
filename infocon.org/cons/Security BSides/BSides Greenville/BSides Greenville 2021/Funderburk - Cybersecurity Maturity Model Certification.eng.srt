1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,120
okay um and um if someone i guess you

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,559
can hear me okay because you sent a chat

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,080
to the box great so we'll start the

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,559
presentation this is the cmc overview

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,000
and this is tailored for security

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,920
professionals and and the main things

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
that i think security professionals need

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,960
to know about cmmc

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,960
the um

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,720
the the one of the reasons we're doing

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,640
this is because america spends billions

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,039
of dollars developing weapon systems

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,960
and it's taken years to develop these

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,559
weapons systems and all the the

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,800
different technologies that are needed

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,640
and other countries shortcut that

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,559
process by stealing the intellectual

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,160
property that we use

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
to create our weapon systems so um this

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,120
is an example

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,879
one of these is the america f-35 joint

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,239
strike fighter

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,000
and the other one is built by another

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
country which one is the american

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,480
version

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,120
can you all unbeaten some some

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,879
i tell tell me which is the american

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,040
version

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,280
both

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,200
not correct

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
one is built by another country

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
bro one's built by china

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,759
which one

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,840
yang

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,960
the top pitcher the bottom pitcher

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,200
top picture

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,520
the top picture you're correct

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,159
uh because the u.s air force logo is on

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,880
the bottom picture and uh but other than

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,799
that they're pretty close

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,200
and china was able to accomplish this

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,880
you know building this so quickly

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,320
because they were able to steal the

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
technology uh on how the airplanes are

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,479
built

46
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,399
and the

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,640
you hear in the news when there's when

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,479
there's classified information that's

49
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,200
stolen um you tend to hear that in the

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,079
news

51
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,000
um but actually that's

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,479
you know it doesn't happen a whole lot

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,880
um the classified systems are actually

54
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,119
protected pretty well and that's usually

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,479
like a human

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,319
did something

57
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,959
um that took the classified information

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,440
and gave it to the foreign adversary

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,800
but there's tons of theft from

60
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,760
non-classified data from military

61
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,280
contractors

62
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,920
and this is not necessarily from a human

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,760
you know giving the adversary the

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,239
information this is them um going

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,720
through the cyber defenses to get the

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,400
information

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,480
and it's the supply chain

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
because a lot of this data that's not

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
classified isn't being protected as well

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,319
as it should be and that's what's

71
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,920
allowing the foreign adversaries to

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,319
steal it so so most of the classified

73
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,000
information because it's protected so

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,800
well it is a human you know giving that

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,560
information to the foreign adversary

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,879
when the classified data gets stolen but

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,000
for the unclassified data um it's it's

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,480
they're able to use tools and techniques

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
in order to extract the data and that's

80
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,840
where a vast majority of the data is is

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,519
leaving um

82
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,959
the country

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,120
and so you know example is the company i

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,239
work for

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,120
you know we're building uh army um

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,440
propellants this is for our propellants

87
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,480
for though for weapon systems and all of

88
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,400
this data is unclassified everything

89
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,000
that we're doing

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,480
to build this army ammunition plant no

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,400
classified data on there and of course

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
we talk about on our website what we're

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,040
doing

94
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,319
and another example is missile silos and

95
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,159
so again this is public information on

96
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,400
our public facing website that we're

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
doing um

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,159
construction of underground nuclear

99
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,400
weapons storage and handling facilities

100
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,959
at the fe warren uh base in cheyenne

101
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,319
wyoming

102
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,480
so this is an example of you know two

103
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,879
weapon systems projects that we're doing

104
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,720
but these are totally unclassified

105
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
projects that we're working on and so

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,319
there is expectations of the government

107
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,560
for how we're protecting the data but um

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,400
but this is this is where the big

109
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,040
shortcoming has been and that's why the

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,319
department of defense feels like they

111
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,400
need to implement a more formal program

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,319
on how to protect the data

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,040
and so that is what the goal of the cmmc

114
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,639
project is

115
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,199
and this is the cyber security maturity

116
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,040
model certification is what it stands

117
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,839
for

118
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,680
this is actually not coming from the i.t

119
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,520
department at the pentagon this is

120
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,800
coming from the supply chain

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,600
section of the pentagon and so the um

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,400
the

123
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,000
office of the under secretary of defense

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
for acquisition and sustainment is

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,840
actually putting the certification model

126
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,199
in place to help protect government data

127
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,880
in the supply chain

128
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,639
so their goal is

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,880
they they don't want if you get

130
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,080
you know if you need to if you're

131
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
building

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,000
a

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,040
airplane and you need a component built

134
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,120
for that airplane they don't want you to

135
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,720
send the drawings for the entire

136
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
airplane to the subcontractor that's

137
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,440
going to build a component for you they

138
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,320
want you to only send the information

139
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,080
that's required

140
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,039
and and that's it takes effort for for

141
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,759
the

142
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,240
contractor to to carve out the work and

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,840
only send the information that's

144
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,039
required to do the the task at hand but

145
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,120
that is a major part of cmmc is having

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,360
you segment your data that only provide

147
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,199
to subcontractors the exact data that

148
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,120
they need and they also want you to make

149
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
sure your subcontractors are protecting

150
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,280
the data too so the same level that you

151
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,440
as a prime contractor are protecting the

152
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,880
data there's an expectation that the

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
subcontractor is protecting it the same

154
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,440
way

155
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,400
and so it's it's been um there's been

156
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,479
some things in place over the evolution

157
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,759
through the years

158
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,880
and so there's um something called cui

159
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,759
that's a new um

160
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,840
data

161
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,560
um i can't think of the word

162
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,639
classification how do you classify the

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,000
data

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,960
if you've heard of ouo

165
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,800
official use only or if you've heard of

166
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,039
it was replaced with f-o-u-o for

167
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,199
official use only but those were kind of

168
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,120
broad terms and that that's where we

169
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,000
started and now we're at cui and it has

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
um international traffic and arms

171
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
regulation and export controlled

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
information and so that means basically

173
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,680
only americans can see it

174
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,840
and that's that's basically the control

175
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,400
only only americans are u.s persons

176
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,160
sorry can see the data but how you

177
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,319
protect it's not defined they just say

178
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,120
you know only u.s persons can see it

179
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,280
so then they came out with a standard

180
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
and said okay for nist 800-171 this is a

181
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,479
government agency that publishes

182
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,400
standards and so the department of

183
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
defense said well you have to follow

184
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,960
nist 800-171

185
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,880
when you're protecting our data

186
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,120
and but it's on the honor system

187
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,000
and so you self attest

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,880
hey i am following this

189
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
800-171

190
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,599
and then they came out with a clause for

191
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,880
a contract and um the dfar means defense

192
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,960
federal acquisition register and they

193
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,520
came out with the clause um 252.204.712

194
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,759
and that ones that re that requires you

195
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,280
contractually to do the nest 800 171 and

196
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,759
they can come choose to automate you

197
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,840
um on whether you're meeting it or not

198
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,199
but the problem is the department of

199
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,199
defense doesn't have a lot of auditors

200
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,039
they don't have a lot of people that can

201
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,080
do this

202
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,880
so our company has been audited one time

203
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,919
against this standard and um and that's

204
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,280
just you know they just don't have

205
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,039
enough people to go around or enough

206
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,440
budget or enough experts to go around to

207
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
to audit all the companies

208
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,120
and so what what the this new cmmc is as

209
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,599
a new default requirement that was put

210
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,160
into the first contracts this year

211
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,840
and it was just a handful of contracts

212
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,560
this year it's going to grow to

213
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,080
more next year and then more the year

214
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,479
after and this is where the cmmc

215
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,560
accreditation comes in and the

216
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,000
difference from what's been done in the

217
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,280
past is um third parties will be coming

218
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,520
in to to assess you with the cmc

219
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
accreditation so instead of the u.s

220
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,440
government doing it like they did with

221
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,520
the 800 or 171

222
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,199
with cmmc you will hire a third party to

223
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,039
come in and do the assessment and then

224
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,800
that third party will tell the us

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,560
government how you did so that's that's

226
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
this is the evolution of how we got to

227
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,319
where we are now

228
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,720
there's five different levels of cmmc

229
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,879
and the level depends on the type of

230
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,840
data that you're going to be um working

231
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,719
with

232
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,958
and so if you just have commercial off

233
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,958
the self projects things you're just

234
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
buying there is no cmc requirement for

235
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,399
that that's the far left-hand side of

236
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,919
the graph

237
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,240
for level one this is if you're going to

238
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,519
receive an rfp

239
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,440
special data

240
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,640
okay

241
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,120
so for level one this is when you're

242
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,519
going to be building something for for

243
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,279
the government or doing something

244
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,160
you know

245
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,839
um there was something that's not off

246
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,839
the shelf and so you're going to get a

247
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,000
um a contract saying these are our

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
contract requirements and this is what

249
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,120
we need you to do to fulfill those

250
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
requirements that's what level one is

251
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,279
and that is a federal contract

252
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,800
information

253
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,120
for level three this is the controlled

254
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
unclassified information

255
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,760
that's o-u-o f-o-u-o export control

256
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,240
weapon systems type stuff

257
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,839
actually weapon systems comes in level

258
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,800
four

259
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,200
but level three is is the um the data

260
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,640
that the government wants the minimum

261
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
protections for and then level four and

262
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
five is for the weapon systems and so

263
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,160
that's the the different levels of

264
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,200
data so it depends on the data you gotta

265
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,080
have

266
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
as to the protections and and the cmc

267
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,160
level of certification that you have to

268
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,600
achieve

269
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
and so for the accreditation process

270
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,920
level one is a questionnaire

271
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,600
that you have to fill out there's 17

272
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
controls you have to meet

273
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,880
and then um an assessor will

274
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
look at the answers to your questions

275
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,240
and and give you a level one and then

276
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,399
there's up to a year for someone the

277
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,079
government will send someone to come to

278
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,399
your company within a year to to

279
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,000
validate that you meet the level one

280
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,079
controls

281
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,839
for level three four and five you have

282
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,160
to hire a company to come in and do an

283
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,560
assessment of you and you have to pass

284
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,720
that assessment before you're given the

285
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,480
level 345

286
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,959
approval to operate

287
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,040
and these are the department of defense

288
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,959
estimates of the number of companies

289
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,160
that are going to receive these

290
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,519
accreditations

291
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,160
so they're anticipating 28 000 will

292
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,839
receive a level one

293
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,079
and they're anticipating 14 000 will get

294
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,360
the level three

295
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,800
and um

296
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,120
about 50 to 60 companies will get the

297
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
level 4 and level 5.

298
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,120
so again level 4 and level 5 is not

299
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,519
classified so when i say weapon systems

300
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,920
that doesn't mean classified i gave you

301
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,640
examples earlier in the presentation of

302
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,480
work my company's doing it's not

303
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,880
classified so um so again it's it's

304
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
unclassified data but still has to do

305
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,839
with weapon systems

306
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,040
and for level two um the level two is

307
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,360
companies that tried to get to a level

308
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
three and didn't make it

309
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,000
and so

310
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,480
they they attempted to get to a level

311
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
three and those companies would be

312
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,519
awarded level two

313
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,519
it doesn't mean that you can see the

314
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,200
data that's required for a level three

315
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,360
but it shows that you tried

316
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,399
and

317
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
there's companies that might be at a

318
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,640
level one and tell you hey we intend to

319
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,839
be a level three well they probably

320
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,200
don't um otherwise they wouldn't have

321
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,120
done the level one whereas if someone

322
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,800
does a level two that shows you that

323
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,120
they tried but there was a gap and

324
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,399
they're going to tell you that you know

325
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,480
they're trying to fill that gap

326
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,800
the important thing with cmc to remember

327
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,880
is you don't have to be at the level

328
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
during the proposal phase

329
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
you have to be at the level to do the

330
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,399
work

331
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,639
and so you could actually not be a level

332
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,959
three and submit a proposal to do the

333
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,760
work

334
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,079
while you still work on closing your

335
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,399
gaps to achieve a level three but if

336
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,720
they make the award and your company

337
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,959
wins the award you have to be at the

338
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,600
level three in order to to to do the

339
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
award to do the work

340
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,880
and some procurements you know it could

341
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
take six months some takes nine months

342
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,120
so so it does take a while

343
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,760
for you to get an rfp and see what level

344
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,760
you need to be at and then there's time

345
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,519
where you prepare your proposal and then

346
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,800
there's time for the government to

347
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,120
evaluate the proposal there may even be

348
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,360
a protest period so there is a there is

349
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
a time gap where companies do have a

350
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,600
chance to to get up to a certain level

351
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,720
this is very important when you're

352
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,200
talking about

353
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,079
contracts

354
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,720
because if you're a company

355
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
like my company and and we bid on level

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,480
three work again we typically don't do

357
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,560
everything ourselves we subcontract

358
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,320
things to other companies

359
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
and so we're going to have to

360
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
divide up the information and some of

361
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,639
the subcontractors will not need a

362
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,639
certification at all some will need a

363
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,000
level one and some will need a level

364
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
three and so as we look for

365
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,240
subcontractors you know of course it's

366
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,000
the least risky if we can find people

367
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that are already at a level three

368
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,839
but if they're not you know we we need

369
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,760
to have confidence that if they claim

370
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,959
they're going to get there and they can

371
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,560
demonstrate that they're working on it

372
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,000
and we can't include them as a

373
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
subcontractor in our proposal even

374
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,920
though they don't have a level three yet

375
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
um and

376
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,560
you know with their assurances that

377
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,920
they're going to get there by the time

378
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,320
the contract's rewarded

379
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
so um so that's an important

380
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,000
differentiation you have to be at the

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,240
level at the time of award not at the

382
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,360
time of proposal

383
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
foot certification process

384
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
again on level one that's the

385
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,440
questionnaire that you fill out and you

386
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,519
can engage something called a registered

387
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,440
provider organization

388
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,199
in order to help you with the

389
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,600
questionnaire and the 17 controls to

390
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,519
help determine if you're meeting those

391
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,920
controls or what you need to do to meet

392
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,440
those controls

393
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,959
and then um

394
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,199
someone will review your responses and

395
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,079
then

396
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,199
you'll have a site visit within 365 days

397
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,800
and then the department of defense will

398
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,959
place the cmc level in the supplier

399
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,440
performance risk system

400
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,839
and for the level three four or five

401
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,199
a dod contractor can engage a registered

402
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,600
provider organization an rpo we're going

403
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,120
to talk about that in a minute and

404
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,639
that's the company that helps you

405
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,360
prepare for the cmmc assessment so they

406
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,680
come in and they they look at you and

407
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,600
tell you if you're ready and tell you

408
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,760
what gaps you have

409
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,120
and then when you get those gaps filled

410
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,160
you can hire a different company that

411
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,480
actually does the accreditation for you

412
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,360
and that's called a

413
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,920
c3pao

414
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,079
and that is the certified third-party

415
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,120
assessor organization and this does have

416
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,279
to be two different companies you can't

417
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,519
use the same company to do your gap

418
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,920
analysis that you do to do your actual

419
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,680
assessment assessment it has to be two

420
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,279
different companies

421
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,320
and then if you pass then the c3pa will

422
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,040
provide a copy of that to your cmmc

423
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,480
level to the department of defense and

424
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,720
that's placed in the supplier

425
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,279
performance risk system

426
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,680
one of one of the gaps we have right now

427
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,120
is that

428
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,160
we can't look inside the supplier

429
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,759
performance risk system

430
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,600
and so we have to rely on a

431
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,480
subcontractor telling us what their cmmc

432
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,800
rating is we currently don't have a way

433
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,560
to look it up ourselves

434
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,440
um hopefully when cmc gets a little bit

435
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,600
more mature that'll be that'll be

436
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,680
changed but for right now we just have

437
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,279
to trust somebody when they tell us what

438
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,519
they are this is a turn in the proposal

439
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,399
phase

440
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,480
now when the award is actually made and

441
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,839
you say okay these are the

442
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,240
subcontractors i'm planning to use the

443
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,000
government will tell you at time of

444
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,880
award oh by the way company b didn't get

445
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,600
their level three certification and um

446
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,639
but but you know right now

447
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,320
the way that things are based right now

448
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,519
it's kind of we just have to go with

449
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,839
what our subcontractors are telling us

450
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,519
we don't have a way to independently

451
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,880
verify it

452
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,279
the government can verify that west is a

453
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,120
subcontractor camp but hopefully that

454
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,800
that's a gap that'll figure out a way to

455
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,079
get around

456
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,320
to make that better

457
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,000
so

458
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,360
a third

459
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,320
uh

460
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,360
non-profit accreditation body was formed

461
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,440
as because the department of defense

462
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,360
didn't want to manage all this

463
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,600
themselves so the department of defense

464
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
is publishing like the kind of the

465
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,959
requirements that you get a

466
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,360
certification but they're not defining

467
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,519
what the certification is

468
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,160
and so there's a third party uh company

469
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,079
that was formed a non-profit that was

470
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,600
formed and this is the company that's

471
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,360
putting together

472
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
how to do

473
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,880
the assessments and how to how to

474
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,280
determine if you're meeting the again

475
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,039
it's based on the nist controls but they

476
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,959
also added

477
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,039
some controls too it's not 100 nest

478
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,880
controls they've added some beyond this

479
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,160
controls too and this agency is the one

480
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,799
that has the program to

481
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,959
get the companies that are doing the

482
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,480
assessments and getting the companies

483
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,240
that are doing the preparation or the

484
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,319
gap analysis and getting the

485
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,280
certification test put in place

486
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,240
for the people to pass it so this is the

487
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,400
main website it's called the cmmc

488
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,360
accreditation body or cmmcab

489
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,760
and we're going to go through

490
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,520
some of the different things that they

491
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,760
have available on their website

492
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,799
and so

493
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,360
this has a list of the c3pao which is

494
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,960
the assessors

495
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,039
this is those companies that have the

496
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,240
assessors

497
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
and then the next block is actual

498
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
assessors themselves

499
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,000
the next circle is the register provider

500
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
organizations these are the ones that do

501
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
the gap analysis for you

502
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,120
and then the next block is the

503
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,280
registered practitioners themselves

504
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
these are the people that

505
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,919
the people that work for the assessor

506
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,520
company i'm sorry the gap analysis

507
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,320
companies that will come to your site

508
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,679
and then

509
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,200
these are the organizations that are

510
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,679
seeking the certification and then these

511
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,440
are the training partners these are the

512
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,919
companies that have the training that

513
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,919
you need to take in order to become a

514
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,520
registered practitioner or an accessor

515
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,440
there's also a marketplace link up here

516
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,760
and at the marketplace link you can find

517
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,400
the companies that are um that are that

518
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,720
are meet these requirements

519
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,000
so let's go dive a little bit deeper in

520
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,760
so the registry provider organization

521
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,400
um the block that i've highlighted these

522
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,160
are the companies that will do the gap

523
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,679
analysis for you

524
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,360
so they will come in and look at your

525
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,440
environment and see if you're meeting

526
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,480
the

527
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,160
requirements meeting the nest

528
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,760
requirements

529
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,720
and again you can go to the marketplace

530
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,480
tab and get a list of the registered

531
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,559
provider organizations and then you work

532
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,000
with them in order to to put a

533
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,080
agreement a place for them to come in

534
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,120
and do a gap analysis for you

535
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,520
and the people that work

536
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,480
for

537
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,679
the registered provider organizations

538
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,760
are called registered practitioners

539
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,919
and so these these are the people that

540
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,320
work for the registered provider

541
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,919
organizations

542
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,600
and there's a certification they have to

543
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,559
go through

544
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,919
there's there's training they have to

545
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,440
take and there's a test they have to

546
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
take in order to become a registered

547
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,080
practitioner keep your accreditation up

548
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,080
to date so again these are the people

549
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,559
that come in and do the gap analysis and

550
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,039
look at the companies and tell them you

551
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,720
know if if

552
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,440
they feel like um you know according to

553
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,080
this test

554
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,880
criteria that's been provided the

555
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,760
this accreditation body has provided use

556
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,280
and they're the ones who are supposed to

557
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,320
tell you if you're ready to go through

558
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,039
the certification process

559
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,280
so these

560
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,679
the the register providers

561
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,360
have to pass the commercial background

562
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,159
check

563
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,679
they have to complete the online

564
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,600
training they must sign a professional

565
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
code of conduct and again an annual fee

566
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,240
that they have to provide

567
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,039
so

568
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,400
they need lots of security professionals

569
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,320
you know in order to do these gap

570
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
analysis because again these people are

571
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,880
also the ones um you know there's going

572
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,320
to be a lot of preparation that the

573
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
companies are going to need to do and so

574
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,320
there's going to need to have a lot of

575
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,760
rpos

576
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,840
and this is the kind of the entry level

577
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,679
um to this this is this is kind of the

578
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,600
easiest one to get because you're just

579
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,440
doing the gap analysis

580
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,280
so again this is the the registered

581
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,120
practitioners and these are the people

582
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,760
that work for the

583
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,200
registered provider organizations to do

584
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,480
the gap now

585
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,039
so now we're going to move on to

586
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,919
the these are the third party assessor

587
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,480
organizations again 3pao

588
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,000
these are the companies that actually do

589
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,640
the accreditation for you and the people

590
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,000
that work for c3pas paos are the

591
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
assessors

592
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,840
and there's different levels of

593
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,960
assessors and so there's four different

594
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,159
levels

595
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,120
the entry one is a certified cbmc

596
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,799
professional

597
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,559
as a member of the team

598
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,039
they're not they're not actually able to

599
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,240
to sign off themselves

600
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,039
and

601
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,760
when they send a testers to your company

602
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,000
they send a team of people and they're

603
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,039
eligible to be a member of the team

604
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,880
when they get some more experience they

605
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,480
can then go to the second column where

606
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,720
their certified assessor at level one

607
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,080
and they're able to look at those

608
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,000
questionnaires that companies filled out

609
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,640
and they're able to determine based on

610
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
those questionnaires if a company is

611
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,559
able to be given a level one

612
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,240
certification or not

613
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,600
they're also able to participate

614
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,580
um in the other

615
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,880
[Music]

616
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,159
level three

617
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,080
ones again as the member of a team

618
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,320
the next one over is a level three

619
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,039
assessor and they're able to conduct

620
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,440
assessors at the um

621
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,760
at the level one and the level three

622
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
and and so they have experience required

623
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,080
to actually pass you on the level three

624
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,360
certification

625
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,039
and then going up there's a certified

626
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,400
assessor level five

627
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,240
and they're able to to assess you at

628
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
level four and level five and say that

629
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,840
you passed the criteria to be at the

630
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,440
level four and level five

631
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,840
so there's five different positions um

632
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,440
there's four on this slide that talks

633
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
about the assessors and then the one we

634
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,520
talked about previously that was the

635
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,280
registered practitioner which is again

636
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,520
the one that does the gap analysis

637
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,840
so the you know this is where they need

638
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,960
hundreds and hundreds of people that

639
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,080
understand how to do the gap analysis

640
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,320
and how to do the assessments in order

641
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,158
to help make this program successful

642
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,200
and this is the marketplace where you

643
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,360
can go look companies up and so you can

644
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,400
come and see well who are the registered

645
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,320
provider companies

646
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,200
who are the registered practitioners who

647
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,159
are the

648
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,720
c3pa assessment companies so you can

649
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,960
come to this marketplace and look up

650
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,480
companies and see

651
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,679
who they are

652
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,520
so this is an example from a screenshot

653
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,039
of the

654
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,080
some c-3paos

655
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,360
it actually lists the company

656
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,440
information on here and then

657
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
there's more companies now

658
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,600
it changes weekly

659
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
but these are the these are like three

660
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,679
of the companies that are able to do

661
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,120
level three assessments they've

662
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,320
completed

663
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,480
everything that they need to do in order

664
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,039
to do a level three certification

665
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,960
and so these companies actually had to

666
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,679
be

667
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,679
approved by the us government and so the

668
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,279
us government agency that came to my

669
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,520
company a couple years ago and did our

670
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,440
nist 800 171 assessment that same agency

671
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,320
is the one that did these companies

672
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,799
but again with it with the dod they do

673
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,799
one assessment of redstone or one

674
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,120
assessment of cash

675
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,600
or credit gratos and then these

676
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,840
companies are able to go assess other

677
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,880
companies

678
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,799
so this is a way again the department of

679
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,200
defense isn't having to expend all this

680
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,679
manpower they expand the manpower

681
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,360
getting these commercial companies able

682
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
to do the assessments and then these

683
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,279
commercial companies will go off and do

684
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,960
hundreds of other companies themselves

685
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,960
um

686
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,200
but this is still a work in progress

687
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
it's not um it's not you know 100 ready

688
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,919
yet the training is one of the things

689
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,840
that's you know you know coming out

690
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,159
they've had provisional training um in

691
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,320
the past and this is for the uh

692
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,159
registered practitioners but they're

693
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,760
they're just coming out now with the

694
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,240
final with the final training and so you

695
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,520
know this is a warning that you know

696
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,000
be careful that you don't get tricked

697
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,799
into paying for classes

698
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,440
because it wasn't ready yet the dod is

699
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,200
still working to finalize the course

700
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,440
objectives so someone might tell you

701
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,000
they're offering cmc training but it's

702
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,679
just you know it's just kind of what

703
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,960
they came up with it's not the

704
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
authorized training yet

705
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,480
and um so the last thing um the last

706
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,760
town hall i attended they said october

707
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,000
is when they hope to have this training

708
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,200
um out and ready uh but you can see that

709
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,039
you know that the um

710
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,640
they have the registered provider

711
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,919
training out

712
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,159
um but it's not it's for the assessors

713
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,440
that they don't have the training out

714
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,039
yet and so they're just there's again

715
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,480
this is still a program that's under

716
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
development

717
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
and um

718
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,760
they have town hall the cmmc advisory

719
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,600
board that's how town hall meetings on

720
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,960
the last tuesday of every month

721
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,440
to get you give you a status of where

722
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
you're at and they also have replays of

723
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,320
previous town halls and so if you go to

724
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,279
the um to the cmmc website here one of

725
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,000
the links is um town halls where you can

726
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,039
go and

727
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,840
hear the previous town hall meetings

728
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,600
and this is a projected rollout from the

729
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,279
department of defense they are behind

730
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,400
schedule

731
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,640
the biden administration decided to do a

732
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,480
review of the program and so they put up

733
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,919
a pause on rolling out any new rfes

734
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,919
and that that assessment is still

735
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,600
underway

736
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,520
on whether the crmc program is going to

737
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,279
be rolled out the the way it was

738
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,880
designed and so the buying

739
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,400
administration is looking at the whole

740
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,799
program top to bottom and they may make

741
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,080
changes in it um but before it rolls out

742
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,960
any further so that review is underway

743
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,039
and so there haven't been any new

744
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,440
uh rfps

745
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,919
so where they had 15 and fiscal year

746
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,720
2021 they did not achieve that goal um

747
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,480
because um you know halfway through the

748
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,919
fiscal year there was an administration

749
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,080
change that put a hold on rolling out

750
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,480
anything else for cmmc so the

751
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,120
accreditation board is still working to

752
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,960
get the test ready and getting all the

753
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,919
assessors ready um because again assess

754
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,399
the cmc a b is a separate non-profit

755
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,240
entity so they're still doing

756
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,480
their part to get ready for everything

757
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,880
um the part that's on hold is this the

758
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,279
department of defense actually putting

759
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,480
um

760
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,279
cmfc in new rfps they're not doing that

761
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,640
right now

762
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,080
until they decide if they want to change

763
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,919
anything as the program was designed

764
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,919
under the previous administration um

765
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,480
there could be changes um to how they do

766
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,120
it

767
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,760
an example for instance is um with level

768
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,720
one um they can be very expensive for a

769
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,320
small company to meet level one

770
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,360
requirements and you know there's you

771
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,840
know obviously complaints about that

772
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,120
expense

773
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,520
and so one of the big questions is well

774
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,399
does a level one company actually need

775
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,880
you know an assessor to do that on site

776
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,399
visit could they just review the

777
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,559
questionnaire only and not have to do

778
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,240
the on-site visit well with the previous

779
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,159
administration it was they have to do

780
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,520
the on-site visit

781
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,080
um there's a chance that the current

782
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,799
administration could change that and say

783
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,039
we'll take the questionnaire only and we

784
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,880
won't actually require the on-site visit

785
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,520
that's an example of a change that the

786
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,520
you know the new administration could do

787
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,840
that would have a huge cost impact on

788
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,840
the companies um that are that are

789
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,360
pursuing the level one that is a

790
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,200
tremendous cost impact difference

791
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,559
there's also a tremendous risk

792
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,760
difference too

793
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,120
on whether you just fill out a

794
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,640
questionnaire and you may or may not be

795
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,159
doing that stuff and if you know you're

796
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,320
not going to get an on-site assessment

797
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,480
yeah you might not worry about it but if

798
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,080
you if you know a company is going to

799
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,440
come visit you

800
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,600
and and validate you that your answers

801
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,200
to your questions are correct you know

802
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,480
there's going to be a higher level of

803
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,919
diligence that are you responding

804
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,520
correctly

805
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
and making sure that you're meeting the

806
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,720
requirements

807
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,279
so under the prior administration they

808
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,840
were adamant that there has to be an

809
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,159
on-site review in order to determine

810
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,320
companies are meeting the goals properly

811
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,080
and that those people aren't there

812
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,399
anymore and so there's a chance with

813
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,000
with the new administration that that

814
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,120
could change

815
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,159
and um

816
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,799
and there won't be um for instance level

817
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,200
one on site assessments so so everything

818
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,640
with the programs being reviewed right

819
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,240
now so what i'm presenting of course is

820
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,039
what the prior administration laid out

821
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,720
and um and this was the prior

822
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,279
administration's rollout plan and again

823
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,840
it shows again the number number of

824
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,039
companies so again you know 895 level

825
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,120
one companies rolling up to about um

826
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,440
fiscal year 25 28 000 level one

827
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,480
companies

828
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,159
and the these numbers um are the

829
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,559
cumulative as they grow to the right

830
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,799
and again it shows the difference

831
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,880
and um

832
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,440
and and and these are also again

833
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,399
subcontracts this is not prime contracts

834
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,080
from the government that these counts

835
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,960
are

836
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,080
um

837
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,799
these accounts are companies that do

838
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,480
this is multiple contracts i guess

839
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,840
that's what i'm trying to say

840
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,520
the um

841
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,240
so so the prime contracts are at the top

842
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,799
and so if you see for instance um in

843
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,159
fiscal year 25 they expect to have 479

844
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,480
prime contracts but they expect to have

845
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,840
47 000 contractors working on those 479

846
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,080
contracts so that just gives you

847
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,840
an idea of the tremendous scope that

848
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,360
when they award one contract to lockheed

849
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,399
martin

850
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,320
lockheed martin might have a you know

851
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,000
150 to 200 subcontractors or more um

852
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,320
doing work for one prime contract

853
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,399
and again so it's not as much that the

854
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,600
lucky martin that they're worried about

855
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,320
is the lucky martin's 200 subcontractors

856
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,000
where a lot of this leakage has taken

857
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,360
place out

858
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,399
okay so um we definitely need security

859
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,480
professionals you know in order to make

860
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,000
these things happen

861
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,080
and um the town hall that i mentioned

862
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,159
earlier you go to the cmmc advisory

863
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,039
board um you can see that view the town

864
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,480
hall videos that have been done in the

865
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,600
past

866
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,440
and um so lots of opportunities for

867
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,519
security professionals lots of need

868
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,799
for people to come in and do the

869
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,880
assessments and for people that come in

870
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,840
and do the the readiness gap analysis

871
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,480
so that's the end of my presentation

872
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,240
and uh

873
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,760
if anybody wants to take themselves off

874
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,880
me

875
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,679
and

876
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,480
i'm gonna ask a question

877
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,519

878
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000

i showed there's 20 participants

881
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,720

882
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,760
i'm one of those

883
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,039

comments if anybody wants to share any

912
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,840
information they know

913
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,120
mark one question i do have for you is

914
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,279
will there be less of a reliance on 800

915
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,080
171 as as the government transitions to

916
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,799
cmmc will that be the sole

917
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,158
governing requirements body there

918
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,760
well the

919
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,840
um it's the primary um

920
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,440
the the the requirements that they have

921
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,919
is primarily 800 171 and then they've

922
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,919
added 20 additional controls for level

923
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:06,960
3.

924
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,119
and so

925
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,800
i think it's going to remain the primary

926
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,399
thank you

927
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,760

970
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,920
there's four companies

971
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,440

972
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,200
required to do the assessment itself

973
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
if you want to look for companies to do

974
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,560

these are the ones that can do the gap

978
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,960
analysis

979
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,280
