1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,839
i wasn't complaining

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,280
for sure

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,080
so

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,440
all right well it looks like it's that

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,120
time so let's go and get started i

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,160
appreciate everybody for um coming to

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,920
the round table

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,160
for on ransomware uh i also see um

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,039
definitely want to thank of course the

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,480
the folks that are sitting on the panel

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,680
today so

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,000
a special thanks to ryan for pulling

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,519
everybody together

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,280
and this was was definitely his his

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
brainchild we're hoping for next year

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,680
we'll bring back the uh the round table

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,440
or the firing squad for the uh the

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,920
pintest firing squad um

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,480
but this was a very timely topic and and

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,920
builds off of uh chris's conversation uh

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,239
in his session earlier so uh we're gonna

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,480
assume that not everybody was able to

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,120
attend the session and and kind of start

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
over from scratch so

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,280
definitely if you weren't able to make

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,399
chris's

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,760
session earlier

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,640
and you are interested in

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,400
a better understanding of the landscape

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,080
and how to protect against

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
ransomware and

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,760
what that breach response process looks

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,479
like uh while we'll definitely touch on

34
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,640
a lot of that in in this session

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,479
i'm sure we won't get to all of those uh

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,240
aspects that he covered so definitely

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000

thanks for uh coming

83
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,840
so i thought we'd kick off

84
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,599
with just a general overview of how

85
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,680
everyone on the panel sees the

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,800
ransomware landscape today at a high

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
level and then and then we'll kind of be

88
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,280
digging in uh deeper as we go throughout

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,560
the conversation so i thought um

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,080
uh when we just go in order uh and uh

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,319
that we just did and uh kind of go from

92
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,840
there so ryan you want to give us uh

93
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,760
your thoughts at a high level on the

94
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,680
ransomware landscape today

95
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,440
from your perspective

96
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
yeah thanks mike i mean i think we can

97
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,080
all see that you know every week every

98
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,760
other week it feels like there's a new

99
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,599
new actor coming out to play you know

100
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,239
colonial pipeline back in may june time

101
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,440
frame really

102
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,840
really picked up i guess the press of

103
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,159
what was going on and we saw a lot

104
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,120
transpire after the whole colonial

105
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,760
pipeline incident dark side being taken

106
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,720
down

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,480
we've seen a lot of new threat actor

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,439
groups that have kind of splintered off

109
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,599
we've seen resurrected

110
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,560
threat actor groups come back

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
and they are they are out there and they

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,720
are trying to

113
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,640
i would say we saw a lull during the

114
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,959
summer i felt like for a lot of folks

115
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,280
there was kind of this lull in the july

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,279
august maybe even in the september time

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,160
frame

118
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,560
um but i know from from talking to folks

119
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,759
that there's been a significant uptick

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,280
over the past month and there's

121
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,800
projected to be

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,560
more going into november and december so

123
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
ransomware is as as real as ever for

124
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,360
folks and they are

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,639
they are out there making a lot of cash

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,800
chris

127
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
those are great points ryan and two

128
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
things that i that we're seeing change

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,800
uh in the landscape and kind of a pivot

130
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,600
one is the reluctancy of threat actors

131
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,759
to work with negotiators we're seeing

132
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,800
that uh

133
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
be become an increase we're also seeing

134
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,840
an increase in extortion tile attack so

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,680
a threat actor siphons your data off

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,280
instead of going through and encrypting

137
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
all of your devices they still put your

138
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,960
your data on dark web to compel you to

139
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
pay that way so that's a little bit of a

140
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
pivot and that's where i think things

141
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,560
are moving so

142
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
alex what are you saying yeah chris

143
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,000
that's a great point i was actually

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,160
going to echo that um i i've seen a real

145
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
uptick in the type of of attacks where

146
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,639
they are not actually encrypting systems

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,880
but they are they're sending emails to

148
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,320
the companies informing them that

149
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,919
they've excellent traded data and

150
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,280
they'll either publish it on the dark

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,039
web or have already done that uh in

152
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
exchange for ransom so definitely that's

153
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,919
definitely a new tactic and then you

154
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,600
know from the legal standpoint is

155
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,520
outside counsel we're obviously paying

156
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,440
attention to a lot of the guidance

157
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,800
that's come out from ofac and some of

158
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,880
the other regulators on on ransom

159
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,800
payments and clearly with with all the

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,919
headlines

161
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,080
clients are certainly paying attention

162
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,919
to this and just wanting to be more in

163
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,919
tune with with what what they can do and

164
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,199
what they can't do if they're hit with a

165
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,919
ransomware attack

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,319
yeah that transition really from you

167
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,080
know the more typical

168
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,160
encrypting your data to kind of holding

169
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,880
your your data ransom um is definitely

170
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,080
the trend that we've been seeing and

171
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,360
that's kind of difficult from a claims

172
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,120
perspective because you're looking at

173
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,639
coverage from

174
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,880
you know obviously when the insured is

175
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,319
completely down and their system is

176
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,680
encrypted yeah we need to pay to make

177
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,919
that but if if they have their data held

178
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,680
ransom that's okay we need to figure out

179
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
how valuable that is is that going to

180
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,440
affect day to day i mean beyond that you

181
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,600
look i remember not too long ago the

182
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,080
average ransom demand was 450 000 and

183
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
now it's we're starting at an average of

184
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,080
about 1.2 million so that completely

185
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
shifts the landscape and really has you

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,240
know the attention of the insurance side

187
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
for sure

188
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
you see inflation across the board in

189
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,919
all things apparently right

190
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,440
definitely

191
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,840
all right that makes sense you know when

192
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,440
especially chris when you when you were

193
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,160
talking you know this shift about you

194
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,000
know when we go from

195
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,680
uh you know encrypt to in in x-star to

196
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,360
um expel

197
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,319
and and extort you know i uh

198
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,919
some of you know that i you know teach

199
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,840
at greenville tech and greenville tech

200
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,720
got got hit about a year and a half ago

201
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
and i still don't have any background on

202
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,759
on the actual situation uh itself i can

203
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,759
only guess basically based off of what

204
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,400
i've read in in the press um but it

205
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,280
sounded like um you know the attackers

206
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,919
had had come in they probably sat on the

207
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,199
network for for quite some time um i

208
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,160
suspect probably through vpn device that

209
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
wasn't protected by multi-factor

210
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,520
authentication

211
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,170
and

212
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,280
[Music]

213
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,599
they took their time found all the

214
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,840
sensitive data the the crown jewels

215
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,520
exfiltrated everything

216
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,560
and then

217
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,360
came back and deployed

218
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,680
ransomware right so i think that the

219
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,520
school had thought it looked like a

220
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,919
traditional ransomware infection

221
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,520
and so once they cleaned that up they

222
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,400
thought

223
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
all was said and done

224
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
and was like hey look at us we stopped

225
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
the the big bad hackers

226
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,360
and then

227
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,199
announced to the world what what had

228
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,440
happened and and the attackers came back

229
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,639
and said

230
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,720
oh well no we just didn't deploy

231
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,479
ransomware and you're right we stole all

232
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,720
of your information we took terabytes of

233
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,599
data in fact here's the w-2 for the

234
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,680
school president and here's the w-2 for

235
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
your cfo

236
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,599
and

237
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,460
have that conversation again

238
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,720
[Music]

239
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,440
so

240
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,520
obviously not a conversation anybody

241
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,360
wants to have but

242
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,560
in the different

243
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,559
cases that you guys work

244
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,799
you know what percentage

245
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,719
of those cases are more traditional

246
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,159
ransomware where it's just deploying

247
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,559
malware to encrypt files or systems

248
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,200
versus now the you know where we've seen

249
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,880
that shift to

250
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
not only encrypting systems but

251
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,959
exfiltrating data in

252
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,279
and blackmailing to

253
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,800
the uh targets

254
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,640
you may want to take that one

255
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
what about you chris

256
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,839
yeah i'll go first so uh it's rare for

257
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,200
us to see a case where they're not

258
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,360
exfiltrating data right that it's rare

259
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,800
for us to see someone come in and just

260
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,480
encrypt the environment and hope you pay

261
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,880
like they have this other um

262
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
aspect to to to compel you to pay and

263
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,800
that's what they do so i would say over

264
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,640
the last six months i can't think of one

265
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
what where we worked that they they

266
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,120
didn't expel data so and most that's

267
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,640
going to dark web as well right i would

268
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
say at least 80 percent once they get

269
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,760
data out it's on the dark web they're

270
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,240
not just saying emailing you and telling

271
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,440
you that we've got your data they're

272
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,720
putting it out for the whole world to

273
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,839
see

274
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,640
right yeah what about you alex yeah i

275
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,480
would agree with that i'd say 12 to 18

276
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,800
months ago there there might be a 50 50

277
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,240
split as to whether there was excel

278
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
tradition or not in addition to

279
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,160
encryption but now it's i would say it's

280
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
four out of five cases that i have where

281
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,839
there's there's definitely signs of

282
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,600
excellation and then to chris's point

283
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,519
you know the overwhelming majority of

284
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,279
those end up having data that's

285
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,320
published on the dark web

286
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,000
i said it's the really simple the simple

287
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
fact that they know that sometimes you

288
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,519
know a victim will have backups and be

289
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,360
able to restore from that but that's not

290
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,279
a factor if they just have your data

291
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,720
they know that they are going to get

292
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,120
paid for that so i mean it's it's kind

293
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,519
of an obvious next step or evolution of

294
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,279
these attacks that they would you know

295
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,399
be focusing more on the exfil yeah

296
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,320
definitely there's always that

297
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,240
what where's the next evolution coming

298
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,680
from i know i was reading yesterday

299
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,480
about um a group going through you know

300
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,600
once during the environment they're

301
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
scanning for vulnerabilities on systems

302
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,640
they're talking about finding

303
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,720
vulnerabilities and unpatched vmware

304
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,200
servers and then launching a python

305
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,480
script to

306
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
shut down all of your vms and then they

307
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,519
go back and they encrypt all of your vms

308
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,560
so now not only are you losing files but

309
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,959
you're losing those entire systems and

310
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,760
in the blink of an eye

311
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,320
about you ryan yeah i would think

312
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,800
so two two things i think so

313
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
we've obviously kind of what chris

314
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,680
mentioned is

315
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,560
is threat actors really

316
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,800
kind of being i see more bold and

317
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,040
audacious and and saying that if you

318
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
engage a negotiator

319
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,240
um that they will just you know flat out

320
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,839
publish your data

321
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,839
um you know we got to remember we're

322
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,160
dealing with criminals here and

323
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,360
you know i had a colleague who would

324
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,480
always say whatever's coming out of

325
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
their mouth is is a lie so

326
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,079
they say they're not going to publish it

327
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,760
they may not publish it right away but

328
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,240
down the road it's likely to get sold

329
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,680
um so you obviously need to be

330
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,959
monitoring

331
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,720
you know the dark web paste spin

332
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,480
whatever it may be after you go through

333
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,560
an incident like that i mean i think

334
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,399
that's a great point where council can

335
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,240
come in and really advise on what your

336
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,160
potential legal risks are

337
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,000
um alex obviously can talk to that and

338
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,680
we had mentioned earlier about kind of

339
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,920
data for classification and data mapping

340
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,120
and such but

341
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,560
you know i think the other point mike

342
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,760
you mentioned is obviously that

343
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,440
encryption of

344
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,240
whether it's vmdk files really going

345
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,720
after the backups as well

346
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,040
most backup systems you know whether

347
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,120
it's you know veeam netapp whatever

348
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,560
you're using

349
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,959
you know a lot of people think those are

350
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,600
hardened systems and often more often

351
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,560
than not they are are really unsecured

352
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,440
and are easy targets for

353
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,079
bad guys to get in and encrypt the

354
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,320
library files and the index files that

355
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
you would need to actually make a

356
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,399
restore

357
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,320
and once that happens people think their

358
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,480
their golden ticket out of a a problem

359
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,519
has really

360
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,040
you know gone up in ashes

361
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,560
yes i have a couple follow-up questions

362
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
there but before i kind of go down

363
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,519
that rabbit hole i thought because we

364
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,560
only have a

365
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,079
short amount of

366
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,800
time with everybody so i thought we kind

367
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,160
of go to the

368
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,680
get the biggest bang for our buck and

369
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,720
want to go around real quickly and

370
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
visit with everybody and get your idea

371
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,200
what's the one thing that you believe

372
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,440
organizations should know

373
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,800
about

374
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,279
defending against ransomware

375
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,800
chris you want to start us off with that

376
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,920
one

377
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,279
yeah that's a huge question um so uh

378
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,600
there's so many things one one thing for

379
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,480
right now my mind is blowing right now

380
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,680
the biggest thing i would say you've got

381
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,800
to be this tall to get on the right

382
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,160
you've got to have multi-factor right

383
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,519
you've got to be doing multi-factor on

384
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,480
your vpn you've got to be doing

385
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,880
multi-factor on your email you've got to

386
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,560
be doing multi-factor everywhere if i

387
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
could go out and coach everyone and give

388
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
them multi-factor tomorrow my caseload

389
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
would drop and i would be able to have

390
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,519
more cocktails it would be amazing um

391
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,200
but yeah i think multi-factors is the

392
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,920
biggest issue that we've seen

393
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,440
definitely i mean that's a great point i

394
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,360
think i think again i don't have that

395
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,880
background information that but that

396
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
probably would have saved the save that

397
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,399
school

398
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,639
and i i've definitely talked with others

399
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,639
that have been organizations where you

400
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,600
know attackers came through vpns and uh

401
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,360
yeah multi-factor would have would have

402
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,600
saved them so definitely without doubt

403
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,279
and other types of breaches right not

404
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,639
just ransomware so great

405
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,720
i think another

406
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
i i think i'm going to piggyback on that

407
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,120
so if you if you've got multi-factor

408
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
down and in place i'm going to say the

409
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
next next probably thing you're going to

410
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,920
want to have in place is it is a solid

411
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,720
edr solution you know

412
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,480
we have one as a sponsor they're

413
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,800
probably one of my favorite um there's

414
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
others out there

415
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
you obviously as an organization have to

416
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,639
figure out what is is best and most

417
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,880
economical for you

418
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,800
and adam can talk to this about you know

419
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,720
what they do from a coverage perspective

420
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
if there's a loss claim or whatever but

421
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,880
mfa and edr are two of the leading

422
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,279
controls that insurers are looking at so

423
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,959
there's others but i know those are two

424
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,000
big ones

425
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,680
yeah it's the first question i ask when

426
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
i have a new matter come in and i can't

427
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,120
tell you how many times like you know

428
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,880
you asked do you have mfa implemented

429
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,800
and as well yeah we do on all devices

430
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,120
like except for this one and that's the

431
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
one where you know it all started for um

432
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,360
of course so kind of making sure you're

433
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,720
going through and diligently monitoring

434
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,760
making sure everyone has that

435
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,680
implemented and i guess one thing i

436
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,000
would add is you know everyone

437
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,680
has a backup system in place but you

438
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,839
need to test those backups make sure you

439
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,279
kind of run through a fire drill and be

440
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,959
like okay if we were hit with a

441
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,360
situation could we restore um you know

442
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
just having the backups and testing it

443
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
are two different things so i think that

444
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,360
kind of separates and insured into a

445
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,199
different category if they're regularly

446
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,120
okay if we needed to right now could we

447
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,759
restore our system from backups

448
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,560
right

449
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,399
yeah definitely going going through

450
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,759
those steps making sure that they're

451
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,160
working making sure our team members

452
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,920
understand those processes and they can

453
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,480
do it as quickly as possible and

454
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,000
and you don't want to get you know run

455
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,839
around with the chicken with the the

456
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,920
your head cut off when in the middle of

457
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,759
a response trying to restore and then

458
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,120
find out you don't have the data you

459
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,360
thought you did or you have team members

460
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,040
that don't even know how to use the

461
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,079
restore function in in in the platform

462
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,920
so which i think we've oh yeah

463
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,839
and if you're not familiar with the

464
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,880
three two one model for backups

465
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,199
three copies of your data two mediums

466
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,519
and one offline you really probably

467
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,519
should familiarize yourself with that

468
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,120
and making sure you fully understand

469
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,000
your backup strategy um you know if you

470
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,199
are pulling something offline if

471
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,959
something is immutable

472
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,639
uh you know i have colleagues who will

473
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,320
say immutable backups are one of

474
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,560
probably the leading ways that if

475
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
you know your backup can't change after

476
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,120
a certain time for a certain period you

477
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
know that's a good indicator that you

478
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,199
may be able to do a solid restore

479
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,639
great i'll just i'll add something

480
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,320
outside of the the technical aspect of

481
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,600
this is

482
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,279
on the proactive side make sure in

483
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,199
addition to testing your backups

484
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,399
make sure you're doing a tabletop

485
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,720
exercise to test what what your incident

486
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,320
response team looks like in responding

487
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,000
to a ransomware attack you know do you

488
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,240
have certain protocols in place as to

489
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
how your it team is going to respond do

490
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,320
you do you understand what data you have

491
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,160
in certain locations have you classified

492
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,360
that and then

493
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,680
from from my perspective as outside

494
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,760
council and helping respond to this i

495
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,240
always recommend trying to to identify

496
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,000
who your vendors might be in responding

497
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
to an incident ahead of time and make

498
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,799
sure that you're getting those

499
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,720
engagements lined up because

500
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
if you get hit with an attack a time is

501
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,799
of the essence obviously and and the

502
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,400
more that you can identify and be

503
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,720
proactive and identify and in

504
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,919
identifying who's going to help you

505
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,760
respond whether that's outside counsel

506
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,679
forensic company uh crisis

507
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,080
communications firm whoever else uh the

508
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,679
more efficient you're going to be in

509
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,679
responding to something and defending

510
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,280
and mitigating the potential damage that

511
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
might result from that

512
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
yeah that's a great point we can kind of

513
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
build off of that when i think of

514
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,799
having even

515
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,080
something as

516
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,679
simple as as a retainer right how how

517
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,080
many of you work with clients that that

518
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,320
don't have ir retainers in place so when

519
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,640
they do get hit uh they're scrambling

520
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,440
around i know like for us at floor if if

521
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,840
we had an incident right knock on wood

522
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,080
and we didn't have a retainer in place

523
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
with an organization it probably would

524
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,280
take us two or three weeks to get all

525
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,760
the legal paperwork taken care of before

526
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,440
we could have somebody come in to

527
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,559
actually do the response

528
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,760
yeah i we see that a good bit too mike

529
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,320
and what i i like to recommend to is you

530
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,440
know negotiating with the fire

531
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,200
department on the front lawn when your

532
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,720
house is on fire right you want to have

533
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,640
that

534
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,799
situation in place beforehand and i

535
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,799
think it's really critical also you want

536
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,200
to have identified uh who your insurance

537
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,120
broker are who you should contact and

538
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,039
who counsel is right i go into these

539
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,880
rooms sometimes with a lot of it folks

540
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,559
and we're all very technical then we

541
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,080
start talking about what does it look

542
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,520
like if this thing has to go from an

543
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
incident to the the b word that ends

544
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,080
with reach like who gets to say that it

545
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,919
becomes the breach right and who how do

546
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,240
we deal with our clients at that point

547
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,320
and the technical folks we can talk to

548
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,000
you about technical all day but i don't

549
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,240
have a way to advise you on what this

550
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,400
means from a legal standpoint so having

551
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,559
either internal external counsel coming

552
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,840
into bios tonight has been really

553
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,760
critical

554
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
yeah definitely i mean that's great a

555
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,000
great point and we talk about instant

556
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,320
response and having you know kind of the

557
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,480
idea of those incident response teams

558
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,679
internally

559
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,840
um that also makes me and this is just

560
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,280
one of those questions that i'm more

561
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,240
curious about a personal perspective how

562
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,080
many organizations you know what

563
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,240
percentage of the engagements that that

564
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,559
everyone works with where there isn't

565
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,480
some type of formalized incident

566
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,039
response process or or formalized

567
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,679
incident response team

568
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,120
and they want to throw some numbers out

569
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,080
there

570
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,520
so so i i i'll take that i i think

571
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
it obviously depends on the size of the

572
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,480
organization your your more mature

573
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,840
organizations are obviously going to

574
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,320
have some type of irp i you know i would

575
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,160
challenge probably most mid-sized

576
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,120
organizations to pull that irp out on

577
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,679
monday and look in there and see where

578
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,840
step one or step two is call cyber

579
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,880
insurance um because if you know adam

580
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,799
can talk to this if you want you know

581
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,120
that claim potentially covered you've

582
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
got to engage them

583
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,280
really kind of out of the gate

584
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,200
and i feel like from the irp's i've

585
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,280
written and done

586
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,799
you know until i was kind of in the

587
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,360
space working with claims counsel and

588
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,799
claims coverage

589
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,200
really wasn't a consideration so

590
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,240
um and then obviously once you engage

591
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,000
claims council whether you're calling an

592
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,200
aig a chub whoever your your coverage is

593
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,760
you know council is going to get engaged

594
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,000
you know basically immediately once you

595
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
hit that hotline

596
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,919
um so

597
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,640
adam any comments on that and maybe yeah

598
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,320
alex if he's got anything

599
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,159
sure it's it's

600
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,280
you know when you're when you're facing

601
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,960
an incident it's not always your first

602
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,640
instinct to call

603
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
um call the insurance carrier you know

604
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,760
if there's a if your car is on fire or

605
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,520
anything the first index i need to call

606
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,240
geico right now but it's different in

607
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,559
the cyber world um we want to be your

608
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,320
first call as soon as you get a hint of

609
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
anything a couple reasons for that one

610
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,400
is you know we are kind of the experts

611
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,559
in terms of coordinating what vendors

612
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,080
are going to be good for this specific

613
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,240
situation it's not easy to get on our

614
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,960
panel like at coalition for example um

615
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
we've seriously vetted all of the

616
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,559
vendors involved okay so we get

617
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,000
something and we know okay this is the

618
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,919
breach coach that we want on it this is

619
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,960
the you know forensics team we want um

620
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,919
so

621
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,440
from like an expert

622
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,000
expertise point of view we know how to

623
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,520
coordinate it and

624
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,440
if coverage is a concern which you know

625
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,280
maybe some of the bigger the bigger

626
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,960
companies it's not as much and we're

627
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,480
just dealing with the incident but most

628
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,720
companies especially mid-size it

629
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,200
coverage is a concern and the later you

630
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,520
call your carrier the less likely

631
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
anything any of the decisions any of the

632
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,720
dollars you spent before they were

633
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
involved is going to be covered so it's

634
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,640
it's important um

635
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
to make sure that that your cyber

636
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,880
carrier is if not your first one of the

637
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,240
very first calls you make when an

638
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,799
incident comes across um but the first

639
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,960
thing i do is i send it over to you know

640
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
to breach coach to get them involved

641
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,159
right away so i think alex could kind of

642
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,559
piggyback on on that thought yeah i

643
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,720
would say to ryan's original point about

644
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
it it depends upon the size of the

645
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,840
company and whether or not they have an

646
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,360
incident response plan i would say you

647
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,600
know and that's absolutely true but then

648
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
when we think about ransomware context

649
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,360
and essentially three out of four

650
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,960
attacks are against companies with a

651
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,520
thousand or fewer employees i'd say that

652
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
i find that it's about 60 40 those

653
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,120
companies that don't have an incident

654
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,440
response plan um and then to to the

655
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,120
point about structuring that and the

656
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,799
order of calling

657
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,720
we absolutely write in there

658
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,400
one of the first two steps the first two

659
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,919
steps essentially need to be call your

660
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,440
insurer if you have cyber insurance and

661
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,640
then make sure you're calling your

662
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,919
outside counsel

663
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,880
um and as we get a matter in that those

664
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,400
are the questions that we ask too have

665
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,120
you already contacted your insurer um

666
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,760
and and so yeah i think that those are

667
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,280
steps that just

668
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,120
everyone's in such a panic mode whenever

669
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,200
ransomware attack comes in that's why

670
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,880
it's so important to have that plan to

671
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,559
outline those steps to kind of keep

672
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,720
everybody on track and the things that

673
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,240
you know when we talk to our clients

674
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,400
about incident response planning

675
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
you don't necessarily need to follow

676
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,559
every single step in order because facts

677
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,320
are different it's all factually

678
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,679
dependent and so you might go out of

679
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,600
order but those are really the

680
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,240
contacting of your insurance company and

681
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,159
your outside counsel are really the two

682
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,600
most critical steps that you have to

683
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,840
follow

684
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,280
definitely definitely

685
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,559
so there's a couple definitely

686
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,480
follow-ups there as well but i kind of

687
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,280
want to take a a step back i think chris

688
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
is probably for you at the group the

689
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,760
most qualified and and kind of look at

690
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,360
it from a technical perspective and then

691
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,200
come back and and talk with with

692
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,679
everyone else from more you know kind of

693
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,720
that external perspective as well but

694
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,840
for those

695
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,720
on the

696
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,640
call

697
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,240
you know can you give everybody at a

698
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,120
high level uh kind of walk through what

699
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,960
a general ir engagement for a ransomware

700
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,440
attack would look like

701
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,039
yeah so from a purely technical

702
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,640
perspective the very first thing that we

703
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
do when we're engaged with a ransomware

704
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,640
situation is we get on a scoping call

705
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,919
right and it typically has some

706
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,840
technical folks involved it also has

707
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,760
some leadership often we'll have counsel

708
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,960
on as well

709
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,720
and scoping call is just that we want to

710
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,000
understand your environment you want to

711
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,240
understand what's been impacted do we

712
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,159
have an edr in place kind of adam's

713
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,799
point earlier do you have mfa do we have

714
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,799
we tested our backups right do we know

715
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,720
that we could restore from them so the

716
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,840
scoping call is critical in helping us

717
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,440
understand who the players are and how

718
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,480
big the field is after that we typically

719
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,640
work through a containment strategy

720
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,559
right so that's typically how can we

721
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,240
lock down the environment how do we shut

722
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,900
off external

723
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,600
[Music]

724
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,679
ingress points into the network how do

725
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,960
we set up safe zones and and clear uh

726
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,440
vlans so that we can do triage devices

727
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,799
then we start talking about active

728
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,279
directory right most everyone has active

729
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,640
directory in their environment how we're

730
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,159
going to rebuild from that do we have

731
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,080
backups are we going to have to do from

732
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,000
replication so then it moves through

733
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,200
that

734
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,000
process right and that process can take

735
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,679
days or weeks depending on the size of

736
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,840
the company but the scoping is the very

737
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,640
first

738
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,000
time that we get engaged and we

739
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
understand who all the players are and

740
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
that's critically important to make sure

741
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,679
that we've got are we working at the

742
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,440
direction of council at that point right

743
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,520
and do we have insurance and good

744
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,760
because they dictate a lot of the the

745
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,919
ways that we move forward

746
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,200
after we get a true uh scoping of the

747
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,360
incident and and scoping is always the

748
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,720
most difficult because there's always

749
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,880
something that oh this vlan over here i

750
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,640
forgot about or no one knew was over

751
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,159
here and

752
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,760
that thing is still infected and we have

753
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,159
a clean network over here and they come

754
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,760
over and encrypt the entire environment

755
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,840
again so i've been on more than one call

756
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,679
saying now we have to start over because

757
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,600
we didn't realize that was there so

758
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,120
after we get into the containment that's

759
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,360
when we start moving into

760
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,200
the recovery right we want to eradicate

761
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,880
and recover from it

762
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,320
somewhere in between that is when you

763
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,919
start talking about negotiating the

764
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,080
ransoms right are we going to pay are we

765
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,600
not going to pay and that's what we

766
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,520
typically would bring in the negotiators

767
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,600
and again insurance and council can

768
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,960
advise on that

769
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,559
ultimately we want to get to recovery

770
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,400
right but recovery is not the final

771
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,080
stage recovery means we're going to

772
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,400
inform the next time so once we're back

773
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,600
up and running a lot of folks like to

774
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,520
say okay we're good now we can go back

775
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,760
and go grill out or whatever that's not

776
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,520
the end because you're just opening it

777
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,600
yourself up tab this happened again we

778
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,000
have to inform the irp or at least get

779
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,520
an irp for the next time so the the the

780
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,080
nist instance of incident response life

781
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,919
cycle there's five six steps in there

782
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,600
that's what we try to work through and

783
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,120
it's important to have a framework right

784
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,760
we have to have a common nomenclature so

785
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,080
that's a lot of information mike but it

786
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,600
really it gets really technical it can

787
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,440
go really deep inside of it but i will

788
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,400
tell you

789
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,720
having leadership on board having

790
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,880
counsel uh having insurance they can all

791
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,640
advise along the way and that really

792
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,320
helps the technical responders because

793
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,400
they're typically here on fire having

794
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,919
leadership above them pushing down and

795
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,600
giving them solid information is always

796
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,200
helpful

797
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,640
yeah definitely

798
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
you have to have that top-down support

799
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,080
otherwise it's you're just going to

800
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,000
flounder so i appreciate

801
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,039
that

802
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,120
especially

803
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,840
a few comments on that

804
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,320
so i think i think chris covered kind of

805
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,120
the ir aspects very well so there's also

806
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,240
i would say you know the the forensics

807
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,480
aspects where you know

808
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,039
from an investigation standpoint people

809
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,480
are going to want to image machines

810
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,760
potentially people are going to want to

811
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,880
identify

812
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,720
a root cause

813
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,320
you know in an investigation you're

814
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,919
going to kind of take that and that

815
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,360
investigation step like chris said from

816
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,279
a containment step you know could take

817
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,200
several weeks going through analysis you

818
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
may have to data mine information to see

819
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,399
what data was leaked

820
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,000
you know at some point near the end

821
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,039
you're going to come up with the

822
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,600
decision of do we write a report or not

823
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,240
and there's many considerations i think

824
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,919
that an organization needs to consider

825
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,240
do you have recommendations done do you

826
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,200
have

827
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,320
an actual report drafted and written

828
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,640
and some of the legal ramifications that

829
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,520
and council can advise on that um you

830
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,200
know there's been

831
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,320
a lot of changes recently that if you're

832
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,000
not aware of you probably should be

833
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,600
aware of alex can talk to those about

834
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,200
the eroding of privilege because a lot

835
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,120
of people kind of think you know

836
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,640
you know if we get counsel involved it's

837
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,120
all privileged well you know certain

838
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,960
pieces yes certain pieces no and it

839
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
really depends on kind of the engagement

840
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,200
so

841
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,520
yeah i can appreciate all of this too

842
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,440
and i have a follow-up couple follow-up

843
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,480
questions but

844
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,279
we might not get to them right now but i

845
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,880
do want to because we only have about 10

846
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,360
more minutes left so and that's probably

847
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,520
why i wanted to focus on you kind of the

848
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,159
technical overview so so thank you both

849
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,720
to chris and ryan um and then want to

850
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
circle back so

851
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,159
i think you know one of our first calls

852
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,600
is definitely to the the legal team so i

853
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,240
wanted to ask adam especially for since

854
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,120
most everybody here is much more of the

855
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,279
technical persuasion right what what do

856
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,840
us as

857
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,919
technical practitioners really need to

858
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,200
understand

859
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,960
about the the legal aspect to ransomware

860
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,440
i know you touch a little bit on it but

861
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,520
i might give you some more time to to be

862
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,600
able to dig a little bit deeper into it

863
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,320
and again what what do we really need to

864
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,200
know and how best to you know especially

865
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,960
work with our legal teams difference

866
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,760
between internal and external uh council

867
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,480
for

868
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,039
some of the larger organizations and

869
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,840
anything else you think we need to know

870
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,240
right and starting off the back um you

871
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,679
know alex and his team are going to be

872
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,919
able to provide more of the legal advice

873
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,799
you know

874
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,320
while i am an attorney it's important

875
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,080
i'm representing you know

876
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,720
as the coalition claims council i can't

877
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,840
really give specific legal advice to the

878
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,080
insureds right but

879
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,240
you know i mean ultimately it's figuring

880
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,960
out you know the forensics team is kind

881
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,520
of you know focused on the investigation

882
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,320
afterwards and it's our job really and

883
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,840
it will be alex and like baker

884
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,559
donaldson's job to determine okay we now

885
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,320
we know what data was accessed what

886
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,559
obligations does that trigger what

887
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,480
organizations whether government

888
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,720
organizations or individuals need to be

889
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,960
notified as a result of you know that

890
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,720
data being access a lot of people when

891
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,159
they're thinking of the ransomware it's

892
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,640
really their only focus is okay getting

893
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,240
back up and running

894
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,600
making sure we can get our business

895
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,279
restored and back on track and they're

896
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,200
not really thinking of like kind of that

897
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,760
second tier of okay we're back up and

898
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,240
running but whose pii was accessed

899
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,480
during this event right that's kind of

900
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,840
like the background thoughts okay now

901
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,000
that we're fully back and going

902
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,120
we need to figure out who we need to

903
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
notify because of of this ransomware

904
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,039
attack what was that threat actor

905
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,640
whether they were exfiltrate um you know

906
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,760
phi also as well is a huge factor but

907
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,399
you know that's kind of how we shift the

908
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,320
focus after you know after we get

909
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,159
everyone back online and alex can expand

910
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,200
on that

911
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,440
yeah i'll just from from our perspective

912
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,240
as breach council and outside counsel uh

913
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,000
one i'd say one of the first things that

914
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,320
we always say is that uh you need to

915
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,159
engage your vendors through us as

916
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,840
outside counsel ryan talked about some

917
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,919
of the holdings recently over the last

918
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,600
year and a half or so that have really

919
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,919
eroded the attorney client privilege

920
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,679
over forensic investigations and in

921
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,679
particular over forensic reports so it's

922
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,440
really really critical

923
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,440
that your outside counsel retains those

924
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,120
vendors on your behalf

925
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,039
number one and the number you know in

926
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,399
addition to that we wear a lot of

927
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,760
different hats we're working with the

928
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,640
forensic team to understand uh what

929
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,919
we're triaging the incident

930
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,200
understanding what has happened has

931
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,039
there been exfiltration of data are

932
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,279
systems encrypted do we are we going to

933
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,640
start negotiating potentially

934
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
negotiating with the threat actor for

935
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,000
the ransom demand

936
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,120
and thinking through those

937
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,679
considerations in addition to that are

938
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,039
we are we going to notify law

939
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,559
enforcement here whether that's through

940
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,720
an ic3 complaint online are we

941
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,159
contacting somebody with the secret

942
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,480
service how are we approaching this and

943
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,840
what information are we going to be

944
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,919
sharing with them at that time so we're

945
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,000
thinking through those um

946
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,320
you know and and then obviously i say as

947
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,320
the the forensic investigation starts to

948
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,760
wind down and we start to have some

949
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,840
conclusions that's when you know our job

950
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,159
really kicks in and we're thinking about

951
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,559
what notifications uh do we need to do

952
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,000
and that that really falls in three

953
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,600
different buckets from our perspective

954
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,240
one to regulators depending upon the

955
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,159
type of industry that the the company is

956
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,240
in you know there are some really short

957
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,360
deadlines

958
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,440
for you know financial companies or

959
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,799
things like that depending on who

960
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,080
they're regulated by where you need to

961
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,000
provide notice to them so we're thinking

962
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,960
through

963
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,399
uh to making sure that we're meeting

964
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,080
those deadlines two you may have

965
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,000
contractual obligations to your business

966
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,399
customers or somebody else where you

967
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,960
need to report uh an incident to them so

968
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,399
we're thinking about who do we need to

969
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,919
notify and then lastly the most

970
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,679
important one would be the individual

971
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,320
notifications and and that falls into

972
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,760
the conclusions and the forensic

973
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,919
investigation and things like that but

974
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,919
you know as we we think about all that

975
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,000
the big role that we've also played too

976
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,240
is in communications and and working

977
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,320
with either your internal comms team or

978
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
through crisis communications

979
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,760
and and thinking through all the

980
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,159
stakeholders that you may need to notify

981
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,080
here whether that's your employees your

982
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,720
customers uh your business customers

983
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,760
your

984
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,600
and and you know thinking through what

985
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,919
goes on paper and not just evaluating

986
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,679
the legal risk that comes with that but

987
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,720
then the reputational risk um and and

988
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,399
obviously we look at things from the

989
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,159
perspective of we if you're putting it

990
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,679
in writing and sending it out it's going

991
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,360
to be made public at some point whether

992
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,519
that's in litigation down the road or

993
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,279
through the media or something like that

994
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,840
and so we really work closely with with

995
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,559
those teams as well uh to on on the

996
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,640
messaging and crafting it to make sure

997
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,120
that we're both accurate and and

998
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,279
conveying a message that controls it for

999
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,200
the company to manage their reputation

1000
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,760
so um it's a lot of different hats and

1001
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,480
then i guess lastly i'll just add uh

1002
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,799
from the legal perspective

1003
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,480
in particular to paying a ransom i

1004
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,560
mentioned the the ofac guidance earlier

1005
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,480
and and making sure that we're we're

1006
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,079
having a ransom negotiator if we're

1007
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,879
using one do that compliance check to if

1008
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,639
we're making a payment obviously working

1009
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,239
with the insurance company as well to

1010
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,480
get their approval if that's needed

1011
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,320
uh to make that type that type of

1012
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,879
payment and then on the back end uh

1013
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,879
working with the mailing house and call

1014
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,239
centers and things like that if we're

1015
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,000
sending out notifications and helping

1016
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,320
with the scripting and obviously the

1017
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,760
notification letters to make sure that

1018
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,040
they're all compliant with the state

1019
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,480
laws

1020
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,480
no all great points

1021
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,560
i wanted to add quickly especially in

1022
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,800
light of the new ofac advisory you know

1023
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
last week um

1024
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,879
getting that ic3 filed and involving the

1025
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,599
fbi from the get-go is very important um

1026
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,599
it's something that i mean we're

1027
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,520
definitely emphasizing right now even

1028
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,119
reaching out to our personal fbi

1029
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,359
contacts it's it's crucial and i'm glad

1030
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,040
i brought that up because that's going

1031
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,280
to play a big role moving forward

1032
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,440
i think a lot of organizations still are

1033
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,160
at that point where oh i heard that

1034
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,640
i'm not allowed to pay a ransomware or

1035
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,720
am i allowed to pay a ransomware or you

1036
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,200
know ransom and i can sometimes and i

1037
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
can yeah there's a lot of confusion

1038
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,800
still and i think that's

1039
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,040
one that that still

1040
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,640
kind of will evolve

1041
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,680
continue to evolve over time

1042
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,599
and i appreciate alex talking about

1043
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,040
communication as well i think that's a

1044
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,079
strong focus i know no for us at floor

1045
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,760
you know controlling as you mentioned

1046
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,599
you controlling that narrative and

1047
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,839
whether it's you internally

1048
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,720
uh within our employees and then making

1049
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,280
sure of course the you know only those

1050
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,119
employees that need to know about an

1051
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,200
incident i mean thankfully ours are fear

1052
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,640
very few far

1053
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,599
far between but you know if if we had

1054
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,000
something more significant happen that

1055
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,680
you know we do control that narrative

1056
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,520
internally and then

1057
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,119
like you mentioned you know with with

1058
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,960
the reputational hit that can come and

1059
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
the risks that are there um you know

1060
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,040
we're very engaged as part of our

1061
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
incident response program with

1062
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,760
public relations and investor relations

1063
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,000
to to make sure we communicate

1064
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,240
you know that that information in that

1065
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,079
controlled manner to to the outside

1066
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,480
world so i appreciate those those

1067
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,839
thoughts as well

1068
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,440
uh so we only have a couple more minutes

1069
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,200
i thought we'd go around one more time

1070
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,119
and see you know what's one other thing

1071
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,119
that we didn't get to mention uh that

1072
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,079
you each feel that organizations need to

1073
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,079
be putting in place today

1074
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,000
to make sure that they're defending

1075
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,680
against ransomware or at least they're

1076
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,160
prepared in the event that that they

1077
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,119
become compromised so we'll go back to

1078
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,560
the top of the order so ryan you want to

1079
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,960
kick us off

1080
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,560
yeah you know i'm trying to think of

1081
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,800
something here and you know

1082
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,880
as cliche as it sounds and i think it's

1083
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,560
kind of been emphasized

1084
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,839
you know but think of it as a holistic

1085
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,079
program is really that

1086
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,960
idea concept model of defense and depth

1087
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,359
you know layered security

1088
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,400
perimeter endpoint identity

1089
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,000
whatever it is

1090
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,880
that your organization has from

1091
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,440
you know identification detection

1092
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
all the way to response you really need

1093
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,480
to you know have those conversations

1094
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,320
tabletop exercise it out as an

1095
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,920
organization

1096
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,400
and just be ready because

1097
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,960
you know it really

1098
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,079
is

1099
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,960
in my opinion it's not a matter of if

1100
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,119
it's going to be a matter of when

1101
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,280
definitely and i would say for those

1102
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
tabletops try to add a technical

1103
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
component as well where possible it's a

1104
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,480
more purple team rather than just blue

1105
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,400
team because sender you can have a lot

1106
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,880
of great table top conversations but if

1107
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,839
there's no hands-on component it seems

1108
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,560
to me at least that that a lot gets lost

1109
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,520
at least for you know technical um

1110
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,560
employees and team members

1111
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,079
yeah just one quick comment on the

1112
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,440
tabletop item

1113
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,040
sorry um

1114
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,400
if you're like oh we can't afford a

1115
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
tabletop or we can't come up with a

1116
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,760
script cesa just came out with

1117
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,240
i saw a link saw it on linkedin sisa

1118
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,160
just came out with a variety of

1119
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,240
different templates and scripts that

1120
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,880
they've written out for you to use

1121
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,680
for those tabletop exercises ransomware

1122
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,040
and others

1123
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,640
oh that's awesome and google i think

1124
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,720
sans has some out there uh for any

1125
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,320
gardener clients that are out there and

1126
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,640
they have has some great templates so

1127
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,320
yeah definitely check out for those

1128
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,920
resources but those are great so thanks

1129
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,640
for

1130
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,800
for mentioning that definitely all right

1131
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,560
chris any last thoughts

1132
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,720
yeah just really quickly it's hard to to

1133
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,119
to follow what ryan says right defensive

1134
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,960
depth is critical but i would tell you

1135
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,040
the biggest thing that i think we can do

1136
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,359
is equip our users so like security

1137
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,760
awareness training you know 40 of

1138
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,520
ransomware starts with a business email

1139
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,359
compromise right so the gray matter that

1140
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,440
sits for the monitor and the keyboard

1141
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,599
can be a huge threat or it could be a

1142
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,079
huge asset we have to make them an asset

1143
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,680
right we have to make them an ally and

1144
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,240
we have to make them our first line

1145
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,920
definitely those

1146
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,680
most incidents where i end up can be

1147
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,720
actually

1148
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,480
detected and reported by our users

1149
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,720
rather than all the maybe the hundreds

1150
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,400
of thousands or millions of dollars we

1151
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
spend on security controls and it just

1152
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,560
comes down to somebody having kind of

1153
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,200
that gut feeling that something's off

1154
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,960
absolutely appreciate that

1155
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,160
all right alex

1156
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,320
yeah i just to piggyback up off those

1157
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,160
two things i mean we all know that human

1158
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,760
error is really the biggest risk so that

1159
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,760
training piece is is critical but then

1160
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,359
the the training that you're going to do

1161
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,560
with your team through tabletop

1162
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,160
exercises and then the other thing i'll

1163
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,079
mention i talked about communications

1164
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,680
earlier

1165
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,400
understanding as you plan and

1166
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,480
defending against a potential attack

1167
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,240
understanding the different groups of

1168
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,079
stakeholders that your organization may

1169
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,400
need to communicate with because i feel

1170
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,200
like

1171
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,119
we get so focused on the individual side

1172
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,040
of things that that we lose track of all

1173
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,359
the different groups that we may need to

1174
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,839
uh communicate with in responding to an

1175
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,560
incident or or a potential threat

1176
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,839
great point i

1177
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,440
i just even think of it as a client

1178
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,440
perspective and then what how should i

1179
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,280
interact with my clients i remember when

1180
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,599
the rsa breach happened and we had our

1181
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,520
you know sales rep contacting us and

1182
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,920
letting us know what happened or or even

1183
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,839
with you know fire iron mania with solar

1184
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,680
wednesday i remember when they contacted

1185
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,440
us to let us know hey we've been

1186
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,480
breached before they realized how big it

1187
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,839
actually was

1188
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,839
so i appreciate those thoughts and then

1189
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,720
adam

1190
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,079
and quickly

1191
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,560
from an insurance perspective um you

1192
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,160
know the market is clearly hardening as

1193
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,000
the carriers try to figure out you know

1194
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,599
how how do we

1195
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,599
you know evaluate this risk i mean

1196
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,359
you're seeing a lot of co-insurance and

1197
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,839
sub limits and all that um and it's

1198
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,680
basically figure out how you can become

1199
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,240
the best insured it's not a complex um

1200
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,560
you know formula echoing what these guys

1201
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,319
have all said having that you know

1202
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,720
robust response plan ready to go closing

1203
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,040
up vulnerabilities viable backups

1204
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,720
closing rdp

1205
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,560
um and making sure you know the first

1206
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,480
thing i was mentioned it's so easy make

1207
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,400
sure across the board you have that mfa

1208
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,200
so

1209
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,880
it's it's things like that just kind of

1210
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,440
the idea of having a regular

1211
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,200
you know making sure your organization

1212
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,800
