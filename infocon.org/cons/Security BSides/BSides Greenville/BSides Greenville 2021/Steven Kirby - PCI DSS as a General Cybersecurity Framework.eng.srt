1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,359
excellent

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,840
i'm technologically challenged i'm one

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,440
of the old guys that always had 12

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,519
o'clock blinking on the vcr back in the

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,920
day so

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,840
uh it how i wound up in technology is

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,039
another question altogether

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,400
i'd like to thank you all for stopping

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,359
by my talk this morning uh my name is

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,519
stephen kirby i'm a

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,880
systems slash security engineer for

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,640
rns solutions

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,840
a small uh

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,559
logistics company out of

15
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,719
jackson tennessee and we're going to be

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,640
talking a little bit about how we're

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
using the pci dss

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,000
security framework as a general purpose

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,239
framework uh

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,600
for controlling our security environment

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,680
give you a little bit about me i'm a 30

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,920
year it vet started in the late 1980s

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,559
and for me uh besides greenville is a

24
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,559
little bit of a homecoming

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,439
i spent about 12 years in athens georgia

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,760
at the university of georgia and for all

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,520
the clemson fans better luck next year

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,320
i grabbed i gravitated to security early

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
on uh

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,640
started out with nobel netwear and moved

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
into dozens of play a dozen or so

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,560
flavors of unix

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,600
and i even do windows now uh generally

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,920
under an assumed name

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,759
i do hold multiple security

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,280
certifications

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,880
and that's always important because you

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,079
know

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,600
if you're not certified you don't know

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,759
anything right

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,360
and as i mentioned i am currently a

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,079
systems engineer for rns solutions out

43
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,279
of jackson tennessee

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,119
a few caveats are in order before we get

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,439
to too far gone into this

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,920
number one i make no claim to be a pci

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,159
dss expert

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,960
uh

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,360
my current employer are not is not

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,399
subject to pci compliance requirements

51
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,880
and so we don't do this in air quotes

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,479
for real

53
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,399
uh

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,720
don't assume that anything i say matches

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,280
the pci's interpretation of their

56
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,400
standard

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,160
they know better than i do

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,480
and if you're doing this

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,440
to

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,319
in order to process payment cards don't

61
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,480
let me lead you astray we could be a

62
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,440
little bit more flexible than the pci is

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,959
going to be when when it comes time to

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,120
do an audit

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,040
i would also stress that the opinions

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,280
expressed here are my own

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
and they're not those of any employer

68
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,560
past or present

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,879
okay

70
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,120
a high level uh discussion of what we're

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,319
going to do what we're going to talk

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,959
about in the next few minutes we include

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,360
four major points number one

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,120
just so we start from a common ground

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,200
we're going to talk about what is a

76
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,519
security framework

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,800
we'll talk about some of the most

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,720
popular frameworks

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,640
and see if i can answer a question why

80
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
would i want to use yet another one

81
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,239
aren't there enough other good ones out

82
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,680
there

83
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,599
i'll talk some about how we chose to

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,000
adapt pci dss

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
at rns solutions

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,200
and we'll bring about some key takeaways

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,480
uh

88
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,120
i will emphasize that my perspective

89
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,720
at rns is that of a very small business

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,879
i can tell you that as of last week we

91
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,879
had 104

92
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,920
uh office 365 licenses

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,000
and a good number of those were going to

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,159
contractors and to

95
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,120
uh third-party vendors that were using

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,040
them for for purposes other than their

97
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,319
primary email we are a small shop and

98
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,000
that definitely has an impact on

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
anything that i talked about

100
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,000
if you have to put it in perspective our

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,920
security team consists

102
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,640
primarily of me myself and i and not

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,120
even all of that i have responsibility

104
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,640
for uh managing linux and windows

105
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,480
systems and

106
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,560
uh general networking issues and

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,640
anything else that crops up

108
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,360
we have two other engineers on one other

109
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,599
engineering and our manager

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,160
on on the technical end the other

111
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,918
engineer has no

112
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,639
no formal responsibility for security at

113
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,358
all

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,639
and my manager is uh spread thin as it

115
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,400
is he has a good security mind and i'm

116
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,040
very fortunate uh to have him that's one

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
of the reasons why i'm there

118
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,040
but

119
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,000
we're

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
we don't have a probably a single fte

121
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,600
devoted to security full time

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
if you have a large organization some of

123
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,919
these things may not be

124
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,639
as beneficial but for us a lot of things

125
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,080
i'm going to talk about today were

126
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,240
critical because the alternative really

127
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,479
was having no formal security program at

128
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,440
all okay an introduction to security

129
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,919
frameworks what is a security framework

130
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,880
well

131
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,800
a security framework is a high level

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,039
strategy for protect protecting

133
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,520
information assets

134
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,600
it provides guidelines and best

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,479
practices frameworks provide guidance on

136
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,639
what to do but they don't tell you how

137
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,000
to do it

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
typically a framework will say

139
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,080
use strong encryption

140
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,000
they will not say

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,160
use a aes-256

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,240
there will probably be probably be some

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,400
understanding that you would use an

144
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,199
industry standard and ae256 definitely

145
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,560
would qualify

146
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
des probably does not

147
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,680
but that's not going to be specified in

148
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,080
the framework it will be specified in

149
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,919
some of the supporting documentation

150
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,919
uh there's several examples of popular

151
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,080
general security frameworks i'm going to

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,960
mention three iso 27001 or actually the

153
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,960
entire iso 27000 series

154
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,840
uh the nist cyber security framework or

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
the csf

156
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,719
and the cis critical security controls

157
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,000
the first one that i'll mention is iso

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,560
27001 or as i mentioned the 27 000

159
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,000
series

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,080
and

161
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
it's part of an international set of

162
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
standards it was originally developed as

163
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,840
a british standard

164
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,199
back i believe in the 1990s i'd have to

165
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,880
have to go back and check on the date

166
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,600
but

167
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,560
uh

168
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,360
it's grown in popularity particularly in

169
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,680
europe in the last 15 20 years

170
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,840
one of the difficulties or

171
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,479
obstacles that you face with iso is that

172
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,560
the official standards documents have to

173
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,720
be purchased and they're not cheap

174
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,800
uh there are a number of them and they

175
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,759
are

176
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
for our but given our budget they were

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,160
prohibitively expensive

178
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,599
the good thing one of the good things

179
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,280
about 27 the 27 000 series it is very

180
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,759
structured and very formal

181
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,479
so

182
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,479
if you are a large organization with the

183
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,840
resources resources to throw at it

184
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,360
uh

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,880
it allows you

186
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,800
to develop a very thorough framework

187
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,080
the iso uh 27000 series assumes an

188
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,120
information

189
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
security management system is already in

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,160
place so it's not really

191
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
there are some uh startup costs

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,800
associated with trying to implement this

193
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,800
standard

194
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,199
the main benefit from iso 27001

195
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,560
and other other associated uh frameworks

196
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,319
is getting certified by an approved

197
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,759
third party

198
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,639
and that costs money lots of it it's a

199
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,360
it's an expensive process to go through

200
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,199
and as i mentioned with our small staff

201
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,039
and small budget it never really was a

202
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,440
serious contender

203
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,879
the other thing worth noting is that

204
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,639
it's not as popular in the united states

205
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,160
as elsewhere

206
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
as i mentioned on the slide

207
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,879
see also soccer and formula one

208
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,919
uh this is very popular internationally

209
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,639
not so much here in the us

210
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,120
here in the us probably

211
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,680
the big dog would be the nist cyber

212
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,720
security framework or csf

213
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,160
it's also very detailed uh

214
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,520
special publication

215
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,840
800-171 r2 is the short form of the

216
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,479
standard designed for non-governmental

217
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,399
agencies the original

218
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,360
framework was designed for

219
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,880
federal government agencies and

220
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,839
contractors and for them compliance is

221
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,360
mandatory

222
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,000
uh the short form there i mentioned is

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,959
113 pages with extensive links to

224
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,120
external documents so it's quite

225
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,680
detailed most recently revised in

226
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,480
february of this year one of the

227
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
problems that we ran into

228
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
looking at it

229
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,279
is that it doesn't way to prioritize

230
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,000
individual controls quite the same way

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
that

232
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,839
pci dss does and we'll see what i mean

233
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,760
by that in a moment

234
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,200
it allows quite a bit of room for

235
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,959
interpretation and it has to because

236
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,080
it's

237
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,360
it's intended to be a one-size-fits-all

238
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
type of framework

239
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
and it can be a little i can tell you

240
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,399
from having looked at it

241
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,080
that if you're a small shop it could be

242
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,320
a little bit daunting if dedicated

243
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,399
resources are small or non-existent

244
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,760
one of the other popular security

245
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,399
frameworks here in the us would be the

246
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,760
cis

247
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,040
uh

248
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
top top controls they're now called just

249
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,440
the top controls because the number has

250
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,640
changed

251
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,600
uh it got it began life as the sands top

252
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,959
20 and then became known as the cis cis

253
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,880
top 20 it's now the cis top 18 controls

254
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,399
because the ver in version 8 of the of

255
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,399
the framework released in may of this

256
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,640
year the number was reduced i think they

257
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,680
combined some of the elements

258
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,079
one of the one of the benefits of the

259
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,640
the top controls framework is that it

260
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,040
does help prioritize individual controls

261
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,880
for example if you're a small

262
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
organization there's an implementation

263
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,200
they've impl they've introduced the idea

264
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,519
of implementation groups

265
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,120
and there are three three levels of

266
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,839
those implementation group one is aimed

267
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,600
at small organizations

268
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,079
uh implementation group three would

269
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,200
probably be applicable to a fortune 5 or

270
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,959
something like that

271
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,360
it's easy to overlook the cis

272
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
controls because 18 to 20 controls

273
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,480
doesn't sound like much the reality is

274
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,399
it's much more detailed than it sounds

275
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,079
there are a whole lot of subsections

276
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,279
under each individual control

277
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,079
and if

278
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,760
if we had uh not gone with pci dss this

279
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,720
probably would have been the

280
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,519
framework that i tried to implement

281
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,560
the problem with cis is that it doesn't

282
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,800
have the kind of supporting tools that

283
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,399
we're going to look at here in a minute

284
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,399
that pci makes available for

285
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,839
folks who are trying to implement their

286
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,320
framework in order to comply with

287
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,240
payment card processing requirements

288
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,079
the way to get started is to quit

289
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,800
talking and begin doing and the reason

290
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,160
that

291
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,640
i would give for why we decided to go

292
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,640
with pci dss as a general

293
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,120
non-binding framework is that it made it

294
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,040
easier for us to get the program off the

295
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,120
ground up and running

296
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,560
um

297
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,760
we started in may of this year really

298
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,639
and we are already in the process of

299
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,440
completing our first self-assessment

300
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,839
uh i'm not sure i could have pulled that

301
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,920
off if i tried to go through

302
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,519
and implement some of the other more

303
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,959
detailed standards

304
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
pci dss or the payment card industry

305
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,240
data security standard is a another

306
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,639
security control and compliance is

307
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,959
mandatory for organizations that process

308
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,720
payment cards credit and debit card

309
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,320
transactions

310
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,399
it's not intended for use as a general

311
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,639
purpose security framework

312
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,560
but it can be adapted for that use very

313
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,399
easily in fact

314
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,120
if if you want if you want to know the

315
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,680
presentation in a nutshell download some

316
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,399
of the pci tools do a global finder

317
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,639
replace find card holder data replaced

318
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,800
with sensitive data and you're done

319
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,320
then all you got to do is all you have

320
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,399
to do is go implement it

321
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,920
the idea of doing that was presented in

322
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,680
a cissp training course i took oh

323
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,480
a year or so ago taught by kevin henry

324
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,720
who

325
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,200
uh basically taught developed the

326
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,079
training materials for isc squared for

327
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,440
for

328
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,519
the cissp

329
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,120
i thought it sounded like an interesting

330
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,639
idea so i that was the first thought

331
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,399
that popped into my head

332
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,240
when i was trying to find a framework

333
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,800
that we could uh that would work for us

334
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,600
in a small company

335
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,480
pci does produce a spreadsheet that

336
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
we'll see in a moment called the prior

337
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,880
prioritized approach tool and i found

338
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,279
that to be very useful

339
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,320
it helps decide which which uh controls

340
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,959
need to be implemented first it actually

341
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,639
it's color coded

342
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,360
with here so you can look at at a glance

343
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,279
and say okay i need to do this group

344
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,079
first this group second and this group

345
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,920
six down here we'll put off to the very

346
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,360
end

347
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
it makes it easy to track and document

348
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,040
implementation

349
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,959
as you proceed through the spreadsheet

350
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,959
and through review the controls there

351
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,360
are sections to indicate yes we did this

352
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,560
no we didn't here's what we have to do

353
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,360
excuse me here's what

354
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,800
here's our plan going forward

355
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
and i think that that is a key advantage

356
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,920
of other uh of pci dss

357
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,720
over other uh for security frameworks

358
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,600
for example cis top 20. you could

359
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,560
develop the same sort of documentation

360
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,800
for

361
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,959
any of the controls that i mentioned

362
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,079
earlier

363
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,000
but you would have to go out and do that

364
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,560
for yourself with pci you can download

365
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,399
it from their document library

366
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,800
make a few pro a few appropriate

367
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,120
customizations and have a full suite of

368
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,680
documentation ready to begin in a matter

369
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,239
of days

370
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,680
a few of the things that i like about

371
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,240
the pci dss are that the controls are

372
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,560
focused and detailed they provide

373
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,120
structure but not constraints again they

374
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,240
don't specify that you have to to use a

375
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
particular level of encryption let's say

376
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
but they do specify that it needs to be

377
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,760
an industry standard and i would want to

378
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
document what that standard i'm

379
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,079
following is

380
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,440
in the spreadsheet as i work through it

381
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,880
the controls are adaptable for

382
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,639
organizations with small acting staffs

383
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,360
because at the end of the day

384
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,399
pci is targeted at everybody who

385
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,199
processes credit cards or debit cards

386
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,359
so

387
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,279
they will have to i mean they have to us

388
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,959
be adaptable

389
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,000
to organization mom and pop grocery and

390
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,839
drug stores for example

391
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,600
uh they won't those folks won't

392
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,519
necessarily have to provide the same

393
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,399
level of documentation that a larger

394
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,639
organization would say a

395
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,720
credit card clearing house but they have

396
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,639
to be able to provide some information

397
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,040
or find someone who can provide it for

398
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,880
them

399
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,720
the concepts are easy to explain to

400
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,839
non-technical personnel

401
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,920
one of the easiest sales jobs i've ever

402
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,240
done was ex having to explain to our

403
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,519
leadership

404
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,440
that our goal is to process our

405
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,199
sensitive information with the same

406
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,560
level of care

407
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,120
that we would process if you were

408
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
dealing with credit card transactions

409
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,959
that intuitively made sense to them

410
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,720
because

411
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,240
because so many organizations are

412
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,720
familiar with pci dss

413
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,480
it's easy to communicate what we're

414
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,199
doing to other organizations that ask

415
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,519
about our security policies

416
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,480
and the as i mentioned the biggest uh

417
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,320
advantage that we have found

418
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,079
is that extensive documentation is

419
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,160
available directly from pcids dss at no

420
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,199
charge

421
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,639
uh and that's certainly a welcome uh

422
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,480
benefit for an organization with tight

423
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,440
security budget

424
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,959
this is an example of the

425
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,880
prioritized approach spreadsheet and you

426
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,320
can see there

427
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
a whole list

428
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,839
of subordinate requirements under the

429
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,759
major requirement

430
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,199
install and maintain a firewall

431
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,640
configuration and you have prioritized

432
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,839
lists one through six level one being

433
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,559
stop what you're doing and do this first

434
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,319
two is what you do after that and then

435
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,439
there are an additional six levels of

436
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,199
uh

437
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,640
priority

438
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,119
you can indicate it are you done yes or

439
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,679
no if you're not explain why

440
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,880
and then provide a little bit of

441
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,559
explanation out

442
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,359
uh

443
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,200
in the additional columns

444
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,440
and you have documented the stat the

445
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,480
current status of your security program

446
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,720
in a very detailed fashion once you've

447
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
finished

448
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,039
the uh

449
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,679
process in the spreadsheet

450
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,039
pci uses a

451
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,440
three-pronged approach basically the

452
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
first stage is to assess and identify

453
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,799
all locations where sensitive data might

454
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,160
be stored taking an inventory of assets

455
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
and analyzing those for vulnerabilities

456
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,640
that could expose sensitive data

457
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,880
the next step is to repair find the

458
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
vulnerabilities and fix them

459
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,880
and then

460
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,120
the third third stage would be to report

461
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,440
a document report document your

462
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,000
assessment and your remediation details

463
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,080
and at that point you're ready to to

464
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,400
begin the process again so this is a

465
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,559
continual cycle assess repair report

466
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,120
and we are now at the report stage for

467
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,120
our our first pass through

468
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,039
there's some things that are useful to

469
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,400
keep in mind

470
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,240
when you're uh trying to apply pci dss

471
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
one the most important is that unless

472
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,400
you're processing payment card data

473
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
there's no need to stick to the absolute

474
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,760
letter pci dss

475
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,080
uh you're not going to get penalized if

476
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,919
you don't you will be you probably will

477
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,760
be less secure

478
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,160
but so long as you can say you're

479
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,240
keeping in the spirit

480
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,400
that probably is going to be good enough

481
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,760
for example

482
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,679
uh there's no you need to use third

483
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,000
party a third party for external

484
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,799
vulnerability scans penetration tests or

485
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,160
audits

486
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,080
uh you can take that you can do that

487
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,360
in-house so long as you're not trying to

488
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,280
process payment cards and we have done

489
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,679
so we we do conduct

490
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,400
external vulnerability scans against all

491
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,000
of our environments

492
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
uh using a third-party vendor that we

493
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,320
contracted with for a very small

494
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,000
charge i was quite pleased with that

495
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,679
if we were doing this for real we'd have

496
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,919
to use an approved scanning vendor and

497
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,960
the cost would have gone up

498
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,679
substantially

499
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,600
informal self-assessment can take the

500
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,360
place of an audit and we'll talk about

501
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,520
that a little bit in just a moment

502
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,240
and the pci dss does offer guidance for

503
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,600
performing such an assessment

504
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,960
uh

505
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,120
pci dss requires payment card

506
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,280
information to be deleted

507
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,080
as soon as there's no longer a business

508
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,919
need to retain it

509
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,919
that's good practice and i definitely

510
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,760
would do that but there are some things

511
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
that our management wants to keep around

512
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,679
longer than i wish they would

513
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,760
we're not we're not failing to be in

514
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,159
compliance because of that so it does

515
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,919
give you flexibility whether or not that

516
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,720
flexibility is a good thing uh

517
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,440
is subject to debate

518
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,960
there's no deadline to achieve

519
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,559
compliance we do not have a sword

520
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,880
hanging over our head that if we don't

521
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,520
get our assessment done by

522
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,280
31 december

523
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,200
that we're going to no longer be able to

524
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,440
process payment cards because we're not

525
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,159
doing that this is just us

526
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,039
using this framework to go as a as a

527
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,200
form of guidance and there's no no

528
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,000
penalty for falling out of compliance if

529
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,559
uh you if you're your next cycle you

530
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,320
detect that something is no longer

531
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,919
working

532
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,600
it's not the end of the world you need

533
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,840
to fix it but it doesn't put your

534
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,159
ability to do business at any risk

535
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,320
it may be something you need to address

536
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,640
as soon as possible maybe today or

537
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,679
tomorrow

538
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,840
but you're not at a risk of being having

539
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,280
your ability to do business suspended

540
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,760
there's some sections of pci dss that

541
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,919
may not apply for example we don't

542
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,840
develop applications in-house and there

543
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,960
are entire

544
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,440
chunks of some of the security controls

545
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,840
that don't apply to us those were those

546
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
were my favorite sections i sailed

547
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,520
through those

548
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
uh some sections are aimed service

549
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,840
providers and those are outside entities

550
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,200
that could impact

551
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,760
impact security of cardholder data you

552
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,600
won't need to necessarily worry about

553
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,600
those

554
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,919
important points to keep in mind would

555
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,000
be that provisions are not restricted to

556
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,120
information that is stored

557
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,880
electronically

558
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
as difficult as it is for us and what is

559
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,600
now almost a digital age to remember

560
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,360
there's still a lot of paper records out

561
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,520
there and those paper records need to be

562
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,320
secured or securely disposed up too

563
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,399
pci does take that into account

564
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,440
pci envisions the secure environment to

565
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,000
be a subset of the company network but

566
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,559
when you're processing sensitive data as

567
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,679
opposed to

568
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,240
payment card data it may not be it may

569
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,200
not be possible to simply isolate

570
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,600
off into one segment of the network your

571
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
accounting department may need to be

572
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,520
able to talk to hr which may need to be

573
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,480
able to talk to the ceo ceo's office and

574
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,640
the cfo so you may wind up with a larger

575
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,880
shared environment and that means that

576
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,080
you're going to need to look at some of

577
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,760
the controls that we would normally

578
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,880
apply

579
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,400
to a

580
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,120
segmented environment and apply them

581
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,760
possibly to a larger segment of your

582
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,120
larger spread of your network

583
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,640
there are a few common pitfalls that

584
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
i've discovered in reading and in our

585
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,240
own experience

586
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,039
for organizations that are attempting to

587
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,880
comply

588
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,799
even either to the letter or into the

589
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,559
spirit with pci dss

590
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,240
the bugaboo for every security

591
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,360
professional i've ever known has been

592
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,520
failing to change default passwords on

593
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,480
network devices routers switches iot

594
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,440
uh

595
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,880
printers

596
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,039
uh printers

597
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,360
uh multi-function printers are very

598
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,200
useful as penetration testing tools

599
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,159
because

600
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,520
most of the most of the default

601
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,799
passwords you can find through a

602
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,880
google or a search engine

603
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,799
uh and very few

604
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,039
it seems to be common practice amongst

605
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,200
uh printer service technicians

606
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,200
to keep those set to the same thing for

607
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,600
convenience sake and there are seven

608
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,039
have been several um

609
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,360
conference presentations on how to use

610
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,279
set up a reverse shell on the printer

611
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,039
and use them to capture

612
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,880
uh

613
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,679
credentials as people come come to

614
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,360
log into the printer to print something

615
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
poorly written web apps that allow sql

616
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
injections and sql injections is hard to

617
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,520
believe are still an issue

618
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,880
but they still make the a wasp

619
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,360
top 10 on a regular basis

620
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,080
sql injections or exposing a database to

621
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,480
the public internet

622
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,720
directly i mean it's hard to believe

623
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,880
that those are still problems but they

624
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,720
are

625
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,960
uh and then another big issue would be

626
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,760
exposing sensitive data to insecure

627
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,240
networks or endpoints the the most

628
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,559
obvious example would be

629
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,720
byod devices

630
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,919
that are excuse me

631
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
allowed to connect directly to the

632
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,039
company network

633
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,799
or

634
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,640
are somehow able to gain access to the

635
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,120
company network through guest wireless

636
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,799
because that wireless network isn't

637
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,360
properly segmented

638
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,200
i show my age here

639
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,679
sack it to me reminds me of the late

640
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,200
1960s uh comedy show rowan and martin's

641
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,919
laughing one of the by phrases or

642
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,200
catchphrases

643
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,080
on that show with socket to me so

644
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,919
if you remember laugh in you know where

645
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,640
this came from and if not well i'm old

646
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,720
organizations that prom that process

647
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,400
payment cards are required to submit

648
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,200
responses to an annual self-assessment

649
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,640
questionnaire

650
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,559
and the saq

651
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,400
for self-requesting self-assessment

652
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,679
questionnaire

653
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,520
is a standardized form that can be

654
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,000
downloaded from the pci dss document

655
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,600
library

656
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,960
we're working with with the

657
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,600
questionnaire for class d merchants

658
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,080
and we found it very very useful

659
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,720
the one problem that i did run into was

660
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,520
that

661
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,480
the form as it is delivered by pci

662
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,279
is a pdf file so i spent the better part

663
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,000
of about three days converting that into

664
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,400
a spreadsheet similar to the

665
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,120
uh one that we looked at earlier once i

666
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,039
got there it great that greatly

667
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,440
simplified the process of doing our

668
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,520
self-assessment which we recently just

669
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,000
completed

670
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,559
uh with modifications that

671
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,320
self-assessment questionnaire provides a

672
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,480
great template for an annual review of

673
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,960
an organization security practices i'm

674
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,640
using it to prepare an end of the year

675
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,120
report uh for our ownership and

676
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,559
management which is something that

677
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,600
they've never had before

678
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,440
one thing i will say is that you should

679
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,679
not fail fear failing your first

680
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,679
assessment

681
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,440
particularly if you're starting from

682
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,960
ground zero

683
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,840
uh in a small shop that has not had an

684
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,080
active security program before you're

685
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,520
not going to get everything done in the

686
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,240
first year what you can do is map out a

687
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,960
road map for what needs to be done

688
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,679
and maybe come up with a an improvement

689
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,720
plan

690
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,279
to get the top priorities taken care of

691
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,120
in the next

692
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,360
six to eight months

693
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,760
uh since we're not using pci for

694
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,919
compliance purposes our objective is a

695
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,679
little bit different than

696
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,640
uh

697
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,039
the standard we simply need to identify

698
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,720
what we need to do

699
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,799
what we're actually doing both what

700
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,480
we're doing well and what we're not

701
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,919
doing well

702
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,440
and we're going to we're done we need to

703
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,720
identify

704
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,960
what we're not doing but need to do in

705
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,159
future

706
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,760
and then develop a strategy to close

707
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,480
those gaps

708
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,440
the final section of the saq document is

709
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,159
at

710
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,360
a station

711
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,360
of compliance or aoc the other aoc

712
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,520
aoc doesn't assume or require full

713
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,000
compliance even for

714
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
environments that are in scope for pci

715
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,679
dss

716
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,399
what it does necessarily

717
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,000
it provides an ac what it does is

718
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,720
provide an action plan for non-compliant

719
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,080
requirements and a timetable for re for

720
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
completing those requirements and it can

721
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,000
be massaged to generate a summary of

722
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,720
your current cert security practices

723
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,240
that you can share with your with

724
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
customers and potential customers in

725
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,159
fact that's exactly what we intend to do

726
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
some key takeaways

727
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,799
from this

728
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,240
uh things that you're going to need to

729
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,520
look at

730
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,200
especially carefully

731
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,880
if you do decide to follow pci dss

732
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,520
one is network protection

733
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,720
you're going to need make sure you've

734
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,440
got

735
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,840
firewalls in all the right places and

736
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,480
that your network is properly segmented

737
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,919
uh as has been mentioned elsewhere in

738
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,960
other talks this morning

739
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,679
there's no such thing as a

740
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,279
there's no such thing as a security

741
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,559
professional who doesn't believe in

742
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,120
network segmentation

743
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,960
you'll need to be careful with passwords

744
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,440
and default settings make sure that

745
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,960
none of your devices are using the

746
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,240
default passwords the users are

747
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,559
choosing secure passwords because we're

748
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,840
stuck with them for the time being

749
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,640
that i would emphasize making sure that

750
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,080
none of your passwords have been

751
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,840
involved in a data breach because the

752
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,960
definition

753
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
of what constitutes a good

754
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,120
a secure password has changed

755
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,840
considerably in the last uh five or ten

756
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,279
years

757
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,200
and make sure that all the default

758
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,520
settings are all the settings on your

759
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,720
network devices and pcs are configured

760
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
correctly

761
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,399
uh you'll need to make sure that

762
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,200
data at rest is properly encrypted

763
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,120
the data in

764
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,080
in transit is properly encrypted

765
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,159
that you have malware protection and is

766
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,000
kept updated

767
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,520
that systems are hardened if they're

768
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,919
patched and the unnecessary services

769
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,840
have been removed

770
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,600
make sure that each user has their own

771
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,159
account and that a password is assigned

772
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,240
to the account and that you can track

773
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,399
exactly who has done what in as much as

774
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,840
possible

775
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,679
you need to restrict physical access to

776
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,320
sensitive data make sure that

777
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,279
your

778
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,200
your cert your main server shouldn't be

779
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,840
on a pc sitting under somebody's desk

780
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,279
it's been a while but i have seen that

781
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,120
you need to restrict physical access to

782
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,799
sensitive data

783
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,720
for example backup tapes if anyone's

784
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,200
still backing up to tape

785
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,960
that's almost as good as having access

786
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,799
to the data itself it needs to be

787
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,640
secured it needs to be encrypted and it

788
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,440
needs to be stored securely

789
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,760
you'll need to have logging and log

790
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,760
management set up some form of central

791
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,240
log management or storage for example a

792
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,679
seam

793
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,679
you'll need vulnerability management

794
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,640
practice both internally and externally

795
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,480
you'll need to conduct regular risk

796
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,960
assessment and documentation which turns

797
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,279
out to be easier said than done we're

798
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,480
still wrestling with that ourselves

799
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,080
and you'll need to perform regular

800
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,480
reviews at least annually and following

801
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,039
every any major change to your

802
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,039
infrastructure

803
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,200
summary

804
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,360
security frameworks are a useful roadmap

805
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,000
for developing a security program

806
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,880
uh dependent upon available resources

807
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,200
some more established uh frameworks may

808
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,480
not be viable for smaller organizations

809
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,320
my advice would be to find a framework

810
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,440
that you like and stick with it

811
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,080
the pci dss was developed to secure

812
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,000
payment card data but it can be

813
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,760
leveraged to create a viable security

814
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,679
framework for both small and

815
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,440
medium-sized organizations

816
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,679
i thank you very much for coming by my

817
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,200
talk i think we're done a little bit

818
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,480
early

819
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
if we have questions i'll be glad to

820
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,320
take them and i will provide a link to

821
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,080
the slide deck in the chat in case

822
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,000
anybody wants it

823
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
thank you

824
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,480
and let's see

825
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,679
great stephen

826
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,000
and i know my experience with this is um

827
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,320
this is mark um i work for a company

828
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,880
that had nine um

829
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,279
nine other companies that i oversaw and

830
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,600
two of them had the pci compliant

831
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
compliance requirement

832
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,279
and they had they had a contract in

833
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,600
place to do the external scanning

834
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,399
and i thought it was fabulous and so i

835
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,000
you know got with the same company and

836
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,159
put a contract in place to scan the

837
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,000
other seven country companies

838
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,760
now it was a totally separate agreement

839
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,120
so it wouldn't you know mess up their

840
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,760
results but it was just so nice to be

841
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,399
able to get the same type of information

842
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,360
easily it was so easy for me to do that

843
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,240
yes

844
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,080
that that's wonderful we actually went

845
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,600
out and

846
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,000
evaluated some companies that

847
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,679
uh

848
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,679
provide this as a service not

849
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,679
necessarily for pci

850
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,080
and found one that allows us to do uh

851
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,320
they're actually selling open vaz

852
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,080
uh which

853
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,600
again probably

854
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,200
wouldn't have been my first choice but

855
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,880
the price was right

856
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,720
and it does allow us to at least

857
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,080
guarantee that

858
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,600
for example i can promise you that we're

859
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
not that we don't have rdp running on

860
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,320
any of our public ids that was my first

861
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
big concern when i got there

862
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,679
uh and those are the things that you

863
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,840
need to check for it it helps to make

864
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,919
sure that you have things buttoned up as

865
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,519
well as you do because i think if you

866
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,799
ask

867
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,720
any systems administrator anywhere in

868
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,880
the world all of them would deny that

869
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
they have uh

870
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,039
rdp port 389

871
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,679
3389 exposed to the internet

872
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,559
and we know obviously that has not been

873
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,720
the case

874
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,399
and another issue that you encounter is

875
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,320
when you tell somebody they need to do

876
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,840
something

877
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,880
they're like well that's just your

878
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,799
opinion yeah we've been doing it this

879
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,640
other way forever

880
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,480
and when you have some type of standard

881
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,880
to stand behind you and go well no

882
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,640
this is the best practice according to

883
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,559
this industry standard this is why you

884
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,399
need to do it you tend to get more

885
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,880
traction if it's an industry standard

886
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,279
you're trying to implement versus what

887
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,360
could be considered your opinion

888
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,120
yeah and that's one of the reasons that

889
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,080
we

890
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,159
adopted a framework

891
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,919
developed in our program because it was

892
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,000
easier to sell to management they

893
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
intuitively understood when we said

894
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,839
we're pro we're handling all of our

895
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,760
sensitive data the way we would handle

896
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,800
credit card data it made sense to them i

897
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
don't know if i had said well we're

898
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,719
doing this because the government

899
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,599
the

900
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,119
this agency and the federal government

901
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,199
said to do it i don't know that it would

902
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,359
have registered quite as solidly

903
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,359
and that's that's going to be an issue

904
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,159
probably more for smaller organizations

905
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,480
like ours than it might be for some

906
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,480
place that is a little bit larger and is

907
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
and is more in tune

908
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,239
with uh

909
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,638
government requirements
