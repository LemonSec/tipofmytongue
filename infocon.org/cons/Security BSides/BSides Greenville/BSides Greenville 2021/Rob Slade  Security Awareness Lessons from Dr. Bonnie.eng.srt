1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:06,879
okay

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,279
um

3
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,000
right uh here is all the information

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,880
that you need about me in the qr code

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,800
which you can

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,359
safely scan and and collect all that

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,000
information in

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
as long as you maintain full awareness

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
of the fact that i started my career in

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
security researching

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
malware and computer viruses and i know

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,079
every

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,640
possible way that there is to

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,680
uh get someone to install malware on

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,280
their machine

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,399
um

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,200
but enough about me uh this is a

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,280
security awareness lessons from dr

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,239
bonnie

20
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,160
uh subtitle why i'm losing all the

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,680
respect that i've built up over four

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,680
decades for von palmer and why i never

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,079
had any respect for her to adjustment

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,960
uh

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,760
that

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,640
may become clearer as we get into it

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,199
you will not know who uh von palmer and

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,359
richard zusman are they are

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,319
uh

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,159
reporters journalists media

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,370
personalities in

32
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,640
[Music]

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,159
the vancouver area i am

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,479
not only uh not an american and

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,720
therefore an untrustworthy foreigner but

36
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,920
i am

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,880
on the wet coast of north america so i'm

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,520
in vancouver british columbia canada

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,119
uh and uh that uh

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,240
will become uh somewhat important so uh

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,159
some of these references will be a bit

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,720
odd uh from your perspective

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,520
um i i just like to say that it's kind

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,920
of interesting that

45
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,079
besides greenville while i certainly

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,680
respect all the work that they've done

47
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,799
in uh

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,119
putting together uh b-sides during these

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,799
difficult times

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,280
uh it it is kind of interesting that

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,079
this out of the various uh proposals

52
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,399
that i made was the one that they picked

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,600
anyways

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,399
uh who is dr bonnie and why should you

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,640
care and and what does this have to do

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
with security awareness

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,160
uh the dr bonnie show as as some of us

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,878
call it is the um

59
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,959
uh covid updates from uh bonnie henry dr

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,959
bonnie henry who is our chief

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,680
medical health officer here in bc

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,080
um and uh this is uh not just

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
interesting in in terms of uh kovid but

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,440
it's really it's been amazing as a

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,879
master class a real master class in

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
effective communication of difficult

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,840
topics and situations

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
and um

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
this is

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,879
uh there are so many lessons so many

71
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,760
pointers so many so much um

72
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,640
you can take away from the dr bonnie

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,720
show in terms of

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,080
um

75
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,040
uh

76
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,319
how to to get across what may be a very

77
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,239
complex topic and of course this is

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,159
exactly the uh situation that we face

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,480
with regard to security awareness if

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,800
we're going to try and do it

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,760
um

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,800
the

83
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,239
youtube channel and i have um

84
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,040
also uh uh pumped uh all of these urls

85
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,040
into the the chat area so uh you can go

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,120
and pick up that there you don't have to

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,040
screenshot the the slides although

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,360
you're perfectly

89
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
free to do that if you wish

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,080
um

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,959
the

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,640
uh

93
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,560
the dr bonnie show is is there on

94
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,599
youtube but this is in fact the the bc

95
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,000
government communications channel

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,040
and so you have to pick out uh the the

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,720
covid uh update uh sessions from it um

98
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,360
but it's all there now uh i

99
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,159
i must say of course um this being the

100
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,840
bc government they may not have made

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,920
this stuff available worldwide and you

102
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,200
may have to go to a vpn and and set your

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,640
location to canada to uh to get it

104
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,000
um but it's it's well well worth looking

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,720
at that that is the background material

106
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,600
uh what we're doing here uh here is uh

107
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,560
dr bonnie henry um this is in fact not

108
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
just a a nice picture of her this is the

109
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,680
cover of her second book uh entitled

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,639
become

111
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,199
be kind become be safe

112
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
um and

113
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,639
it is uh

114
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,840
an interesting book in uh that while it

115
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,479
uh outlines what uh

116
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,479
actions were taken at the the beginning

117
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,240
of the pandemic and the decisions that

118
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,280
were made

119
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,479
um it also outlines uh some of those

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,639
decisions which related to exactly how

121
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,560
they were going to put together the the

122
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
covet updates and again

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,639
the decisions outlined there and the

124
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,360
rationale for those decisions

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,400
has a lot to do with

126
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,440
um security awareness and the principles

127
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,320
and of effective communication

128
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,639
uh that are important to

129
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,800
uh security awareness

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,479
so um that is uh

131
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,600
again uh something that i would i would

132
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,440
recommend and that

133
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,039
of course is easily

134
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,400
uh accessible to any of you who are

135
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
interested in that

136
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,960
uh

137
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,360
you can you can go and get that um

138
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,440
that as i said it's her second book her

139
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,320
first book is also uh well worth reading

140
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,800
and uh that is entitled soap and water

141
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
and common sense

142
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,919
um

143
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:40,960
anyways we're talking about

144
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,039
communication uh this is an interesting

145
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,919
definition which i recently got from

146
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,680
somebody who obviously

147
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,039
uh was

148
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,080
into evolutionary biology the process by

149
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
which a transmitter

150
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,639
that's me sends a signal

151
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,120
designed to manipulate a receiver that's

152
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,240
you

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,520
a receiver's actions in order to improve

154
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,680
the transmitters that's me

155
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,319
inclusive fitness and and so uh here i

156
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,960
am uh giving you a presentation

157
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
at b-sides and of course the real

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,199
purpose of this is to enhance my

159
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,800
inclusive fitness

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,639
uh i'm not quite sure how that works out

161
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,479
but it's kind of an interesting way to

162
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,479
look at things

163
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,240
now in

164
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,880
in regard to the pandemic of course one

165
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,000
of the

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,039
uh

167
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,160
major problems that we have come to see

168
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,960
is

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,880
uh miss and disinformation this has

170
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,080
been

171
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,240
a huge a huge problem in in the pandemic

172
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,160
but it's also a problem of course in

173
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,199
security awareness and in the

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,000
uh issues that we

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
have to face

176
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
if we're going to pursue

177
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
security awareness we have to make sure

178
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,680
that the information that we provide is

179
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
right

180
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,599
and

181
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,360
it's it's interesting to look at the

182
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,039
reasons why miss and disinformation are

183
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,360
spread are created and spread there is

184
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,360
of course just plain ignorance um

185
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,199
and uh

186
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,759
that is that is one of the aspects

187
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,479
but

188
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,919
another reason is fear and and this goes

189
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,000
back to as i say you know i started out

190
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
in computer

191
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,560
uh

192
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
viral programs research the malware

193
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,000
research

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,240
and one of the interesting things that i

195
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,440
saw as as i started out in that research

196
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,319
was that people weren't doing anything

197
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,520
about

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,560
viruses as a matter of fact um and i was

199
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
just talking about this yesterday on

200
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,479
another presentation

201
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,400
um

202
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,560
i was um

203
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
in the early days the conferences were

204
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
few and far between not like they are

205
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,400
nowadays but um

206
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,960
uh and and one was being put together

207
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,560
and i contacted the the people uh

208
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,240
putting the program together

209
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,560
and offered a

210
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
presentation on my research into uh

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,840
viral programs

212
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,080
and they turned me down um they didn't

213
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,479
think that computer viruses were in fact

214
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,400
a security problem

215
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
um and and that was

216
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
one of the things that i saw that

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,479
because people didn't understand what uh

218
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,639
viruses were in those early days and

219
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,840
there's an awful lot of people who still

220
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,120
don't understand

221
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,240
um

222
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,919
that

223
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,479
they decided what to do about them was

224
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,919
nothing because they didn't want to do

225
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,399
the wrong thing and again that's that's

226
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,000
a similar situation we see with the

227
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,399
pandemic a lot of people don't

228
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,679
take

229
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,080
appropriate precautions because they

230
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,160
fear taking any actions in case it might

231
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
be the wrong action

232
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,640
um and so that's it's a very interesting

233
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
one and one of the the lessons that we

234
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,080
have to learn and one of the lessons

235
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
from uh the dr bonnie show is

236
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,480
uh

237
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,959
reduce the fear

238
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,880
there's also legitimate contention of

239
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,480
ideas there uh

240
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,399
one of the uh

241
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,399
interesting uh things recently of course

242
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,839
is ivermectin

243
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,680
um and

244
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,160
uh there are some interesting theories

245
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,000
and hypotheses about why ivermectin

246
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,120
might

247
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,760
uh be a treatment for uh kovid um

248
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,480
the unfortunate uh situation is that the

249
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
the studies that have been done

250
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,519
um have all been done in a fragmentary

251
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,760
and partial basis and there really is

252
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,959
still no evidence uh really one way or

253
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,560
another whether ivermectin uh does in

254
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,160
fact treat people although

255
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,279
um

256
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,240
uh

257
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
the the one piece of information we do

258
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,240
know is certainly you know a lot of

259
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,000
people are taking out your mechan and a

260
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,519
lot more are getting sick and going in

261
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,000
the hospital from ivermectin poisoning

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,640
then are getting better from uh you know

263
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,160
not having covet

264
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
um

265
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
another aspect is is fraud and there are

266
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,120
people who are uh you know out there

267
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,800
just uh pushing

268
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,240
uh

269
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,560
supposed remedies um

270
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,800
trying to obtain money from people by by

271
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,160
selling these things

272
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,079
and then there are you know outright

273
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,000
attacks that that there you know there's

274
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,320
always in in the midst of any disaster

275
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,920
just people who want to see the world

276
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,519
burn and and so

277
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,000
uh different aspects of that

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,040
now again as we we uh talk about

279
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,519
security awareness um one of the things

280
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,720
that we have to watch out for is

281
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,519
uh security theater and and

282
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,480
uh

283
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,040
the the people you know security theater

284
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
is in general is

285
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,839
um

286
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,959
something that uh you you are seen to be

287
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,720
doing something even if what you're

288
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,560
doing isn't in fact

289
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,079
useful at all

290
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,959
um so the the powers that be we have

291
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,640
seen we well we don't see this much

292
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,079
anymore but certainly at the beginning

293
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,079
of the pandemic you saw all kinds of

294
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,600
these things where people were out

295
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,880
spraying and fogging in in open areas

296
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,200
uh trying to get rid of the virus and

297
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,880
and as any

298
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,200
uh

299
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,760
infectious disease specialist will tell

300
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,279
you

301
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,880
there's nothing you could spray or fog

302
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,120
around open areas that would kill the

303
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,440
virus that wouldn't kill you or at least

304
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
you know seriously uh harm you

305
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
uh so

306
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,880
you know there there are issues about

307
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,480
you know we have to make sure that we

308
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,720
have accurate information and we're not

309
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,079
pretending

310
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,240
that what we're giving people is is

311
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,279
going to help at the same time now well

312
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,959
as increasingly as the

313
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,320
pandemic has gone on um the the media

314
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
and and this is where uh

315
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,079
zusman and palmer coming

316
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:48,880
uh

317
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,600
the the media has decided to jump on

318
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
this and you know oh good the

319
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,959
authorities aren't perfect in the middle

320
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,200
of all of this ghastly mess let's point

321
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
that out and harp on it and and of

322
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,240
course

323
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,079
uh you know that means that they are

324
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,160
selling more papers you know it's kind

325
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,839
of like the media is is doing what

326
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,680
facebook is doing which is

327
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,639
um you know we could give accurate and

328
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,680
well-researched information but it's um

329
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,480
much more profitable to get everybody

330
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,160
riled up and upset

331
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,920
um and uh buying the the papers or or

332
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,959
watching the television news whatever it

333
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,240
may be

334
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,200
uh because we're creating a sensation

335
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,720
even though we're not helping the

336
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,399
situation

337
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,600
so

338
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,360
at last to security awareness

339
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,399
now

340
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,680
um security awareness has a bit of a bad

341
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,600
reputation of

342
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
so many people

343
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,120
uh and i've encountered this over and

344
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,160
over again um i i started out basically

345
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,800
as i well i was a teacher uh i still am

346
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,760
a teacher

347
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,200
here i'm teaching you um i i was a

348
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,839
teacher in elementary school before i

349
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,800
ever got into uh computer security not

350
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,000
quite but

351
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,839
um

352
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,760
and uh

353
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,560
so from my perspective you know teaching

354
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,000
training uh awareness um training

355
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,880
is

356
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,760
important but but so many people in our

357
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,120
industry

358
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,360
uh say no it's not important it doesn't

359
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,600
work well of course security awareness

360
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
is not perfect

361
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,959
but it it does you know it's a lot

362
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,480
better than people give a credit for

363
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,560
because most of the people who say that

364
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
security awareness doesn't work simply

365
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
assume it doesn't work

366
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,800
and don't try it

367
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,120
and when you try it

368
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,279
and this is one of the lessons

369
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,040
from the dr bonnie show

370
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,160
it really has a serious and significant

371
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,279
impact

372
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,519
so security awareness let's you know

373
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,360
when we're trying to do it

374
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,920
um do you need charisma i mean you know

375
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,839
look at me here do i have any charisma

376
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,560
absolutely not no uh and when you watch

377
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,800
dr bonnie show no uh dr bonnie and

378
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,120
adrian dixon are not exactly charismatic

379
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,079
people

380
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,279
um do you need bells and whistles um i

381
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,440
here we are you know there's no bells

382
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,279
and whistles i got the slides you will

383
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,360
notice there's a little bit of graphics

384
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,519
here but mostly it's just text

385
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,360
so i you know i don't have any bells and

386
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
whistles

387
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,600
um humor um well i hope that i do but

388
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,120
certainly the dr bonnie show doesn't

389
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,199
intentionally do any uh and and you

390
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,760
don't actually need that you

391
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,279
you can

392
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,360
do security awareness very very

393
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,160
effectively without

394
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,880
trying to be saturday night live

395
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,800
so uh

396
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,399
first thing

397
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,800
don't panic and that's the first thing

398
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,160
to tell

399
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
uh people when you are doing security

400
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,440
awareness when you are doing your

401
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,920
security awareness training as i said

402
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,839
reduce the fear

403
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,760
make sure that um you are telling people

404
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,279
the threats

405
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,639
but at the same time you are saying you

406
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,839
know that the situation can be managed

407
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,160
how the situation can be met what are

408
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,959
the tools and make sure that those tools

409
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,279
are available to everybody

410
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,240
you know don't don't go and say

411
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,760
don't worry

412
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,130
kovid for example can be handled by

413
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,040
[Music]

414
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,959
the

415
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,279
monoclonal antibody stuff because that's

416
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,279
not available to anyone it's hugely

417
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,399
expensive

418
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,720
um much much easier of course to go and

419
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,800
just get a vaccine shot

420
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,000
so

421
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,959
uh

422
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,639
what do we do then what are some of the

423
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,759
lessons uh that we do in security

424
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,040
awareness well

425
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
uh repetition

426
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,959
is one of the first just simply key you

427
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,880
know

428
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,600
get simple points and repeat and repeat

429
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,880
and repeat those points

430
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,199
i can remember

431
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,440
we have a

432
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,720
traffic

433
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,079
radio station

434
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,360
uh here in the vancouver area and um of

435
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,560
course they've got tons and tons and

436
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,560
tons of ads and uh as we were driving

437
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,399
somewhere one day one of the events came

438
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,320
on it was for maple ridge motors and and

439
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,480
it just kept on repeating repeating

440
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,959
repeating the name of the company and my

441
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,120
wife uh turned to me and said that's

442
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,680
that's a ridiculous ad and i said no

443
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,839
actually it's you know studies have

444
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,240
shown that it's a very effective ad

445
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,639
all you have to do is is repeat a simple

446
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,199
point you are going to remember the name

447
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,720
of that

448
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,519
company for years and i was right

449
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,959
because i still remember the name of

450
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,120
that company even though we've never

451
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,399
dealt with them

452
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,279
uh so simple repetition react you know

453
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,360
make sure that you have simple points

454
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,920
repeat them repeat them repeat them that

455
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,720
is

456
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,399
uh one of the

457
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,440
essences of security awareness training

458
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,800
how to do it

459
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,720
now consistency

460
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,680
um

461
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,040
this has been

462
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,800
really interesting and one of the big

463
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,880
lessons again from the pandemic that it

464
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,599
gives us in terms of security awareness

465
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,079
uh the information has been constantly

466
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
changing i mean after all

467
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,359
uh coronaviruses are class of viruses

468
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,880
that we didn't even know existed uh

469
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,720
until the 60s

470
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,520
and certainly uh

471
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,839
covet itself well we you know we saw

472
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,200
sars back in 2009 i believe it was

473
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,039
maybe a little earlier than that um but

474
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
you know we we didn't have a big

475
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,760
outbreak then and and so the research um

476
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,440
really didn't go on

477
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,640
now

478
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,880
you know this is a pandemic everybody is

479
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,440
researching it and the information is

480
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,520
changing all the time because we are

481
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,400
finding out new things about

482
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,320
uh the virus and of course the the

483
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
different mutations the mutations

484
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,840
themselves you know now we're looking at

485
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
the delta variant

486
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
um this is like you know two and a half

487
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,760
times uh more infective more lethal than

488
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,240
the original uh virus that we were

489
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
dealing with when

490
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,240
the pandemic first started

491
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,280
so um you know that is changing that is

492
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,120
changing all the time we didn't have

493
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,720
vaccines at the beginning now we have

494
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,360
vaccines um some of the stuff is not

495
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,799
changing and hand washing is still

496
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,320
effective uh masking at the beginning

497
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,720
of the uh the pandemic was not a big

498
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,120
issue now we know that uh

499
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,520
the um

500
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
uh aerosol well

501
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
is it aerosols i can well droplet

502
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,799
transmission anyways

503
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,960
um is uh much more of a factor than

504
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,160
uh

505
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,039
was

506
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,760
thought you know a year and a half ago

507
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,440
so uh

508
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,679
that that information that kind of

509
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,160
information is changing and uh the

510
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,000
importance of different aspects of the

511
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,640
different tools is is changing the

512
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,960
information is changing

513
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,480
what the

514
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,640
dr bonnie has has done in in the updates

515
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,559
is to

516
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,280
provide some sense of consistency by

517
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,360
maintaining the format

518
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,559
um

519
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,360
the

520
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,880
uh

521
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,960
the format hasn't changed the uh you

522
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,760
know it's just it's uh bonnie henry and

523
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
adrian dix um who's our minister of

524
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,400
health that's why he's on there and and

525
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,320
those are the people who are involved in

526
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,120
and and they give a presentation

527
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,160
um

528
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,240
very often the presentation follows a

529
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,600
very fixed

530
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,960
uh format with uh

531
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,440
data the latest metrics on on the

532
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,600
pandemic um

533
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,120
some discussion of of different aspects

534
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,039
there are various things get reported on

535
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,600
a regular basis

536
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,480
and and then uh questions from from

537
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,080
journalists and they've maintained that

538
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,120
format

539
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,520
for you know almost two years now

540
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,480
and uh that's again you know it's it's

541
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,720
comforting it reduces anxiety

542
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,919
uh from people and and so it provides

543
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,679
for some consistency

544
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,360
in the midst of a situation that's

545
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,880
that's very difficult of course in

546
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,000
security awareness and technology in in

547
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,440
computer security

548
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,840
um we are having to deal with that all

549
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,280
the time you know the situation is

550
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,600
changing different types of malware

551
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,880
being produced different types of

552
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,200
attacks are coming out the the base

553
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,840
technology is changing all the time

554
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,320
um everybody's everybody argues about

555
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,360
you know which

556
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,960
field of technology is changing the

557
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
fastest and i always say that security

558
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
is and has got a lock on that because it

559
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,679
doesn't matter

560
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,480
what

561
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,440
other field of technology is changing

562
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,320
that change has an impact for us in

563
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,440
security

564
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,360
so you know we're facing changing

565
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,960
information all the time

566
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,600
so uh you know find some way to maintain

567
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,760
consistency with regard to what you're

568
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,400
doing in security awareness

569
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
you've got to have patience uh this is

570
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,480
particularly interesting in

571
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
uh and illustrated by the uh question

572
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
period at the end of the the dr bonnie

573
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,200
show uh when the reporters are asking a

574
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,720
question and the same person asked that

575
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,640
say any question for the 140 second time

576
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,559
in a row or when the next reporter asks

577
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,080
the same question that you've just

578
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,880
answered for his her it's seven previous

579
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,480
colleagues um

580
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,280
you know

581
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,720
and dr bonnie never loses her patience

582
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,760
uh she never freaks out over over this

583
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,440
same thing that happens again and again

584
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
and again

585
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600
um

586
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,120
very very uh important lesson to today

587
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,360
learn to answer stupid questions

588
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,600
this was an interesting one where uh one

589
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,520
reporter really did ask a phenomenally

590
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,840
stupid question

591
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,679
uh taking a huge long time to do it and

592
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,600
when he finally finishes dr bonnie just

593
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,720
says no

594
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,559
and then stops talking that was really

595
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,760
interesting

596
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,960
um

597
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,840
so uh

598
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,039
uh social engineering is

599
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,200
we we think of it in in terms of bad

600
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
thing i certainly you know in malware

601
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,799
research we know that you know security

602
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,640
and social engineering is

603
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,679
uh used all the time to get people to

604
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,360
uh install uh malware on their machines

605
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,559
but

606
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,360
social engineering is something that we

607
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
use all the time in education

608
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,919
and uh so use that to your advantage

609
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,320
uh make sure that um you understand uh

610
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,840
your audience

611
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,120
um

612
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,320
uh

613
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,200
use social engineering to to

614
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
uh

615
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,960
tune your materials uh it's interesting

616
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,760
uh adrian dicks um came up with this

617
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
this simple slogan bend the curve not

618
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,000
the rules you remember bending the curve

619
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,480
back at the beginning of the uh pandemic

620
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,760
people were talking about bending the

621
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,200
curve bending the curve

622
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,880
so bend the curve not the rules and of

623
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,480
course you know you set up mandates you

624
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,159
set up rules you set a block down

625
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,840
restrictions that sort of thing and

626
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,360
people always try to find some way

627
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,039
around it so you know here was a

628
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,880
reminder you know we got to keep the

629
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,480
curve low uh don't don't bend the rules

630
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,520
uh so simple slogans

631
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,000
are an example of social engineering

632
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,760
again you know keep the point simple

633
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,280
repeat it repeat it repeat it

634
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,799
um

635
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,320
some uh

636
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,280
moving into other aspects of security

637
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,880
awareness and different topics that we

638
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,159
might be addressing

639
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,480
uh risk management um

640
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,640
uh this is one of the things from risk

641
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,320
management which i've

642
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,679
found is

643
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,320
uh has has not made its way into the

644
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,960
public consciousness in the pandemic

645
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
um and that is the fact that

646
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,880
uh none of the tools that we have are

647
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,320
perfect and so the aspect of of layered

648
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,400
security defense in depth that topic

649
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,080
really hasn't come through

650
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,520
and you don't get to choose it's not one

651
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,840
of it's all of and staying at home

652
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,000
distance hand washing mats no parties

653
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,159
you know none of those individually are

654
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,559
perfect but all of them together

655
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,200
provide you with a lot of protection

656
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
and it's the same with the information

657
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,760
security you don't get to get one free

658
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
click on a drive by download if you

659
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,600
choose a good password just you know it

660
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,360
does not work

661
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,840
so again you know those kinds of lessons

662
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,080
are some of the the ones that we have to

663
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,760
uh

664
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,480
lean on in in security awareness stick

665
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,279
to the basic basic principles but

666
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,520
use illustrations

667
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,120
uh from other areas if necessary

668
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,440
to make those principles

669
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,640
clear

670
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,039
to people

671
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,600
again from risk management they

672
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,559
to those

673
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,880
scenes it's fairly simple math

674
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,880
uh to prove the greater good to delay

675
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,080
the second dose

676
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,200
this is again something um that bonnie

677
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,799
henry uh

678
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,039
uh chose to do here in british columbia

679
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,200
a lot of people were upset that that she

680
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,279
was trying to roll out a lot of first

681
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,000
dose get a lot of people uh vaccinated

682
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,480
not holding back the vaccines to provide

683
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,240
for second doses but you know getting

684
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,279
people out

685
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,919
there uh with their first doses and then

686
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:12,960
are

687
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,799
rolling out the second doses and that

688
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,520
has come home to roost now months and

689
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,919
months later uh because we're finding

690
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,799
that

691
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,640
uh here in bc

692
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,520
um

693
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,840
we have a

694
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,360
longer uh

695
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,120
length of protection times

696
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,440
uh for those who are fully vaccinated

697
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
than those who you know got their second

698
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
dose right around the three week markets

699
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,919
again this is one of the interesting uh

700
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,080
pieces of research that's uh come out of

701
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,840
the vaccine uh situation

702
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,799
uh

703
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,960
cost benefit analysis now this is this

704
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,039
is really interesting um

705
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,960
we in security of course um security

706
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,600
serves the business so in

707
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,640
in the cost-benefit analysis of

708
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,159
um staying in isolation versus reopening

709
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,919
the economy you know you would think

710
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,640
that uh

711
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,400
security service business we would be on

712
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,720
the side of reopening the economy but

713
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,799
life safety is always the number one

714
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,080
priority if

715
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,520
for example you're going and writing the

716
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,360
cisb

717
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,960
exam so uh no there are higher

718
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,679
priorities than reopening the economy uh

719
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,360
at times so again

720
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,320
uh some risk management decisions there

721
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,200
um

722
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,840
again um one of the situations that

723
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,640
um we need to

724
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
point out in in security awareness

725
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,720
training is is that

726
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
things are not going to be perfect

727
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,559
and this comes up in for example

728
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,480
business continuity planning

729
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,520
and

730
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,440
situations like that incident response

731
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,400
planning

732
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,039
uh nobody is perfect and and emergency

733
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,720
management is for emergency and uh

734
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,240
this uh this has been amply

735
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,200
illustrated uh not just by the pandemic

736
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,559
but um the uh situation over the summer

737
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,440
i mean we had the heat dome uh my entire

738
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,159
province caught fire um you guys have

739
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,080
had uh you know hurricanes and floods

740
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,880
and and situations like that and and so

741
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,679
emergency management has has been uh

742
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,320
very much tested and found wanting in in

743
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
a number of situations

744
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,399
as i said you know it's it it's not

745
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,919
perfect and so again

746
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,000
when we are dealing with security

747
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,559
awareness we need to

748
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,200
at least make people aware

749
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,679
of that fact that you know

750
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,520
this is going to try and do the best

751
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,760
that people can but it's not going to

752
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,240
address every aspect you know after all

753
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,960
we are in the middle of a disaster uh

754
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,919
something is going to be going wrong

755
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,080
uh by the way in in regard to emergency

756
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,200
management

757
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,159
um

758
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,279
and and again i put this um into the the

759
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,760
stuff i pumped into the chat channel

760
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,360
um

761
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,480
uh

762
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,399
search and rescue north shore from the

763
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,159
knowledge network here in bc and

764
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,000
knowledge.ca is the uh the site to go to

765
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,360
uh again um i understand from other

766
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,880
people that i've talked to that this is

767
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,840
limited to uh people in canada so

768
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,919
um

769
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,200
you will need to get a vpn and set your

770
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
location to canada in order to get

771
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,440
access to this but when you do go and

772
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,279
search for north uh search and rescue

773
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,919
north shore wonderful wonderful uh

774
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,399
five-part documentary series uh

775
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,559
outlining the uh the search and rescues

776
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,039
team here on the north shore um and it's

777
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:45,760
a

778
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,640
also a gorgeous gorgeous piece of

779
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,840
filmmaking

780
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,080
um and when they

781
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,399
used multiple cameras even connected to

782
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,640
ropes and and things like that

783
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,559
um and uh edited together in a

784
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,640
phenomenally uh good fashion and of

785
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,159
course it's shot here in the north shore

786
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,399
so it's it's absolutely gorgeous scenery

787
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,399
that you're dealing with

788
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,480
uh but lots and lots of good uh lessons

789
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
about security management there

790
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,440
um

791
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,360
one of the questions that the uh

792
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,919
reporters keep on asking how vicious are

793
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,360
you going to get with people who break

794
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,520
distancing rules or whatever the the

795
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,559
rule du jour you know vaccine mandates

796
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,640
masks whatever it may be

797
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,720
um and and this

798
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,559
uh question gets asked over and over

799
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,720
again with different wordies and

800
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,799
and and that sort of thing

801
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,039
and uh very interestingly uh gain um

802
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,679
uh bonnie henry has

803
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,279
refused to get involved with the the

804
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,080
divisiveness of of this fight

805
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,159
and she has

806
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,080
uh

807
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,480
an amazing variety of ways

808
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,279
to to do that to to get out of this trap

809
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,480
and it is a trap really um

810
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,279
she

811
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,279
uh certainly illustrates the principle

812
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,200
that you catch more flies with honey

813
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,880
than vinegar again

814
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,039
reduce the anxiety

815
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,559
um do not attack people do not say you

816
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,600
are bad for choosing a bad password but

817
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,799
you know

818
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,279
your life your work will benefit from

819
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,480
choosing a good password um

820
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,120
take that kind of position you know very

821
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,840
very important lesson uh one of the

822
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,799
important social engineering aspects

823
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,080
of uh security awareness training to

824
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,520
uh to do that now as i say uh security

825
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,080
awareness training has been unregarded

826
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
in uh

827
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,000
in our industry

828
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,760
um

829
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,720
and

830
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,720
the dr bonnie show uh bonnie henry has

831
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,000
uh consistently taken the position

832
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,840
that uh

833
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,600
you need to educate rather than mandate

834
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,480
she would much rather

835
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,120
provide the information in the updates

836
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,080
then

837
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,519
uh

838
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,880
uh you know

839
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,159
issue another set of restrictions

840
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,880
and and a lot of people certainly a lot

841
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,039
of people in the in the media have taken

842
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,320
issue with that and said this is the

843
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,159
wrong way to go but

844
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,600
bc is doing comparatively well

845
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,440
and and so you know

846
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,120
very much thank you

847
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
uh to dr bonnie

848
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,840
for

849
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,120
proving that security awareness does

850
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,039
actually work

851
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,360
because when you look at the

852
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,399
restrictions

853
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,880
bc has never had

854
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,799
a lockdown

855
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,120
that was as

856
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,399
severe

857
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,720
as many many other places

858
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,200
um even right now we're we're in a

859
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,440
fourth wave and and we do have some

860
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,000
local restrictions in in local areas and

861
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,919
and certainly uh with uh thanksgiving uh

862
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,440
this weekend you know that's when we

863
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,200
have thanksgiving it's when there is an

864
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,799
actual harvest not you know later in

865
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,279
november when you guys have it but

866
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,720
um

867
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,440
the

868
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,360
uh you know and they've said you know

869
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,399
don't have

870
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,880
big multi-family parties this year this

871
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,720
is not the the year to do it but they

872
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
haven't mandated it you know there's no

873
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,200
thanksgiving police going around and

874
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,720
making sure that people aren't gathering

875
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,399
in in large numbers

876
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,360
but bc is still doing comparatively well

877
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,279
uh relative to a lot of of other places

878
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,200
um and i can prove that uh because i

879
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,679
would talk about metrics now um one of

880
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,720
the the issues of metrics um

881
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,360
uh a lot of people are are on this

882
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,200
transparency and accountability

883
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
bandwagon and they want them the metrics

884
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,480
they want lots and lots and lots of

885
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,519
metrics

886
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,399
well metrics should be useful

887
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,600
network metrics um

888
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,960
uh are not just numbers having lots of

889
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,679
numbers and providing lots of numbers uh

890
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,200
is you know it

891
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,080
is not necessarily useful this this was

892
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,559
an interesting uh cartoon that i i found

893
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,480
recently the company notified you of a

894
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,399
breach and shared the incident details

895
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,480
and insights on the adversary but they

896
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,559
didn't share that data but you have what

897
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,960
you need if we had forensic images maybe

898
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,200
we'd find more maybe likely not but all

899
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,600
data isn't realistic and sharing it with

900
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,760
others poses other risks well they

901
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,600
aren't sharing then you know this is

902
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,200
what the the media is is constantly uh

903
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,360
harping on

904
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,279
oh by the way if there's no other way

905
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,080
that i can get you to take uh coveted uh

906
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,360
seriously um i i don't know why

907
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,159
this

908
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,640
uh issue has not gotten more air time

909
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,399
with the media if the media really wants

910
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,399
to to do it they would uh point out the

911
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,399
fact that uh covert 19 is linked to

912
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,559
erectile dysfunction and i'm sure that

913
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,399
would improve uh you know people's uh

914
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,799
uh vaccine hesitancy and and that sort

915
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,000
of thing but

916
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,240
um

917
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,760
in terms of the the format of what

918
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,119
you're doing i talked about the

919
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,639
consistency here

920
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,960
uh use an authority not an authority

921
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,079
figure

922
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,918
um

923
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,639
in uh i don't know what it was uh down

924
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,119
in south carolina uh of course everybody

925
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,719
uh saw uh new york's presentations and

926
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,639
and they weren't bad um

927
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,079
but you know that was uh como um

928
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,480
uh front and center and and he certainly

929
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,079
had specialists back him up and that

930
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,639
sort of thing but here in bc

931
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,359
we had dr bonnie we didn't have premier

932
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,159
horror

933
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,320
uh he wasn't on deck uh adrian dix was

934
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
there he's the house minister but not

935
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,800
the premier you know and and so we had

936
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,280
the authorities not authority figures

937
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,159
and uh personally um you know i i like

938
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,760
speaking to b-sides here because we

939
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,079
don't get the technical presentations

940
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,680
from the vp of marketing that we get in

941
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,880
so many other

942
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,480
uh conferences and and uh

943
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,200
that's you know an issue there but again

944
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,560
back to metrics

945
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,839
um

946
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,240
lots of metrics in the pandemic uh case

947
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,000
counts case rates doubling rates death

948
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,920
rates case per capita hospitalization

949
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,200
i'd see

950
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,599
lots and lots of numbers um

951
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,000
positivity is is one of the things oh

952
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,280
and and by the way

953
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
um

954
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,839
in terms of metrics um

955
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,079
there is a book by broad bean hanson

956
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,079
pragmatic security metrics and and

957
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,079
pragmatic is an acronym

958
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,720
and uh they have the the different uh

959
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,520
uh

960
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,320
terms and and uh you know

961
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,520
uh factors that uh you should have in in

962
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,280
your metrics and you know relevant

963
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,000
meaningful accurate or part of them

964
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,520
in there um but uh positivity rate is is

965
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,040
one of the ones that that people have

966
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,839
been relying on in terms of the pandemic

967
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,240
uh here in bc we've got a big film

968
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,200
industry

969
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,280
um and uh they were allowed to reopen uh

970
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,240
fairly early uh got going um

971
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,160
they have very uh

972
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,200
rigorous uh controls um

973
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,520
but uh it's it's interesting they do so

974
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,960
much testing

975
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,119
in the film industry that it actually

976
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,119
skews our positivity rates for the

977
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,960
province as a whole it's it's kind of

978
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,359
interesting so you you need to know what

979
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,680
the the metrics actually do mean um

980
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,839
again the metrics and and from the

981
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,359
pandemic um in terms of the covet

982
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,240
updates bonnie henry uh

983
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,920
has uh consistently uh provided modeling

984
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,800
but refused to look at projected deaths

985
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,359
and you know again she uh

986
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,599
discusses that in her book you know was

987
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,920
this going to be helpful no it was not

988
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,280
you know modeling

989
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,240
uh helps you planning for various things

990
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,720
in in

991
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,839
the

992
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,440
medical industry

993
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,720
but projected deaths you know while

994
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,760
it's great and sensational for the media

995
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,680
it's really not helpful for anybody

996
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,839
other than undertakers

997
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:12,640
so

998
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,440
uh but in terms of the metrics um and

999
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,040
now this this

1000
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
slide these next couple of slides are a

1001
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,320
little bit uh

1002
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,040
old now but um they

1003
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,400
uh the numbers still uh still hold

1004
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,280
uh as of march comparing uh per capita

1005
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,359
to the rest of canada bc should have had

1006
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,920
three thousand debt and comparing us to

1007
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,000
you guys in the us bc should have had 6

1008
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,599
000 debt and instead bc has saved over a

1009
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,200
thousand you know just over a thousand

1010
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,359
dead at that time when i made this slide

1011
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,160
so dr bonnie has saved 5 000 lives at

1012
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,720
that point and continues to save

1013
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,240
uh to this day on an ongoing basis uh bc

1014
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,079
plateaued at 500 cases per day since

1015
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,760
november and that has remained

1016
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,640
remarkably consistent uh it's fluctuated

1017
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,160
up and down a little bit but

1018
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,200
um

1019
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,599
dr bonnie said to vaccinate the old the

1020
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,920
deaths per day in november were 20 per

1021
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,880
day

1022
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,560
the deaths per day at the end of march

1023
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,400
were five and that has remained

1024
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,800
remarkably consistent so dr bonnie is

1025
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,599
saving 15 lives every day

1026
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,000
that the decisions that she made the

1027
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,079
principles that i've been talking about

1028
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,480
um in terms of security awareness that

1029
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
are illustrated by

1030
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,960
the dr bonnie show um

1031
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,720
those are factors that um illustrate the

1032
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,560
importance and and and

1033
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,520
prove

1034
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,800
the importance of security awareness

1035
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,240
educate them and mandate education saves

1036
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,599
lives

1037
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,200
um

1038
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,440
a few other points uh

1039
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,200
change up your your slogans and that

1040
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,800
sort of thing

1041
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,200
look at security awareness

1042
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,760
in the same way you do advertising last

1043
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,839
year's commercials are boring come up

1044
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,839
with a new slogan an illustration a new

1045
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,240
analogy but of course stick to the

1046
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,720
essentials the the basic points uh that

1047
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,640
we've talked about earlier

1048
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,720
um functional versus assurance

1049
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,400
requirements and

1050
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,680
um

1051
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,920
i this is something that we don't talk

1052
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,480
about often enough in in security

1053
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,720
functional is is our actual security

1054
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,119
tools assurance requirements are the

1055
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,599
ways that we can demonstrate that either

1056
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,280
the tools are working or that they're

1057
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,079
doing what we in fact want them to do

1058
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,720
uh for example um

1059
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,280
you go to a restaurant um hand hygiene

1060
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,520
is important you don't want anybody uh

1061
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,200
you know

1062
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,280
making your food with hands that are

1063
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,680
unsanitary and therefore you know

1064
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,040
uh getting you sick by doing that um and

1065
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,280
of course you go in all the restrooms

1066
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,040
and they say you know employees need to

1067
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,359
wash their hands but

1068
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,880
yes that's a functional security

1069
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,480
requirement but it doesn't give us any

1070
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,599
assurance requirement you go to a subway

1071
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,440
and you see they put on those gloves

1072
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,760
cheap little little gloves plastic bag

1073
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
gloves

1074
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,359
but you can actually see that they have

1075
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,760
the gloves on so you know the functional

1076
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,160
requirement of hand hygiene is there but

1077
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,839
you also have the additional assurance

1078
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,000
requirement of actually seeing the

1079
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,280
gloves

1080
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,319
and this comes out in a variety of ways

1081
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,440
um

1082
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,319
uh

1083
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,319
mass mandates in schools interesting

1084
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,440
thing um

1085
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,280
the the functional we're looking at

1086
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
isolation we're looking at mass physical

1087
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,200
distance i mean they're all problems in

1088
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,800
schools you know we're we're putting

1089
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,720
kids together hand washing is probably

1090
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,240
okay because

1091
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
kids can make a game out of anything or

1092
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,839
you can make a game out of anything in a

1093
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,440
game that's that's

1094
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,520
a good security awareness point make a

1095
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,520
you know game out of things

1096
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,480
um

1097
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,119
but uh

1098
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,000
in terms of the assurance requirements

1099
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,480
detailed contract tracing is is how we

1100
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,000
can get

1101
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
assurance and we find that even though

1102
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,880
kids are getting more sick these days

1103
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,960
there's still very low transmission in

1104
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,640
schools when you do the

1105
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,800
detailed contact raising as to where

1106
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,000
they got

1107
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,560
uh the infection uh bars versus

1108
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,200
restaurants bars um here in bc we had a

1109
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,839
really interesting uh restriction that

1110
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,400
bars had to stop serving alcohols and

1111
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,720
restaurants had to stop serving alcohol

1112
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,560
before 10 pm

1113
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,200
now is alcohol more dangerous after 10

1114
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,480
p.m than it is before 10 p.m yeah but

1115
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,400
in fact um

1116
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,839
the uh

1117
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,520
looking at the numbers after that

1118
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,760
mandate came into place indicates that

1119
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,480
yes it was very effective so uh

1120
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,000
interesting to look at the functional

1121
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,440
versus assurance requirements

1122
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,280
in terms of security awareness don't

1123
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,839
speak down even complex topics people

1124
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,079
will get it if you explain it properly

1125
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,319
if you can't explain it simply you don't

1126
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,000
understand it well enough and that was

1127
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,400
said by smart person albert einstein

1128
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,560
that also is is quoted in soap and water

1129
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,960
in common sense by dr bonnie henry

1130
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,680
and as i say both of those books are

1131
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,440
very well worth 3d

1132
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,160
um so we're approaching that of our time

1133
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,960
okay okay hopefully i've mentioned

1134
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,200
defense in depth before so

1135
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,359
we don't need to do that um one thing in

1136
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,560
regard to

1137
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,720
the dr bonnie show during the the

1138
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,960
wildfires this summer the bc wildfire

1139
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,480
service tried to have a similar

1140
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
messaging they had metrics they didn't

1141
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,880
have the consistent format the same face

1142
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,319
the messaging and communications with

1143
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,680
the wrestling government that

1144
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,880
unfortunately did not work so again here

1145
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,359
is here is dr bonnie i i really think

1146
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,680
that she has uh done great things for us

1147
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
in the pandemic but also given us a

1148
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,200
great illustration

1149
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,359
of what to do in

1150
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,839
uh security awareness training and her

1151
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,760
mantra be kind

1152
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,119
be calm

1153
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,200
be safe

1154
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,480
that is

1155
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,119
something that uh will help us in

1156
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,440
providing security awareness for all of

1157
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,599
our colleagues
