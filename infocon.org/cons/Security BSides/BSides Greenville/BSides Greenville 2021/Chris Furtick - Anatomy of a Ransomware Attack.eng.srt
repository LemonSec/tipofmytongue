11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,320
bummer conversation to have on a

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,000

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,600
saturday morning most of us are based in

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,840
the greenville upstate area the talks

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,600
that you hear today are from folks who

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,559
are impacting cyber security around the

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,120
globe how cool is that right just just

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,719
think about that for a minute and with

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,559
the work that adam anderson is doing

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,719
we're going to the stratosphere right so

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,559
i think greenville is really important

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,120
um i'm based here just down 85 going

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,719
towards clemson

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,320
i'm here to talk about ransomware which

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,319
is not always a fun topic but we'll try

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,680
to keep it upbeat

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,920
i've got a lot of good information to

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,840
share with you stop me let's have a

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,000
conversation at the end you'll see some

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
contact information you can shoot me an

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,920
email reach me on linkedin sometimes i

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,360
get on the twitter sphere and we can

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,560
talk there but

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,200
email or linkedin are the best spot so

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,720
as you can see from the slide deck here

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,560
we're going to talk about ransomware

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,720
these are tips that you can prepare for

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
and avoid attack so

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,000
i am

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,720
an incident responder so i meet folks in

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,799
the middle of their darkest day often

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
times right their entire environment has

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,400
been locked down with ransomware they're

46
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
in the middle of a malware outbreak

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
it runs a gamut but i will tell you the

48
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,360
majority of the cases that i work

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,880
over the past year have been about

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,320
ransomware

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,920
this talk

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
specifically is about a specific case

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
that we worked just a couple months ago

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
so there'll be some facts that i'll

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,439
share with you uh what you won't hear is

56
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,880
the name of the company we won't talk

57
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,719
about that i'm not being cleared to

58
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,799
mention those things but uh almost

59
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,560
anything else it's an open book so i'll

60
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,320
give you a lot of good details here and

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,639
then we can kind of dig in so we'll keep

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,720
going first off i work for ford list

63
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,599
solutions uh we are proud to be a

64
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,360
nationally certified woman-owned small

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,319
business

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,280
so my boss theresa payton was the first

67
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,599
female cio of the white house she served

68
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,760
under the bush administration so we're

69
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
kind of known for our red teaming

70
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,959
capabilities uh almost everyone in this

71
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,200
in the company has a top secret

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,879
government clearance so we work both in

73
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,440
private industry as well as government

74
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,519

75
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,319
instant response so um

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,239
we'll talk about what that means in just

77
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,160
a few moment few moments but i did want

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,920
to give a shout out to my company that

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,519

80
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,160

82
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,200
again i'm chris fernick i've got about

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,760
10 years of cyber security experience i

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,519
technical editor the last book i worked

88
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,120
on you'll see there is the gpen

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
all-in-one guide so

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
lots of acronyms here i won't uh read

91
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,159
all those things to you i'm really proud

92
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,480
to have been a volunteer for the

93
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,319
greenville b-sides over the past several

94
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,200
years so i'm really happy about um where

95
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,599
where we're going uh with the locals uh

96
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,360
scene one thing that's the most

97
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,959
important thing for you to remember from

98
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,519
this slide though is that my cat smoking

99
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,680
abandoned think i'm really cool man they

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,519
come and whenever they get hungry they

101
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,519
come here and we go snacking it's

102
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,799
amazing so

103
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,519
we'll keep going

104
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,480
uh first off um these are proactive

105
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,080
steps you should take we're going to

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,760
look at this case from two different

107
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,519
perspectives right

108
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,440
the two perspectives are one this

109
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,159
happened to a client of ours uh the

110
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,480
other part is how do you prepare for and

111
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,360
avoid so you don't fall into the same uh

112
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,400
category that that they do so again

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
we're not going to talk about what their

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,080
uh the client name we'll tell you what

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,239
vertical they're in we'll tell you the

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,000
ransom that they did end up paying we'll

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,200
talk a little more about that and what

118
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,760
the negotiation process looks like um

119
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,560
but the the most of the facts that we'll

120
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,199
talk about here uh and i know uh see

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,680
shane edwards smoking uh

122
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,440
smoky in the bandit i i figured he'd

123
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,800
like that one i know he's got a couple

124
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,520
of bandit cars but we'll talk about some

125
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
other cases as well so

126
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,919
we'll keep working here guys

127
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,960
um ransomware for the headline so

128
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,280
i i don't have to tell you guys you are

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,040
here on a saturday morning watching a

130
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,120
security talk you know about ransomware

131
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
you understand kind of the implications

132
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,080
you can't go to any of the websites

133
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,479
on any day and not see a major breach

134
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,280
happen uh within the past 24 hours so

135
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
you see jvc kenwood got hit a couple

136
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,759
days ago by conti

137
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,520
one thing that you see here on the right

138
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,919
is a dark website so

139
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,400
we've seen a significant uptick in name

140
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,880
and shame what that means is when an

141
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
attacker ex-fills data they go to their

142
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,120
dark website

143
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,080
and post that they've got you for ransom

144
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,759
how much data they have of yours and

145
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,080
they give you a countdown what this does

146
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,600
it lets the entire world know that

147
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
you're in the middle of a ransomware

148
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
attack right it also

149
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,039
creates pressure for you to pay that

150
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,800
ransom so that's why the name and change

151
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
sites come up

152
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
we've seen i would say

153
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,800
and i don't know that statistic

154
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,320
from the cases that we've worked but i

155
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,919
would say over the past six months i

156
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,520
can't think of one where they didn't go

157
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,320
to their dark website and post data

158
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,000
about um what the effect stolen from the

159
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,199
client so

160
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,360
you see this one from missouri delta uh

161
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,600
here they threatened to and ultimately

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
release 95 000 patient records right

163
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,199
imagine that 95 000 people having all of

164
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,840
their data um freely available on the

165
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,479
internet now because missouri delta a

166
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,080
didn't have controls in place to begin

167
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,560
with and b didn't pay the ransom so

168
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,520
um

169
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,120
yeah so uh

170
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,440
in the the discord the pearl harbor of

171
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,600
our times i think you're exactly correct

172
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,479
uh and this is an epidemic um

173
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,160
the reason that i believe we've seen

174
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
such a ray a rise in ransomware over the

175
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
past um probably 18 months or so

176
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,840
are the rise of the ransomware

177
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
syndicates right so

178
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,240
we do ransomware as a service now so i

179
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
don't have to know how to break into a

180
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,039
network and traverse the network and

181
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,080
escalate privilege and create malware

182
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,560
and create encryption software

183
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,800
and negotiate um

184
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
you know payment and and launder the

185
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,319
money that way i don't have to do all of

186
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,919
those things i just have to be able to

187
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,840
do one of them and go find a buddy to do

188
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,680
the rest right so we're seeing these

189
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,800
syndicates form look at conti

190
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,319
some of the others

191
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,240
it's really becoming an epidemic

192
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,319
proportion so the barrier to entry is

193
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,240
much lower than it was just a couple

194
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,319
years ago so that's the explosion that

195
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,360
we've seen uh over the past 18 months

196
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,560
we've seen just a significant um rise in

197
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,880
that and if you've not been watching the

198
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,199
news um it's not hard to see those

199
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,280
things if you're not paying attention

200
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,599
we'll keep going uh ransomware by the

201
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,120
numbers these are statistics from

202
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,960
several different reports uh the code

203
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,520
ware report i think is really good um

204
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,919
sophos is decent as well but here are

205
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,360
some things to keep in mind so the

206
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,479
average cost of dealing with a

207
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,800
ransomware attack is 1.85 million

208
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,840
dollars

209
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,319
ransom attacks that threaten leaks 81

210
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,240
percent right so that's the vast

211
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,880
majority the third bullet port i think

212
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,400
is really important because we're seeing

213
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,120
a shift in some of the attacks um what

214
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,080
we call extortion style attacks

215
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
attackers are coming in siphoning off

216
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,520
your data

217
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,360
not bothering to encrypt the rest of the

218
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,280
environment but posting you up on the

219
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,919
dark web and asking you for the ransom

220
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,560
payment they don't have to go through

221
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
and deal with the decryption or anything

222
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,840
else they don't have to encrypt the

223
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
environment wait for that to happen

224
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,039
before uh

225
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,199
they're able to um you know ask for the

226
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,440
money so we've seen a significant uptick

227
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,000
in that it's still not nearly as

228
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
high as what we're seeing ransomware

229
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,680
cases where they encrypt the entire

230
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,000
environment but this is becoming an

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,280
issue so

232
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,879
keep that in mind when you hear

233
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,960
extortion of style attacks and you're

234
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,840
hearing oh we've got all the best um

235
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,560
protection against decrypt or encrypting

236
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,000
all of the data right so some of the

237
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,160
backup softwares and edrs can stop those

238
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
things from happening

239
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,599
if they can siphon off your data do they

240
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,760
really need to go through and encrypt

241
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,200
all of your devices we're seeing a

242
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,880
significant rise there so keep that in

243
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,559
mind the fourth bullet point that you

244
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,559
see there's the average ransom payment

245
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,958
so that's 136 thousand dollars and i

246
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,320
want to talk about that number a little

247
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
bit that number is a bit skewed the

248
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,200
study that this came out of um for the

249
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,320
the cohere blog was taken across the

250
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,200
entire globe um many of those

251
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,839
respondents came from india the average

252
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,200
ransom that they're seeing in india is

253
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,279
about ten thousand dollars per incident

254
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,040
if you were to see that number just for

255
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,880
u.s that the number will be considerably

256
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,959
higher so the average that we're seeing

257
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,480
is anywhere between 450 and 750 000 a

258
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,640
ransom payment per attack so keep that

259
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,040
in mind uh downtime we can talk about

260
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,720
that as well and what that impact is to

261
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,080
the business but

262
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
think about the bottom two

263
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
bullet points if you don't remember

264
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,399
anything uh other than this from this

265
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,240
talk this is important

266
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,160
the top two vectors

267
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,680
are email fish which is 40 percent um

268
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,200
and expose remote access 37

269
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,640
combined that's 77 of attacks come from

270
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,880
these two things that we've known have

271
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,279
been relatively low-hanging fruit for

272
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,880
quite some time right if we're doing

273
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,560
better user awareness if we're doing uh

274
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,200
turning off macros so that they don't

275
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,120
get through our email filters if we're

276
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
educating our users not to click on

277
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
links uh the email fish

278
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,480
vector goes down considerably right and

279
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,959
i know if you look at some of the tools

280
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,120
for doing user awareness like the hook

281
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,880
security and some of the new before

282
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,160
you're doing some really great videos

283
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,000
and helping with that i think that's

284
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,320
really important the next portion that

285
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,920
you'll see here and one that i see a

286
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,399
considerable amount of our

287
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,040
cases is exposed remote access having

288
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,519
rdp exposed on the internet so we'll

289
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,320
talk about that a little bit uh in

290
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,560
in a couple slides but uh expose remote

291
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,320
access if you've got rdp hanging out on

292
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,240
the internet we've got a problem right

293
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,079
um sometimes that comes from shadow i.t

294
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,000
or other things but we've got to clean

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,519
those things up so

296
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,320
we'll keep going

297
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,680
um a case overview so the case that

298
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,680
we'll talk about today the victim

299
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
organization was a north carolina-based

300
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,240
uh manufacturer so they've got 20 sites

301
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,079
across 10 states

302
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,040
their

303
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,240
original

304
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,640
demand was 25 bitcoin

305
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
they did pay the ransom and they

306
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,040
negotiated that down to 12.5 bitcoin

307
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,360
last i checked bitcoin was around 50

308
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,480
years so 50 000 or so dollars each uh so

309
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,320
that kind of you can give you an idea of

310
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,240
what they paid their downtime was about

311
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,640
12 days and the negotiation time was

312
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,320
about six days we'll talk about that in

313
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,079
a minute some folks think that you know

314
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,000
paying the ransom is easy button right

315
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you ran some of my stuff i paid you the

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
money you give me the key we keep going

317
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,720
um that's um

318
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,240
not how it typically works there are a

319
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,399
lot of other intricacies built into that

320
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,060
um and uh to um

321
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,959
[Music]

322
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,640
the point in the discord channel you're

323
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,079
absolutely correct cyber insurance is

324
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,720
looking at rdp as part of that uh there

325
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,240
are at some point there's gonna be you

326
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,000
gotta be this tall to get cyber

327
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,519
insurance right we're seeing folks get

328
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,800
turned away because they don't have

329
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
basic controls but in the place that's a

330
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,720
good point that you mentioned there and

331
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,120
the variant of ransomware here was

332
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
snatched so if you look at

333
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,519
the the right side of the screen this is

334
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,880
an actual screenshot of the ransom note

335
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,399
uh client um had a backup job fail over

336
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,880
a weekend admin logs in and sees this on

337
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,160
several devices throughout the

338
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,240
environment and then it's it's game on

339
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,399
at that point right so we're seeing most

340
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,959
of these threat actors use protonmail or

341
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,240
toot nota

342
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,880
for contact and they're giving a website

343
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,519
for you to go uh visit to to to log in

344
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,680
to get um

345
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,000
get to ransom start so

346
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,040
we'll keep moving here uh proactive tips

347
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,639
so think about the timing of attacks

348
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,399
when do we typically see these things

349
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,800
happen the larger attacks typically

350
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,920
happen around u.s holidays and it makes

351
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,680
sense right there's less folks working

352
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,760
at that time there's more time to be

353
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,600
able to do things because people are on

354
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,680
vacation and they make a bigger impact

355
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
when you do it if you see see the

356
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,440
pattern here most of us especially those

357
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,000
of us in the southeast were impacted by

358
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,680
the dark side attack on colonial

359
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,200
pipeline right so

360
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,959
mike mentioned in his talk earlier you

361
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,639
know no gas at several gas stations

362
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,000
things like that that happened around

363
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,639
mother's day the next one we saw was uh

364
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,880
jbs meat so

365
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,399
one of the largest meat processors in

366
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,320
the world was impacted around memorial

367
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,600
day of of this year uh we saw the casey

368
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,920
attack happen around july 4th that was

369
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,279
huge from an mssp perspective and what i

370
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,079
want you to think about is

371
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,320
who's next right we didn't see any large

372
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,920
attacks happen around labor day which

373
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,160
was great um and being an innocent

374
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,959
responder and i rarely get a holiday off

375
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,639
right so i had labor day off this year

376
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,399
which was really great i was really

377
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,639
happy for that but uh what i'm concerned

378
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,800
about is what happens next right who's

379
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,519
who's being set up um for an attack on

380
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,720
thanksgiving

381
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,399
typically attackers aren't within an

382
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,160
environment for weeks before they start

383
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
their encryption process they're going

384
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,199
through they're getting more

385
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,120
intelligence they're elevating their

386
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,720
privilege they're going and destroying

387
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,399
your backups by the way we'll talk about

388
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,199
that

389
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,959
but typically they're in the environment

390
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,360
for a few weeks before they do

391
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,440
before they perform an encryption so

392
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,519
what i want us to be able to do is go

393
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,360
back into our environments and increase

394
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,000
our security awareness training for our

395
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,920
folks let's do an extra fish test let's

396
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,399
send out uh some more mailers let's get

397
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,160
them thinking more about clicking on

398
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
links and things like that this is a

399
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,639
great month right so um

400
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,959
it's uh

401
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,120
a great month because it's uh cyber

402
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
security awareness month so i i've

403
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,880
spoken to several clients this month and

404
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,160
we're doing some more training for other

405
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,800
clients um not to scare people out of

406
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,720
getting getting out of ir as christian

407
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,519
mentions in the discord field but it it

408
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,120
is important for folks to understand

409
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,440
what we're seeing um outside now so this

410
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,040
is a good time for you to send out extra

411
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,079
mailers

412
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,480
do extra fish tests whatever it is that

413
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
you do inside your environment right

414
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
again i know hook security and know

415
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,680
before some others have a lot of

416
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,839
campaigns going on now it's really easy

417
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,000
to go in and click send those things out

418
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,320
and get raise more awareness for

419
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
security so really important time of

420
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,199
year and i think it's nice um and the

421
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,199
geek seek mentions yeah some weekly

422
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,120
quizzes prizes are great people love

423
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
prizes right where that's uh you know

424
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,880
amazon cards i see a lot of folks doing

425
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
amazon cards or are giving away some

426
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,959
type of points i've seen folks do

427
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,720
aggregate points where someone gets an

428
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,240
extra day off at the end of the month

429
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
after those things there's a lot of ways

430
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,600
to to

431
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,920
to build that uh trusting community

432
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,600
around securities but security is

433
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,360
everyone's job right so we want to make

434
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,680
sure that we empower the users

435
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,199
so that's really important we'll keep

436
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,880
moving

437
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,040
cyber insurance coverage you'll hear a

438
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
cyber insurance coverage i don't think

439
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,160
you can go to a conference without

440
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,120
talking about cyber insurance now um so

441
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,680
it it's there's a lot of sessions about

442
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,279
it and a lot of online things to think

443
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,959
about what i don't think a lot of

444
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,440
clients think about beforehand is what

445
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,000
their coverage uh pays for so this

446
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,040
particular

447
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,480
client

448
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,240
had an issue they had cyber insurance

449
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,519
they thought they were good until they

450
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,199
read and found out what it actually pays

451
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,759
for so their insurance would pay for a

452
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,759
half a million dollar ransom

453
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,440
that's that's a problem right we already

454
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,079
talked about the bitcoins were over

455
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,759
uh you know fifty thousand dollars and

456
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,839
they had 12.5 to pay so that's one gap

457
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,920
they had to pay out of also their

458
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,480
coverage did not pay for data recovery

459
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
it didn't pay for the negotiation it

460
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,160
didn't pay for anything else it only

461
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,560
paid for that ransom so yes they had

462
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
insurance coverage and they thought they

463
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
were in a good spot however they just

464
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,079
didn't realize what they didn't know so

465
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,000
what we're encouraging folks do is to

466
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,839
know what your coverage is

467
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,759
you don't want to be negotiating with

468
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,360
the fire department when your house is

469
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,800
on fire right you want to know these

470
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,519
things before time and that's what's

471
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,880
really important to know what you're

472
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,839
paying for to know what to expect um

473
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,920
again cyber insurance is important and

474
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,519
it's great to have but if you don't know

475
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,720
what you're paying for and you don't

476
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,399
know what's going to be covered it's

477
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,000
going to be very challenging for you to

478
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,560
come out on the other end a good spot so

479
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,920
proactive tip

480
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,560
go

481
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,720
look at your cyber insurance policy see

482
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,320
what you're paying for see what the

483
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,399
brokers are charging for you and make

484
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,720
sure that you're at appropriate level

485
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,680
for your risk appetite

486
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,839
perimeter exposure so we talked about

487
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,240
rdp being open on the internet that's 37

488
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,640
percent of ransomware cases uh this is

489
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,280
huge so uh colonial pipeline you guys

490
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,599
have all heard about it uh the reason

491
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,199
that started was from the legacy

492
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,199
infrastructure on the network perimeter

493
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,079
someone left a vpn concentrator without

494
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,319
multi-factor authentication turned on

495
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,079
the outside perimeter

496
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,760
they they were able to breach the

497
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,360
environment and come through

498
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
game over at that point right so we need

499
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,679
to make sure that we understand what is

500
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,520
exposed in our perimeter and it's really

501
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,960
easy for something like this to happen

502
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,160
right it's

503
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,559
maybe it's shadow i.t maybe it's

504
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,240
end of life devices that no one thought

505
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,919
about anymore there's all kind of things

506
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,600
that could be hanging out there we need

507
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,120
to understand

508
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,600
what it is so um

509
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
what i'm encouraging folks to do is to

510
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,960
have a regular cadence of proactive

511
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
scans and that can just be an map scan

512
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,160
right maybe you're

513
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,640
spitting up an nmap server and

514
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,559
you know scanning once a month and it's

515
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,080
important that we do it once a month or

516
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
at some regular cadence to look at the

517
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
deltas right it's one thing to go out

518
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,640
and say

519
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,520
oh let's just go and see um uh you know

520
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,919
what's open today and it's fine right

521
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,760
everything was fine in the beginning of

522
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,080
october we don't have to do this again

523
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,679
no what we need to do is make sure that

524
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,799
we understand what opens over that time

525
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,640
right so there's all kind of things that

526
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,480
could happen in title environment and i

527
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,600
know

528
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,360
shane is very familiar with large

529
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,760
environments and he's posting uh

530
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
some stuff in the discord there but yeah

531
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,080
it happens all the time right there's

532
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
it's really difficult for any uh one

533
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
body to know everything all the moving

534
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,880
parts within a network so if we're doing

535
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,760
regular scheduled

536
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,240
scans with our regular cadence it lets

537
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,559
us understand so i looked at it on the

538
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,240
beginning of september and i looked at

539
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,160
it again on october what changed right

540
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,760
why is 33.89 open now why is smb open

541
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,120
now right so

542
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,679
and icon recommends uh using rumble for

543
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,679
uh external scan it's that's a great uh

544
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,520
suggestion there icon i think thanks for

545
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,960
posting it but

546
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,520
let's make sure that we're watching

547
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
our external exposure right

548
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,679
the only way we're going to

549
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,280
get better at this is if we understand

550
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,360
our risk and our exposure so we'll keep

551
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,039
moving here

552
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,880
multi-factor all the things this is a

553
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,960
huge pet peeve of mine

554
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,440
real time authentication and biometrics

555
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,360
should be integrated to all of the

556
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,720
things

557
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,120
passwords are dead they are a cake we

558
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,799
should get rid of them

559
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,240
i don't care what you have to do you got

560
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
to be this tall to get on the ride but

561
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,600
if you're not doing multi-factor some

562
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,840
type of real-time authentication

563
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,679
you're not doing it right if you're not

564
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,320
road mapping a future where folks don't

565
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,960
have to remember 12 or 25 character

566
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,720
passwords and they can actually work

567
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,320
through something that's biometric maybe

568
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,640
it's a push something else

569
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,559
then then we're not doing it right so

570
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,559
you've got to keep doing those type of

571
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,679
things

572
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,720
because it's important a multi-factor

573
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,480
wasn't enabled in this client

574
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,799
environment they had were rolling it out

575
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,400
but didn't have it fully

576
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
operationalized when this attack

577
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,720
happened you can imagine how much more

578
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,880
quick how much quicker the rolled out

579
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,840
happened once they became encrypted with

580
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,280
ransomware so

581
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,039
i think this is hugely important we

582
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,159
cannot continue to expect our users to

583
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,480
come up with new 12 character passwords

584
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
every 30 days right based on whatever

585
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,360
cycle that we're using we can't continue

586
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,799
to expect our coders to not hard code

587
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,120
passwords into their

588
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,760
scripts right we cannot continue to do

589
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,280
that so there are plenty of tools out

590
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,200
that allow you to to get around that

591
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,799
right you can use

592
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,799
cyberark as a secrets tool you can do

593
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,080
all kinds of different things right

594
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,720
octa's got their multi-factor but we

595
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,039
need to be envisioning a past wordless

596
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,000
future um i say

597
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,840
everything that has administrative

598
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,039
privilege right now should have

599
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,840
multi-factor on it today right that's a

600
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,159
thing for you to do in the next quarter

601
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,919
make sure anything that's administrative

602
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,320
uh has multi-factor turned on so you're

603
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,480
going to administer an azure blob you've

604
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,320
got to have multi-factor you're going in

605
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,880
to add new folks in o365 you've got to

606
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,280
have multi-factor heck i think every

607
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
email account in o365 should have

608
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
multi-factor so i can preach about

609
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,360
passwords all day long but passwords are

610
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,439
dead let's bury them and move on

611
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,000
uh backup and restoration this is

612
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,919
critical right so they always say

613
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,080
amateurs back up and professionals or

614
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,400
store if you don't have a restoration

615
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,640
process built into your backup program

616
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
then you're only doing half your job and

617
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,679
i would say even less than that so

618
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,799
this is a critical aspect folks they're

619
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,640
using versioning software maybe it's

620
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
deserto maybe some of the others where

621
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
you can roll back to three days before

622
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,799
right but what about the account that

623
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,799
deserto is using right has that password

624
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,960
ever been changed is it integrated with

625
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,840
active directory if so then i've got

626
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,520
access to your backups at that point

627
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,840
right if i'm an attacker i can go in and

628
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,200
destroy them so uh most of the attacks

629
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,679
that we're seeing now uh backups are

630
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,679
being encrypted from the jump they're

631
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,360
coming into your environment before you

632
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,039
even know and they're encrypting all of

633
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,559
your backups and that's the case with

634
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,240
this client they used veeam as their

635
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,960
backup tool uh the veeam backup account

636
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,320
was compromised they went through and

637
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,080
encrypted all the backup before they

638
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,760
were even noticed before we even knew

639
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,600
they were in the 10 house they had

640
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,559
already

641
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,320
encrypted all of the

642
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,400
backups so we're seeing that more and

643
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,520
more i would say over 50 percent of the

644
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
cases that we're working now they're

645
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,200
going after the backups first so one

646
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
thing that we can do we tell folks is to

647
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,360
consider air gapping our backups uh that

648
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,799
means they're

649
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,480
someplace off the network right maybe

650
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,280
it's a tape room somewhere maybe it's uh

651
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,440
i don't know maybe it's uh synology that

652
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,360
you plug in when you do a backup and and

653
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,880
unplug it right take it back off the

654
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,280
network i don't care where it is but if

655
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,360
it's got 445 uh connected to it smb then

656
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,039
it's game over right these folks are

657
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,880
going to get there and they're going to

658
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
encrypt your backup so let's get them

659
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
off the network let's protect them so

660
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,799
that if we do have to rebuild we could

661
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,280
do that from a good start so

662
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,720
the next point that you see there on

663
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
proactive tip is restoration procedure

664
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,360
procedure should be timed and tweaked

665
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,960
what does that mean right what is your

666
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,120
risk tolerance how long can you be down

667
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,600
to restore from a backup

668
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,840
what impedes you from being quicker at

669
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,000
that right if you're not going through

670
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
and taking a backup and restoring it and

671
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,080
timing how long did it how long does

672
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,400
this take how critical is this to my

673
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,679
business

674
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,280
then what are you doing right yes you

675
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,720
have a backup and yes you can cut back

676
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,039
from it but if you're you're down for

677
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,640
two weeks are you out of business at

678
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,960
that point a lot a lot of small million

679
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,120
businesses would be so we've got to get

680
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,000
quicker that we've got to remove any uh

681
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,120
barriers moving into that so um one

682
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,720
thing to think about from a different

683
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,279
client they had an air gap backup great

684
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,600
it was on tapes perfect how long did it

685
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,080
take to come back a four terabyte server

686
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,600
to come back from tape took 72 hours

687
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,559
that's 72 hours that they weren't able

688
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,279
to rebuild right all file servers were

689
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,720
we're coming back on that for four

690
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,440
terabytes so keep these rebuild things

691
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,360
in mind um and make sure that we're

692
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,000
communicating up to our leadership hey

693
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,159
if we had a problem it's going to take

694
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,080
us this long to come back you want me to

695
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,720
shorten that no problem mr leader

696
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,679
we're going to have to have some more

697
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,720
budget we're going to have to do some

698
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,360
additional things cool and you guys have

699
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,120
some really good points in the chat

700
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,039
there that's really great

701
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,320
um

702
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,240
understanding the ransom process this is

703
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,279
another important slide um

704
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,000
paying the ransom is not an easy button

705
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,520
keep that in mind uh we at fortless have

706
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,640
we we make the stands that we do not uh

707
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,440
suggest that anyone pay the ransom ever

708
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,240
we don't believe it's um it behooves you

709
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,039
to pay the ransom it funnels money into

710
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,559
other criminal activities there's a lot

711
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,600
of things

712
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,000
that happen when you pay that ransom

713
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,159
however at some point it becomes a

714
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,760
business decision and we understand that

715
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,159
you have to understand that either this

716
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,039
client

717
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,039
pays a ransom and several hundred

718
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,720
thousand dollars or they completely go

719
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
out of business it becomes a different

720
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,520
uh conversation at that point right so

721
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,360
when a client has decides they want to

722
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,960
pay the ransom we give them the pros and

723
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,880
cons what that means if they decide to

724
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,039
pay the rents and what we do is act as a

725
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,440
go-between between them and their ransom

726
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,760
negotiators right so we're partners with

727
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
kivu

728
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,679
we work really closely with them some of

729
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,159
the other ransom negotiators as well

730
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,039
what that looks like is we actually

731
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,200
um kind of insulate the client at that

732
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,799
point right so client knows what we're

733
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,720
doing and we're not charging extra money

734
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
on top of this but we're insulating them

735
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,120
and advising them on how to move forward

736
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,440
um so it's important to understand the

737
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,120
ransom process it's not like you're

738
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,159
going to go get a bitcoin wallet down at

739
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,000
local bank of america put a hundred

740
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,360
thousand dollars in it and go buy a

741
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,640
couple bitcoins and you're going to be

742
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,480
working tomorrow afternoon that's not it

743
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,880
at all negotiations often take several

744
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,159
days

745
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,039
and you want to negotiate simply because

746
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,320
it's typically

747
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,200
40 to 50 reduction in the ask if you do

748
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,919
negotiating so that's important

749
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,520
um

750
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,440
the oftentimes the attackers are not in

751
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,360
the same time zone as we are they're

752
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,440
often on eastern european time so those

753
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
negotiations can take several days back

754
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,720
and forth uh so keep that uh my in mind

755
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,520
the time to recover uh is a good bit to

756
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,840
come come back and forth so between the

757
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,919
two um

758
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,400
often these decryption tools are awfully

759
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,799
poorly written so we've seen decryption

760
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,360
tool come in and if it's on a

761
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,520
you know 10 megs of word documents it

762
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,000
works fine if you have to decrypt an

763
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,919
entire virtual machine and it's 500 gigs

764
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,720
yeah they very rarely um

765
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,880
decrypt those in any decent amount of

766
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,440
time and oftentimes they end up

767
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,640
destroying the file right so first off

768
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,039
make backups before you try to decrypt

769
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,640
and try to decrypt the backups before

770
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,400
you do that that's the first thing the

771
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,320
next thing is sometimes you got to take

772
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
that key and write your own better

773
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,480
decryption tool and the third thing is

774
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,559
sometimes you've got to give extra

775
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,080
resources to the the v center um to be

776
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,039
able to encrypt the the file so

777
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,320
we can talk about that hopefully you

778
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,919
never get into that situation but these

779
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,679
are things to keep in mind

780
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,520
the next thing to know is attackers know

781
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,480
your pain point they are not going to

782
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,320
target for example and asking for ten

783
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,840
thousand dollars what two thousand

784
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,279
dollars is nothing to target right

785
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,880
they're also not going to a mom and pop

786
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,039
shop and asking for four billion dollars

787
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
it just doesn't make sense typically

788
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
what we're seeing attackers are looking

789
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,480
online sometimes they're looking in the

790
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,799
data they stole from you uh sometimes

791
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,919
they're looking at other online um ocean

792
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,240
information and they're taking about 10

793
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,559
percent of what your your gross profit

794
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,919
is for a year and that's what they're

795
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,080
asking for in ransom so

796
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,679
they understand

797
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,440
about what you can pay and they

798
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,760
understand what makes it uh palatable

799
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,039
for you

800
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,120
um a new trend that we want to talk

801
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,480
about is a lot of the

802
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,200
ransomware attackers now have decided

803
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,399
they're not going to work with a

804
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,760
negotiator

805
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,799
they're putting in their ransom note

806
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,159
if you try to

807
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,640
contact some of these negotiators uh we

808
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
will automatically uh delete your

809
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,159
decryption key

810
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,559
um so that's important right so they uh

811
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,159
for whatever reason they decided they're

812
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,399
not dealing with negotiators anymore

813
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,840
they're that's a middle person they

814
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,679
don't want to deal with them

815
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,279
we've seen a significant uptick in that

816
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,559
over the past

817
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,640
probably three or four weeks

818
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,000
when threat actors are coming in and

819
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,039
saying we're not going to deal with

820
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,600
negotiators anymore so keep that in mind

821
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,279
and the last point that you see there

822
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,960
this a lot of information on the slide

823
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,039
there is no guarantee there's no

824
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,120
guarantee if you pay that money that

825
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,360
you'll get the decryption key there is

826
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,679
however uh what i like to call honor

827
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,000
among thieves so when you start dealing

828
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,600
with the negotiator

829
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,000
you can start to see what the trends are

830
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,679
right so if you deal with a negotiator

831
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,360
like your keyboard or some of the other

832
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,240
ones

833
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,720
they will give you a report back saying

834
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,120
yes we've dealt with conti for example

835
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,919
and our success rate is 92 but we

836
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,360
usually get

837
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,720
the the

838
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,880
decryption tool and this amount of days

839
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,080
things like that so you do get some type

840
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,000
of assurance but there is no guarantee

841
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,919
that if you pay the ransom that you'll

842
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,200
get your keys so keep that in mind

843
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,279
what i would say is for a proactive tip

844
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,360
here is to consider opening a bitcoin

845
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,840
wallet now um maybe that's someone in

846
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,360
your financial um services uh arm of

847
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,919
your company have a bitcoin wallet ready

848
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,360
maybe you only you know put a few

849
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,240
dollars in it but have it be able to to

850
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,480
access it and be able to go add bitcoin

851
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,159
in case you need it again we want you to

852
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,640
be prepared if you were to come up on a

853
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,480
ransomware situation

854
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,399
i love the chapman you guys are hitting

855
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,399
on some really great points there

856
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,240
network segmentation so as we talked

857
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,720
about segmentation uh this particular

858
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,600
client is as mentioned a manufacturer

859
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,919
their uh network had grown organically

860
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,679
over several years they were based in

861
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,919
about 10 different states so that

862
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:22,960
happened through mergers and

863
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,200
acquisitions do that sound familiar

864
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,600
there's a lot of people who are growing

865
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,840
through m a right and you don't know

866
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,600
what the other sites often have and

867
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,000
oftentimes you just open everything over

868
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
the mpls between the two different sites

869
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,600
and and that makes it incredibly

870
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,760
difficult to be able to contain

871
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,919
an infection if we had it so

872
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,679
these attackers came in through the main

873
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,440
data center there was no segmentation

874
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,279
between the main data center and the

875
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,080
other uh 20 or so sites and then they

876
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,600
were able to move out over s b 445 uh

877
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,840
and encrypt the entire environment

878
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,799
so we want to have and be road mapping a

879
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,519
zero trust micro segmented network and

880
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,880
if

881
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,080
you

882
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,159
are doing anything in cyber security

883
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,679
you're hearing everyone talking about

884
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,679
xero trust right it's the new buzzword

885
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,320
it's if machine learning and ai was a

886
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,159
buzzword for the past five years zero

887
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,159
trust is a new buzzword and what we're

888
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,640
talking about when we say xero trust is

889
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,799
a need to know specifically right is

890
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,399
there any reason for the ipad that's on

891
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,320
the ceo's

892
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,200
desk should it ever touch the ot devices

893
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,640
in the production

894
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,960
you know manufacture facility probably

895
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,200
not right there's really no reason for

896
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,039
us to have open networks across the

897
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,880
entire environment it makes it really

898
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,799
difficult to protect and it makes it

899
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,279
incredibly difficult to contain uh

900
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,519
oftentimes we go in

901
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,960
in the middle of an incident and talk to

902
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,480
clients they don't have any segmentation

903
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
at all so what we have them do is build

904
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,720
up a clean network so we can put in

905
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,600
triage devices or rebuilt devices and

906
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,200
then build the network out from there

907
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,080
with some segmentation built in so the

908
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,440
proactive tip

909
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,399
be road mapping a zero truss micro

910
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,559
segmented network for only devices that

911
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,240
need to talk to each other are allowed

912
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,399
to do that

913
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,440
um

914
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,120
let's keep moving here um engaging uh

915
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,960
law enforcement um this is a bit of a

916
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,799
touchy subject uh

917
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,840
for several reasons but um

918
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,080
you don't have to in the united states

919
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,480
you don't or you're not required

920
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,039
currently to report a ransomware

921
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,559
incident whether you're in the middle of

922
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,559
an incident where you paid the ransom

923
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,320
you're not required to report those

924
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,480
things currently and i say currently

925
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,240
because just a couple days ago there was

926
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,399
some legislation

927
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,320
that's beginning to form on the hill

928
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,760
where

929
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,919
you'll have 48 hours after you pay a

930
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,799
ransom to be able to come in

931
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,399
and report up

932
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,320
what you paid what the

933
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,640
particular specifics of your incident

934
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,000
are

935
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,880
now having said that we encourage folks

936
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,000
to engage with the fbi and department of

937
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,919
justice and we can be their go between

938
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,279
for them and there's two different ways

939
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,360
you can do that and i'll tell you the

940
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,120
distinction between the two

941
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,279
one is you can do that anonymously so we

942
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,640
have um

943
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,279
relationships with the fbi and doj

944
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,640
we can

945
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,320
broker the connectivity for you there

946
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,120
so

947
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,880
if you want to do it anonymously what we

948
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,799
can do is give them information about

949
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,159
your case right maybe we tell the

950
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,159
vertical urine we tell them the variant

951
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,000
that we're dealing with what they can do

952
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,679
is provide back some indicators of

953
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,600
compromise and some threat intel that

954
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,320
they have so they have a world of

955
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,880
information about iocs oftentimes it's

956
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,480
things that haven't been

957
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,440
um

958
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,320
leaked out or others that don't know so

959
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,039
when we engage them on your behalf

960
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,039
it's really great for us to get that

961
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,120
intel back

962
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,039
it's really awesome uh some of the

963
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,640
things that we've read there it's things

964
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,880
that you don't see in normal reports so

965
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,960
i always encourage folks to do that um

966
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,320
the second way to do this is actual uh

967
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,880
transparency right so i can go to the

968
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,480
fbi and say hey i've got a client

969
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,760
they're based in greenville south

970
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,000
carolina here's their name here's what

971
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,599
we're dealing with here's how long

972
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,918
they've been down things like that

973
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,918
this gives them even more information

974
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,520
and i'll tell you why that's important

975
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,760
for the next person who gets encrypted

976
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,359
right if they have the information from

977
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:25,599
this new um

978
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,879
company right this new ransomware um

979
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,480
attack they can add that to their

980
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,399
database and then we can build a better

981
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,480
picture of what our threat actors are

982
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,199
are doing so i always encourage folks to

983
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,199
talk to fbi and i've had some clients

984
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,119
say i don't want anybody knowing about

985
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,199
this right and that typically comes from

986
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,119
council either internal or external but

987
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,359
they'll say no we don't want to engage

988
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,760
fbi or doj and that's fine if they don't

989
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,520
want to that it's okay

990
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,280
but we always encourage folks to do that

991
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,480
just because it gives the fbi a better

992
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
idea of how to deal with this for the

993
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,760
next

994
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,119
attack

995
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,119
one thing also to think about here no

996
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,440
matter where you're based

997
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,440
a different office may be handling the

998
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,760
case right so conti for example instead

999
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,640
of having each fbi office uh having

1000
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
someone dealing with conti ransomware

1001
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,240
all those are handled out of the dallas

1002
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,640
office right or maybe you're uh dealing

1003
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,880
with snatch um so

1004
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,400
that may be based out of the charlotte

1005
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,720
office or something else so uh

1006
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,200
wherever you report into maybe locally

1007
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,520
you may get sent off to one of the other

1008
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,960
offices so

1009
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,119
i appreciate the kind words in the uh

1010
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,280
chat there this is good information i

1011
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,880
hope you guys are getting

1012
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,480
getting something out of it so the

1013
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,320
proactive tip here is consider what

1014
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
criteria should be weighed when engaging

1015
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,200
law enforcement right so think about uh

1016
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,839
make sure your council understands the

1017
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:50,079
difference between doing it um

1018
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,800
anonymously or transparency if it's x

1019
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,400
number of data that has left the

1020
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,160
environment is that when we call in the

1021
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,800
fbi is it x number of ransom if it's

1022
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,520
over five bitcoin we engage other things

1023
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,440
to think about and what we're trying to

1024
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,839
do here is be proactive right we're

1025
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,000
trying to to understand and think

1026
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,839
through these things before we're in the

1027
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,520
middle of an attack

1028
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,200
once you get into the middle of attack

1029
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,880
all these things start speeding up and

1030
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,599
moving more quickly if we have a plan

1031
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,880
it's really much easier

1032
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,960
to work through and and to execute on

1033
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,400
the plan we don't have to think through

1034
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,640
the things at that point we just execute

1035
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,160
that's what we're trying to get to we'll

1036
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,000
keep going

1037
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
out of band communications this one's

1038
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,320
big it's another takeaway take a

1039
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,680
screenshot

1040
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,839
go to your

1041
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,280
leadership tomorrow i don't know what

1042
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,520
you have to do but folks don't think

1043
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,000
about having out-of-band communication

1044
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,240
what happens when our collaboration and

1045
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,480
our email tools are compromised or we

1046
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,240
think there may be compromise

1047
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,000
this attack originally started as a

1048
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,480
business email compromise we had

1049
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,200
indication that they were still inside

1050
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,680
the email system so we had to quickly

1051
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,520
establish out-of-band communications

1052
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,920
right so it looks like maybe it's proton

1053
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
mail maybe it's gmail i don't know what

1054
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,839
it is but make sure you have a plan for

1055
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,839
out of bad communications we have to

1056
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,000
have a way to work through the incident

1057
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and to share information back and forth

1058
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,640
in a secure manner there are many times

1059
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,000
where we have to

1060
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,560
get the entire environment's encrypted

1061
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,400
how are we going to use sharepoint right

1062
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,520
how are we going to use some of these

1063
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
other tools a lot of folks aren't

1064
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
thinking about what happens if the

1065
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,920
entire environment is down or we have an

1066
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,720
issue

1067
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,560
it's just a really big problem that i

1068
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,000
don't think a lot of folks are thinking

1069
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,800
through

1070
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,599
how do they how do they talk if they're

1071
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,000
in the middle of a compromise so

1072
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,560
um the pro tip is established about a

1073
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,960
bad communication collaboration strategy

1074
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,400
maybe that looks like you going and

1075
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,720
registering five proton mail accounts on

1076
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,640
monday and you keep the password and the

1077
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,960
password manager and if the world's on

1078
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,880
fire you know you've got five accounts

1079
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,640
you can dole out to different votes and

1080
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,280
you all can collaborate on protonmail

1081
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,640
right so these are things to keep it

1082
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,320
keep in mind

1083
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,920
we're getting to the end guys and i'm

1084
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,079
really uh happy you guys are staying

1085
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,520
with me so we're getting pretty close

1086
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,839
here so uh we talked a little bit about

1087
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,079
name and shame um again most of the

1088
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,320
attacks that we're dealing with now are

1089
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,000
threatening to release stolen data on

1090
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,359
the dark web

1091
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,280
it's rare for us to see a case that it

1092
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,119
doesn't happen anymore

1093
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,520
um attackers they're going to release

1094
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
data right so that's and the reason they

1095
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,240
do that is to compel you to pay um

1096
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,520
and and

1097
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,960
what is a compelling reason though

1098
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,680
typically it's reputational damage so

1099
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,599
maybe you had good backups right maybe

1100
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,119
you could bring them back up and you

1101
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,480
don't necessarily care about it but what

1102
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,800
happens if all your contracts are leaked

1103
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,480
on the internet right what happens if

1104
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,960
all of your clients data is leaked out

1105
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,960
on the dark web these are some of the

1106
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,359
things challenges that they're that that

1107
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,520
um that we're having to deal with and we

1108
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,880
have to decide

1109
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,040
yes i could bring my environment back up

1110
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,599
with backups but is it worth paying for

1111
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,079
bitcoin so that all of my clients data

1112
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,560
doesn't get sprayed out there these are

1113
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,079
things that we have to work out and you

1114
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,000
have to work through in real time right

1115
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
so um you have to be prepared for that

1116
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,480
have a strategy again we're trying to do

1117
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,400
proactive things so we can just execute

1118
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,960
in the middle of an attack uh the bottom

1119
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,119
bullet point that you see there we are

1120
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,680
seeing attackers contacting leadership

1121
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,040
so they're looking through linkedin or

1122
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,599
they're looking through uh or trees that

1123
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,200
they've stolen from your environment

1124
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,280
they're finding out who the coo is who

1125
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,920
the ceo is who the financial folks are

1126
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,760
who the legal team are and they're

1127
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,960
contacting them saying that they have

1128
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,599
the data is out for sale on the dark web

1129
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,920
and your i.t team is considering not

1130
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,520
paying right so they're contacting

1131
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,960
leadership so you've got to make sure

1132
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,599
that you're telling your leadership that

1133
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,440
yes you may be contacted here the things

1134
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,680
to say or not say

1135
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,400
yes mr ceo i understand it's going to be

1136
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,480
scary if you have a thick russian accent

1137
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,240
person on the other end of the line

1138
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,400
saying that they have all of your data

1139
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,000
that actually happened i talked to a

1140
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,359
client on wednesday their co was called

1141
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,079
by a thick russian accent we've got all

1142
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,839
your data you guys have to pay the

1143
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,200
ransom so

1144
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,560
that will spook

1145
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,800
any ceo right so let's make sure we're

1146
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,400
communicating with them you don't want

1147
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,480
that to hit them in a blind spot and

1148
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,000
then they end up leaking some

1149
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,040
information

1150
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,280
um that that could be critical to the to

1151
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,520
the incident response so

1152
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,000
the proactive tip that you see here

1153
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,079
an advanced data map these are basic

1154
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,680
things right we have to have a data

1155
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,000
classification methodology we have to

1156
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,920
have those things because how do we know

1157
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,720
what value the data they took is if i

1158
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,800
can go through logs and see that someone

1159
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,960
was in the environment for three weeks

1160
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,720
and they took out you know two gigs of

1161
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,920
data but they only got access to um you

1162
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,640
know public powerpoint slides

1163
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,160
am i going to be compelled to pay at

1164
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,319
that point probably not but if we don't

1165
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,240
have a data map and we don't have a data

1166
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,880
classification methodology it's really

1167
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,839
difficult to be able to do that so um

1168
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,599
it's really a challenge i think we need

1169
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,280
to have data maps i don't think we talk

1170
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,240
about that enough it's not sexy like

1171
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,160
response or pen testing or anything like

1172
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,040
that

1173
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,560
but having a data map understanding

1174
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,920
where our data is is really critical

1175
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,680
all right

1176
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,680
oh that's it so i came in at 10 45 i'm

1177
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,760
getting us close to being back on track

1178
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,200
um

1179
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,880
what proactive tips did you hear that

1180
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,200
you disagree with this is where you guys

1181
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,240
throw tomatoes uh have some questions

1182
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,599
is there any topics that need more

1183
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,040
context to be

1184
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,839
actionable uh and as ryan posted we'll

1185
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,079
have an attorney on later um to talk

1186
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,599
about data maps i think that's that's

1187
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,599
critical um

1188
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,960
are there any proactive tips that you

1189
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,720
guys heard that you think you want to

1190
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,960

actually posted a question what's the uh

1233
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,839
longest wall time you've come across in

1234
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:28,240
your adventures and incident responses

1235
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,440
so longest time that i've seen and the

1236
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,520
logs only went back for 12 months and

1237
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,520
they were there for every

1238
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,640
log that they had so uh yeah it's it's a

1239
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,839
challenge for sure
