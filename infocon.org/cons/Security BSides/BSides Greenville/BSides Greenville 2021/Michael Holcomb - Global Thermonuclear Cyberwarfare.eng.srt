1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,040
so i appreciate for everybody for

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,599
hanging out for the talk um for those of

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,120
you that don't know me my name is mike

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,759
mike holcomb uh i am a director of

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,839
information security and fellow of cyber

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,600
security at floor

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,039
we're one of the world's largest

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,960
construction and engineering companies

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,600
so i actually get to interface with a

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,840
lot of industrial control

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,400
engineers a lot of top

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,880
industrial control engineers uh some of

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,640
the projects that i've been working on

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,200
uh lately and i'm not giving away any

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,920
top secrets here but um you know shell

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,800
is is the by far the the largest client

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,520
that i've worked directly with uh and we

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
have two of their their largest projects

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
in the world that we're working with

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,160
them on uh one is for a new lng plant a

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,640
liquid natural gas plant up in

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,280
the far reaches of canada so if you're

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,440
familiar with like gold rush the tv show

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,920
or ice road truckers kind of think way

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,680
way up there

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,280
so that's that's one of the projects

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,040
that i get to work with so it's really

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,200
exciting uh and then also working with

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
them on the um

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
on an offshore oil rig

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
which is a but it's a kind of a

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,840
different setup

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
so it's interesting and fun as well and

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,759
a few other things that we'll talk about

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,080
throughout the the presentation i do

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
have some certifications out there

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,159
the big two i listed for this

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,759
presentation which apparently one i

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,600
can't spell correctly

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,479
so are the i have two of the the three

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,040
sans industrial control related uh

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,560
certifications which is going to come

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,400
into play during this conversation

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,560
because rob lee who actually founded

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,880
draco's as well as the he also founded

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,479
the nsa group

47
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,040
that hunts and finds

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,119
other nation states attacking control

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,119
system environments

50
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,759
he actually wrote and topped the grid

51
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,079
class that i had attended which was the

52
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,960
best class that that i've ever taken uh

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,079
primarily because of rob and and uh

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,159
all the information that he shared so he

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,840
did a phenomenal job i can't can't uh

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
recommend it enough if if you are

57
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,038
interested in industrial controls and

58
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,440
and cyber security and and more from

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
that response piece so so a lot of

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,080
things that we'll talk about is as we go

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,360
on but

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,480
and so here's what we're going to be

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,720
talking about so everything from we talk

64
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
about well no one likes ics security and

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,480
we'll get into that but for me you know

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,120
i i remember and the name of the

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,840
presentation uh i

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,519
had looked it up and and somebody had

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,319
used the name for a ctf machine for for

70
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,840
actually uh

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
another event which i thought was was

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,239
pretty interesting but uh you know for

73
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,239
me i think like some people that get

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,040
into cyber security it's a tv show or

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,879
it's a movie or maybe it's a book like

76
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,720
cuckoo's egg or sandworm which we're

77
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,879
gonna talk about today uh for me it was

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,599
war games i was probably i think eight

79
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,680
um it was it was funny because

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,560
wargrain's war games wasn't a really you

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,800
know hugely popular movie i do remember

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,920
seeing it in the movie theater uh where

83
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,840
you know you got matthew broderick right

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
he brings a pretty girl home from from

85
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,560
school and and he's he's uh

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,519
he's

87
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,920
dialing into systems and trying to break

88
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
in and remember he was you know changing

89
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,560
grades for for everybody at school and

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,840
and i just thought

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,680
that was the the coolest thing and at

92
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
that point i was hooked um

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
again it wasn't probably the most

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,840
popular movie because um

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,799
the uh empire strikes back actually was

96
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,360
released the following week so so nobody

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,599
was really interested probably in war

98
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,959
games uh at that point right but

99
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,040
um but that was the one for you know

100
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,760
that that really got me interested in in

101
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,720
in cyber security and i always always

102
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,480
remember that so

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,360
um

104
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,760
i do jokingly say that no one likes

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,840
industrial control security or sometimes

106
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,760
i'll just say control systems because

107
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,400
that's how we refer to it

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,640
at uh at floor

109
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,959
uh but we talk about it well almost no

110
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,159
one and

111
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,680
where this came from was when we did a

112
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,840
survey of

113
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,440
of all of the isa um

114
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,160
members so there's about 500 folks that

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,880
are active on the the mailing list that

116
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,680
we surveyed and asked you know when if

117
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,800
you want

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,479
to attend some

119
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,520
uh

120
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,400
training

121
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,479
that what

122
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,479
subject would you know are you the most

123
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,160
interested in

124
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,240
and so you can see so so active threat

125
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,880
hunting came came up uh incident

126
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
response and penetration testing you can

127
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,639
see all tied for for that top top slot

128
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,120
and we also talk about cloud security

129
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,199
and bug bounty

130
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,400
so all all really interesting topics in

131
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,960
in the field uh and then we started

132
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,320
going through

133
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,240
the list and this so this is the entire

134
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,880
list that we were asking everybody um

135
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,800
about and that you can see

136
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,199
and i should say well it's not at the

137
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,479
very bottom

138
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,600
but it's

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,720
near

140
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,840
the bottom

141
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,039
so where we uh

142
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,160
you know just

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,680
checking discord real quick all of a

144
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,160
sudden so it's also this big pop up in

145
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,479
the corner of my eye but you can see

146
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,280
that industrial control system security

147
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,080
was fourth from the bottom so i i'm sad

148
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,240
to see mitre attack isn't as high as it

149
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,080
should be i guess no one's worried about

150
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,600
security plus

151
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,280
and and risk management which really

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
should be at the top of everybody's list

153
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,960
but that's a whole other conversation as

154
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,400
well right so not everyone

155
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
is interested in industrial control

156
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,639
security but it's one of those to me

157
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,120
that everybody should be interested in

158
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,600
industrial controlled security but at

159
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,319
the same time i always talk to people in

160
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,319
in general i.t and i work with a lot of

161
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,960
students like at greenville tech and and

162
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
and about and talking and working with

163
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,199
them in cyber security and and how some

164
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,960
of the i.t students could care less

165
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,360
about cyber security right and i i can't

166
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
understand that but so i understand

167
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
industrial control security is not for

168
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,479
everybody

169
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,720
but part of the idea behind this

170
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,360
presentation and then the uh the free

171
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,919
course that i'm doing starting off in in

172
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,120
december is really you know why it

173
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,919
matters to to all of us especially cyber

174
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,080
security professionals and maybe you

175
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,039
don't work in an industrial control uh

176
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,440
environment that's okay it's still

177
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,080
important to understand those basics the

178
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,880
nice thing is that for experienced cyber

179
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
security professionals

180
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,960
you have to remember that control system

181
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
engineers they don't have that cyber

182
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,560
security knowledge that we traditionally

183
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,520
have so we can bring that knowledge to

184
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,039
them and help them secure the

185
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,520
environments so when we talk about

186
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,280
securing those power plants or those

187
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,680
water treatment facilities

188
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,280
we have the ability to help them secure

189
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,599
those networks i actually was talking

190
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,599
with one of our engineers i had that i

191
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,840
had never met before a gentleman in in

192
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
india yesterday and he was talking about

193
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,080
how interested he is in security and

194
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,599
then he um for his home he had actually

195
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,160
created essentially a little iot but you

196
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,319
could say an industrial control system

197
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,319
setup where he had taken a raspberry pi

198
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,479
and spun up a little web server on it

199
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,880
put a little coat on there in python

200
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,400
and used it to control a solenoid in his

201
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,360
garden so when he was away when his wife

202
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,520
you know he went on vacation they could

203
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,840
remotely control the the solenoid to

204
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,039
turn on essentially turn on the

205
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,720
sprinklers in the garden

206
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,879
right and and he thought that that was

207
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,479
really uh that was great and i thought

208
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,879
yeah that's really interesting and then

209
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,720
i was you know asking well how do you

210
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,240
control it he's like oh well it's just a

211
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,080
little web page that's connected to the

212
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,599
internet and i can access it from my

213
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,120
cell phone

214
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,919
we're like can anybody on the internet

215
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,639
access it from from anywhere and he's

216
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,160
like uh probably

217
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,199
and so

218
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,360
there's definitely that a lot of control

219
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,199
system engineers

220
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,360
aren't thinking about cyber security

221
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,120
right it's just never been their focus a

222
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,199
lot of like a lot of conversations we

223
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,960
have around developers right most

224
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,800
developers still today and no offense to

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,360
any developers we have in the crowd but

226
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,160
most developers still don't see cyber

227
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,639
security as part of their roles and

228
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,399
responsibility right it's all about

229
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,479
getting that application writing that

230
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,320
code getting it out and getting it from

231
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,679
production

232
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,120
where we're kind of still trying to come

233
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,039
back and say and that's great right and

234
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,640
that's what you're here for but we also

235
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,360
need to make sure we do this securely

236
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,640
and that's the same thing with

237
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,560
industrial controls

238
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,640
now i'm very lucky in my job because i

239
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,480
get to work in brand new environment so

240
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
it's easy to say yeah let's build in

241
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
security from the very beginning

242
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,120
versus if we go into like a

243
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,279
petrochemical facility that's existed

244
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,240
for 30 years there's a big difference

245
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,120
and i'm jumping ahead a little bit but

246
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
so sand worm and hopefully there's some

247
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,480
avid readers out there um so sandworm's

248
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,959
a book written by andy greenberg andy

249
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
greenberg is the writer for wired

250
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,839
magazine so anytime there's a story

251
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,600
related to cyber security especially if

252
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,399
industrial control systems is involved

253
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,240
then andy is the the person that

254
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,320
is writing those articles

255
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
and sandworm came out and uh talked

256
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,600
about this story about this hamburg

257
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,360
attack group which is

258
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,440
uh not giving anything away at this

259
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,640
point right is is a russian nation-state

260
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,440
uh sponsored advanced persistent threat

261
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,120
group targeting

262
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,360
control systems environments and they do

263
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
some other work as well right um

264
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,760
but

265
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,839
the whole point is it walks you through

266
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,640
the the story of really mostly recent

267
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,480
history right it's talking about events

268
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,360
that have have happened over um the last

269
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,160
couple of years right and and also the

270
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,279
history of of industrial control but and

271
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,760
really the whole point of the book i

272
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,440
think from from his perspective and not

273
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
speaking for it but it really comes down

274
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,720
to this geopolitical consideration um

275
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,519
which you know i as a cyber security

276
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,920
defender have always tried to stay away

277
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,839
from right if we have an incident or

278
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,519
some type of compromise right it's

279
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,440
always focused about hey i want to

280
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,680
contain it right and eliminate it as

281
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,120
quickly as possible right get the

282
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,040
attacker off the network prevent them

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,839
from coming back ever again and

284
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,959
move on

285
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,040
i don't care where they're coming from i

286
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,640
don't care if they're associated with a

287
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,880
nation state or not right it's it's all

288
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,079
about just

289
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,079
protecting the business

290
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,760
and yet there are a lot of those

291
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,000
conversations to have around these

292
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,519
considerations now especially and the

293
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,839
main point and especially the title of

294
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,560
the presentation is when do we get to

295
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,440
the point where a nation

296
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
right launches a cyber attack that

297
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
results in some type of physical

298
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,279
response

299
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,560
so when does a bomb start dropping in

300
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,240
response to that cyber attack

301
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
and so it's it's that kind of common

302
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,399
theme that goes throughout sanwar so

303
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,399
it's an incredible book for those of you

304
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,560
that have read the cuckoo's egg right

305
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
which is you know chloe's book from

306
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,040
about 30 years ago talking about you

307
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,360
know the kind of that novelization of

308
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,279
incident response from from his

309
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,399
perspective and and ultimately tracking

310
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,160
nation state attackers they just weren't

311
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,240
so advanced back then

312
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
i i always think of sand worm really as

313
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,880
the and the the latest and greatest

314
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,519
version of of that type of book so if

315
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,839
you've enjoyed kuku's egg which i hear

316
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,240
from a lot of people um you know sand

317
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,160
worm again i see it kind of as this

318
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,440
philosophical successor to cuckoo's egg

319
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,519
and can't recommend it enough and this

320
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
is actually the book that we actually

321
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,279
read through it in that

322
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,600
industrial course that i'm doing

323
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,320
industrial control security class in in

324
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,639
december

325
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,720
so of course

326
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,320
who is sand worm right so sand worm for

327
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,600
of course

328
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
the movie is coming out in just a couple

329
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,279
of weeks it was my favorite movie um you

330
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,240
know uh you know many years ago uh it

331
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,839
was my favorite book oh it still is um

332
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,920
but you know the the idea of scene work

333
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,760
comes from where anybody want to throw

334
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,839
it out in discord

335
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,480
there have to be some people right

336
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,160
yeah definitely

337
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,680
yeah there's a few folks that are

338
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,240
throwing it out there yeah so so doom so

339
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,680
i'm really excited to see what they do

340
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,760
with the new new movie is supposed to be

341
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,959
absolutely phenomenal um so so i'm

342
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,399
really excited i want to actually

343
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,480
hopefully try and get time to read it

344
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,200
again before

345
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,680
i always think of like paul chalamet as

346
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,760
paula tradies but um or jason momoa is

347
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,680
i think kirti or um

348
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,240
uh duncan so we'll see we'll see i'm

349
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,040
sure it'll be amazing though so

350
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
but yeah it came from from

351
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,480
uh

352
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,200
one of the uh analysts that had actually

353
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,320
discovered the attackers um

354
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,480
um had linked or had found right links

355
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,360
to

356
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,240
sand worm across multiple companies

357
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
because the actual attackers used

358
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,160
references in their code

359
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,279
uh

360
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,279
that the references they took from doom

361
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,240
so they had different names uh from from

362
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,720
doom so like they had arrakis right

363
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,360
which is the the home planet or another

364
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
name for for doom

365
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,160
interesting uh side point and uh

366
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,079
i'll uh i'll throw out one of our uh

367
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,040
prizes uh for for anybody who knows this

368
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,240
little bit of trivia so the um solar

369
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
system in which

370
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,560
dune resides is also a solar system

371
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,760
in which another popular planet for

372
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,440
science fiction resides anybody know

373
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
yep so actually so uh xeroc you got it

374
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,160
yeah so it's actually the same solar

375
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,920
system as as a vulcan in uh star trek so

376
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,279
i thought that was pretty pretty

377
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,560
interesting

378
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,360
so pretty funny but i found that

379
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,440
actually doing google for wikipedia once

380
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,760
upon a time so

381
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,760
but sand worm is the the story of

382
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,040
you know

383
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,920
finding and tracking and learning about

384
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,199
this nation-state attack from

385
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,720
from russia

386
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
and so you see eventually we track it

387
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,320
down to okay it's unit 7445 in

388
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,240
the russia's military intelligence

389
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,959
agency the gru so i can't usually equate

390
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,160
that to

391
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,240
the nsa in the united states right

392
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,800
because the nsa is staffed with yes

393
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,040
private citizens but also a lot of folks

394
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,880
that come over from from different

395
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,279
branches of of the military right

396
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,600
they're loaned out like when rob i think

397
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,760
he was in the air force right rob lee

398
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,279
was in the air force when he went over

399
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,000
to

400
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,279
um

401
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,680
the nsa uh same thing with tim tomes who

402
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,519
was in the army when he was looking at

403
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,000
edgewayne the nsa

404
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,639
so so a lot of those top minds that that

405
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,839
come over from from military backgrounds

406
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,720
so um so sand worm as a whole right they

407
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,240
were responsible they were the group

408
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,040
responsible for the blackouts in the

409
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,519
ukraine so in 2015 around christmas time

410
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,680
right they turned off the power for

411
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
hundreds of thousands of citizens in the

412
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,519
middle of winter in the middle of night

413
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,440
and i could just imagine you know being

414
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,839
a father with with you know especially

415
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,519
little children and also we lose power

416
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,639
and it's the middle of winter it's like

417
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,040
what do you do i mean i just

418
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,680
mind blowing and then the russians just

419
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,600
not to be underdone right they came back

420
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,360
almost a year to the day and did it

421
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,839
again in 2016.

422
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,759
a different entity that they targeted

423
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,680
but they still resulted in the blackout

424
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,920
few few less victims as well but but

425
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,600
still it was a blackout right and all

426
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,320
these operators and power generation

427
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,720
facilities had to go to manual operation

428
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,199
so they got back up and running

429
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,720
right but they couldn't use their

430
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,040
automated control systems right it was

431
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,199
all back to manual operation so you had

432
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:28,880
people in facilities that weren't 100

433
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,680
safe right so they're in physical danger

434
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,000
to some degree you're flipping breakers

435
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,600
and flipping switches and manually

436
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,360
operating systems and they had to do

437
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,759
that for about six months before they

438
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,199
knew they could

439
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,759
rely once again on their control system

440
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,759
there was word that there was actually a

441
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,399
third blackout in 2017 where the

442
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
russians had come back almost a year to

443
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,639
the day and killed power off again that

444
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,560
one was just kept really hush-hush i

445
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,399
think the ukrainians just didn't

446
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,279
want

447
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,279
want to look any worse from a cyber

448
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,880
defense perspective than they already

449
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,119
did right well you talk about and

450
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,439
there's malware that that they had used

451
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,839
uh at the time so if you heard and i

452
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,079
don't even have black energy uh in

453
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,559
destroyer crash override from from

454
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,359
hackers right uh the movie kill disc was

455
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,839
was also their invention which they used

456
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,919
to to wipe machines

457
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,319
so which is also part these are part

458
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,199
tools right that evolve into not ketchup

459
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,520
so when we talk about not pecha right

460
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,600
that caused over you see a billion

461
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
dollars in in damages globally it's

462
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,640
probably well over two because most

463
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,720
companies when they report damages it's

464
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
usually about half of what actually

465
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,600
happened

466
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,880
so it's always those interesting

467
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,720
conversations you get to hear behind

468
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
closed doors it's like well yeah we we

469
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,120
lost you know 500 million it's like well

470
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,039
it's really closer to a billion or maybe

471
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,320
a little bit more

472
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,360
right

473
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
but we had you know some of the largest

474
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,760
companies that like maersk right and

475
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
mayor right the largest one of the

476
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
largest pharmaceutical manufacturers one

477
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,520
of the largest shipping companies in the

478
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,480
world right we're shut down for days and

479
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,600
and weeks right with global impact

480
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,200
right as much as as coved but back then

481
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,120
it was a huge

482
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,760
train on the supply chain and we saw

483
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,160
those those impacts right there's some

484
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,480
and again going back to andy greenberg

485
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,320
he has some great articles that he wrote

486
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,559
for wired that you can find on on

487
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,799
especially not petched and what happened

488
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,120
behind the scenes especially at marriage

489
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,760
um and how they had one domain

490
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,679
controller that was not touched because

491
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,640
of a blackout in africa at one of their

492
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,960
offices and that was their only backup

493
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,120
that they had to be able to restore the

494
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
entire company so it's a really

495
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,200
fascinating story but

496
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,799
so then we talk about french election

497
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,840
madeleine

498
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,240
the winter olympics attack and shadow

499
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,480
brokers right are all related

500
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,559
in some way shape or form with with

501
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
sandworm

502
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,160
um so and here's some of the folks that

503
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,080
are our sandworm

504
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,360
right and and they have um some

505
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,960
wonderful hacker candles um you know but

506
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
the whole point is

507
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,919
they're just other people um just like

508
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,320
you and i right i imagine like if i'm

509
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,480
working for the nsa right i mean this

510
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,240
would be me just you know the russians

511
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,799
would be looking at my picture like like

512
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,000
this

513
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,919
and and i also think of you know cyber

514
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,919
crime right and cyber criminals like i

515
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,520
can you know understand especially if

516
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,039
you know i didn't have a job or

517
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,559
especially if i i lived in an

518
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,840
environment

519
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,679
or a country where there weren't a lot

520
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,760
of options right i could understand

521
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
people turning to cyber crime to feed

522
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,679
their families

523
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,160
right completely so i'm not going to

524
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,240
blame anybody for you know especially

525
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,160
wanting to to serve their country ever

526
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,120
um

527
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,080
and

528
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,600
but at the same time

529
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,679
yeah they're on the the most wanted list

530
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,760
by the fbi now russia is never going to

531
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,000
extradite these these

532
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
um what we would say are you know

533
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,080
criminals right because you know they're

534
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,000
going to protect their own people and

535
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,200
it's interesting to have that

536
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,520
conversation because

537
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,320
well

538
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,280
we do the same thing right who's this

539
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,240
and i'm not giving away secrets here

540
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
but you know who this is he's definitely

541
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,039
a

542
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,039
big friend of besides acosta

543
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,480
say at least one person typing

544
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,120
see all the dots and then they go quiet

545
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,399
like one of those bad movies

546
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,200
he was an nsa member that was outed by

547
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
sanwar yeah so this is actually jake

548
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
williams and so if you ever go to b

549
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,120
sites augusta

550
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,159
um you'll see jake talking right super

551
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,320
great guy sue super smart as you can

552
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,280
imagine

553
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,679
he actually teaches the reverse malware

554
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,159
engineering and and um

555
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,720
most advanced malware authoring class

556
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,480
for sams right he owns uh he runs

557
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,039
i should say he runs uh radition uh

558
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,799
infosec

559
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,480
and so you'll see jake

560
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
like said i mean great guy right he

561
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,440
comes to share all the information um

562
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,280
with the community i think in this case

563
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,120
he was doing a presentation on privilege

564
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,559
escalation

565
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,159
and

566
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,840
at the same time yeah he he was outed

567
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,120
as a member of you know the the taylor

568
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,520
to access operations team at the nsa

569
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,679
which is also what a lot of outside

570
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,240
entities refer to as the equation group

571
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,799
right so so we call you know the the

572
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,640
sand worm attacker sam we're man they

573
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,200
call the the tailored access operations

574
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,880
group the equation group

575
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,760
and so jake was outed by the shadow

576
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,480
brokers on on twitter publicly as a

577
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,240
member of the equation group uh

578
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,559
potentially an author of stuxnet or

579
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,720
related

580
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,159
potentially i don't know

581
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,640
but the idea is and he mentions he's and

582
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,559
there's a great darknet uh diaries

583
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,880
episode that features this story he

584
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,559
mentions like he found this out right

585
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,960
before he was to travel for sans i think

586
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,360
it was singapore and he's like i can no

587
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,240
longer travel to singapore because i

588
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,200
could be extradited to to russia

589
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,760
for crimes against russia for being a

590
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,280
member of tailored access operations

591
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,200
right so the whole point is i think it's

592
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,360
it's just the story of

593
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,840
you know it's it's looking at all sides

594
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,880
of

595
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,280
the story right i always say if you cut

596
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,080
me open i i bleed red white and blue

597
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,880
right

598
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,960
but we have to remember you know the

599
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,400
other people that are

600
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,840
across the the table from us

601
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,679
and and

602
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,840
we're all here and we're all trying to

603
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,760
serve our country right in

604
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,080
in the best way possible well

605
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,000
what we find though is and this is you

606
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,480
know a great part of you know sand worm

607
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,679
is we see that you know we as private

608
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,799
citizens or we as operators of control

609
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,360
system facilities like power plants

610
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,840
petrochemical facilities water treatment

611
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,480
facilities right we're caught in the

612
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,080
crossfires

613
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,039
the crossfire of of these nation states

614
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,440
typically you know most attackers

615
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,159
against control system facilities are

616
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,360
going to be

617
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,120
nation states

618
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,320
now we're seeing that start to change so

619
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
a lot of you probably have heard and

620
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,320
maybe we're in fact that are

621
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,600
impacted by the colonial pipeline breach

622
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,840
that we had in was it march

623
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,919
i remember thankfully i was living in

624
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,279
lexington for most of the time but i

625
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,200
remember coming back to greenville after

626
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,919
a week had had gone by the pipeline was

627
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,320
up and running but most gas stations

628
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,200
were still out of gas i tried like five

629
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,600
or six different qt gas stations and

630
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,880
like everybody was was out of gas

631
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
because of a

632
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
control system outage now it wasn't an

633
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,320
attack

634
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,960
against control systems

635
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,919
specifically it was just the back office

636
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,600
at the the

637
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,840
company that runs the pipeline became

638
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
infected with ransomware just we'll say

639
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
generic ransomware

640
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,120
and that

641
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
they were afraid that that ransomware

642
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,159
would

643
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,840
shift into the control system

644
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,360
environment so they shut down all the

645
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,600
control systems that ran that pipeline

646
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,919
so then the pipeline goes down

647
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,000
there's one thing you have to remember

648
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,240
nowadays is that

649
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,200
the vast majority of control systems now

650
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,080
and you talk about things like plc's or

651
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,880
data mines right programmable logical

652
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,279
logic controllers or human management

653
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,320
interfaces or we'll talk about um

654
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,640
data historians or

655
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,000
um

656
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,600
uh

657
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,039
translators yeah

658
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,400
there's tons of

659
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,960
terms we can throw out there at the end

660
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,240
of the day

661
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,400
the vast majority now

662
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,000
they run windows

663
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,400
or they run linux right some some flavor

664
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,640
a window some flavor of linux

665
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,919
and so from a network security

666
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,279
perspective right

667
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,320
it's just another host on the network

668
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,400
with an iep address

669
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,480
with listening services and

670
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,720
vulnerabilities that we could

671
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,559
potentially remotely exploit

672
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,279
it just has a different

673
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,799
effect

674
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,360
so instead of accessing a database

675
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,880
server right with sensitive information

676
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,279
like credit card numbers or social

677
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,880
security numbers

678
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,120
right it's maybe a windows machine or a

679
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,240
linux machine that's responsible for

680
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,799
turning a large turbine that's used to

681
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,840
generate electricity

682
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,159
if i can access that system can i shut

683
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,640
down the turbine right or can i make it

684
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,520
you speed up or slow down right

685
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,360
potentially right just depends on how

686
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,120
that system is is set up and configured

687
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,520
now we also have this idea of industrial

688
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,840
internet of things so this is where we

689
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,039
take industrial control systems

690
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,360
and we connect them to the internet so i

691
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,840
think yeah in a simple form right when i

692
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,520
was mentioning the floor engineer that

693
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,720
took a little solenoid in his garden and

694
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,640
connected it via a web page to the

695
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,360
internet so he could hit the web page

696
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,559
and turn on his sprinklers

697
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,640
in this case think of if i do take that

698
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,679
turbine that spins to generate power and

699
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,840
put that on the internet

700
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,480
and that's a whole other story

701
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,559
right so we started to think there's

702
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,559
even additional

703
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,480
cyber security concerns right when we

704
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,440
talk about taking control systems and

705
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,200
connecting them to the internet and

706
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,880
allowing them to be

707
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,440
monitored and potentially

708
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,840
controlled from the internet

709
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,080
and i'm i'll also mention we have i have

710
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,840
a ton of slides in here and it's just

711
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,679
mostly for reference material we're

712
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,440
obviously not going to get to all this

713
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,159
right but in control system security you

714
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,679
know in cyber security in general we

715
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,440
always talk about confidentiality

716
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,760
integrity and availability already

717
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,039
alluded to

718
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,440
control system environments the main

719
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,000
focus is availability

720
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
if i am a power plant operator right

721
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,679
it's all about making sure that power

722
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,919
plant stays up and generating

723
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,279
electricity

724
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,080
right

725
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,200
that's the only thing that matters to me

726
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,039
now we've started to see you know

727
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,640
operators over the last couple years

728
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,399
understand right

729
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,159
part of that availability is making sure

730
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,240
they're secure so somebody can't bring

731
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,000
them down through something as simple as

732
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,399
ransomware or a more sophisticated

733
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,360
nation-state attack

734
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,240
and so

735
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,320
cyber security has come into play for a

736
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,240
lot of these operators over the last

737
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,320
couple of years

738
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,640
but again just think that

739
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,159
there's still primarily always worried

740
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,159
about staying up and running

741
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,760
you know they're not worried about is

742
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,000
your data encrypted right or are we

743
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,399
verifying signatures for for data that

744
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,360
we're importing from a remote system

745
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,159
for the vast majority of these operators

746
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,000
it doesn't matter right it's all about

747
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,799
keeping the plan up and running

748
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,720
so it's our job as cyber security

749
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,880
professionals to help them understand

750
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
how they can secure the environment just

751
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,960
like again we can help developers that

752
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,120
don't understand security we can help

753
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,918
them understand how to write secure code

754
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,120
and so

755
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,279
we talk about there's a lot of

756
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,000
risk that we talk about in industrial

757
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
control environments and we talk about

758
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,679
different types of attackers and there's

759
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,799
really nation states and some some you

760
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,320
know random groups like ransomware

761
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,480
operators that have the option to be

762
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,919
able to

763
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,120
um you know

764
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,159
impact the environment

765
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,880
we talk about

766
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,000
cyber warfare which again is a big focus

767
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,799
of this presentation because again

768
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,480
we're getting caught in the middle i

769
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,320
don't work for the military i've worked

770
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,240
with the military before i got to spend

771
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
time with the marines i actually

772
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,080
practically grew up on camp pendleton

773
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,679
because of my grandfather i got to work

774
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,559
with the the navy seals for about two

775
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,720
years which was really exciting

776
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,039
uh but i've never been in in the

777
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,919
military right so but we as private

778
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,840
citizens and private

779
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,679
public organizations are getting caught

780
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,760
in the crossfire

781
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,000
right and we can talk about the history

782
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,320
right and get sandworm does a great job

783
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,200
of covering the highlights

784
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,799
where the big one i want to talk about

785
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,039
though is stuxnet so probably most of

786
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,320
you have heard of stuxnet right which is

787
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,600
where

788
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,640
nation states going to cyber war

789
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,559
really started

790
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,039
so when we look at stuxnet right it was

791
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,200
created and it was used by who there

792
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,360
were two countries that used it to

793
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,880
target iran

794
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,760
right

795
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,960
what were the two countries that

796
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,000
targeted iran with stuxnet

797
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,640
yeah was the united states and israel

798
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,720
and so that's really and it goes back to

799
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,880
it's one of the main points in the book

800
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,760
is stuxnet was the first point in

801
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,960
history

802
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,640
where

803
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,840
a one nation state at least was known

804
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,960
right to

805
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,559
target another

806
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,960
nation state

807
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,559
and of course the united states and

808
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,799
israelis their idea was they wanted us

809
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,240
to

810
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,320
to delay the iranians in developing a

811
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,120
nuclear bomb and so stuxnet was

812
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
developed

813
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,000
to intra

814
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,159
the centrifuges that the iranians were

815
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,640
using at the natanz facility in iran to

816
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,880
enrich uranium

817
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,000
and so

818
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,880
the americans have had discussions about

819
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
do we drop bombs

820
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,799
where we could potentially

821
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,960
kill people and have collateral damage

822
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,279
or hey why don't we take this

823
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,640
cyber approach

824
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,720
and we can do this without dropping the

825
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,519
bombs and without killing anybody so i

826
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,519
like that idea right that's that's great

827
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,039
i mean we're not killing you know

828
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,240
innocent civilians and scientists

829
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,159
but at the same time once it was

830
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,519
discovered

831
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,840
this is where other countries like

832
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,760
russia and like china and other

833
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,840
countries around the world really took

834
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,559
note and said you know one was hey the

835
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,200
united states right

836
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,799
nothing happened to the united states or

837
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,799
the israelis for stocks now right there

838
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,880
were no repercussions so it's like well

839
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,240
if you can do it well then i could do it

840
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,840
too

841
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,760
and then at the same time i think it was

842
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,880
showing that

843
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,080
the

844
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,480
other groups like china and in russia

845
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,919
that that

846
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,440
wow that was actually some pretty

847
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,919
impressive code right stuxnet actually

848
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,559
used four zero days

849
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,320
and not only that but did target

850
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,159
specific industrial control environments

851
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,799
like cement

852
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,320
and so it they really started to step up

853
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,000
their game at that point and it was

854
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,480
really it was just that that escalation

855
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,760
where everybody was off to the races

856
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,960
so for a lot of us being in the united

857
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,200
states right we actually started all of

858
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,559
this

859
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,960
to to some degree right and there's a

860
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
lot of nuances in that conversation but

861
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,880
at a high level we're the ones that

862
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,480
picked the fight

863
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,080
and now we look at where we're at today

864
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,000
where again that's where san worm is

865
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,640
great because and if you get the latest

866
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,880
edition right it's fairly updated so no

867
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,399
it doesn't cover anything that's

868
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,159
happened over the last year or two

869
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,159
because i remember the last time i did

870
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,840
this presentation at the isa group and

871
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,159
this was i think in february so in

872
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,320
then literally the next day there was an

873
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,480
article about biden talking about

874
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,440
physical response to cyber attacks

875
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,360
so i do want to mention if you want to

876
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,720
learn more about control system uh cyber

877
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,440
security the best place you can go to is

878
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,240
drago's dragos does their year in review

879
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,000
report so you can think of this as the

880
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
the verizon data breach investigation

881
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,840
report right the dvir

882
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,679
but for control system environments

883
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,919
right dragos is run by rob

884
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,840
lee or they go rob emily because he

885
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,320
teaches the sans uh grid class it's

886
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,799
incident response in

887
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,279
industrial control environments and and

888
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,600
you know like i said phenomenal class

889
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,960
he's a phenomenal person um and does

890
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,519
some amazing work with with dragos and

891
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,880
and sans around control system and

892
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,880
cyber security right but they talk about

893
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,960
here's all the and i again here's here's

894
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,200
all of this this whole timeline that

895
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,440
that just from 2020

896
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,159
right everything that happened where was

897
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,080
targeting control system environments

898
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,720
what all this amounts to is there's

899
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,799
new groups that are continually coming

900
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,519
out

901
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,360
right targeting control system

902
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,440
environments and whether they're nation

903
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,919
states or now we're seeing ransomware

904
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,880
operators actually building in code to

905
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,440
target specific industrial control

906
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,000
environments so it's not just the nation

907
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,520
states any long

908
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,359
right that they're breaking in and

909
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,679
access information and we still see

910
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,800
groups like sand worm out there

911
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,359
and of course we wrapped up 2020 last

912
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,839
year with the solarwinds breach

913
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,159
which was devastating when you talk

914
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,520
about a foreign entity having access to

915
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,000
every email message in the pentagon

916
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,280
or the department of treasury or able to

917
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,239
yeah

918
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,879
read the windows source code

919
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,679
right because they were in microsoft for

920
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,359
months as well

921
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,199
amazing right that's amazing where i

922
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,879
have to admire it from a technical

923
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,639
capability

924
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,280
perspective

925
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,599
but draco's also in their year in review

926
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,000
right they talk about some of the issues

927
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,639
that they have

928
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,640
and that they see

929
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,119
and you can see that that second point i

930
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,079
talk about

931
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,200
88

932
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,440
of their pen test engagements they

933
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,839
easily get into the control system

934
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,119
environment from the back office wow

935
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,359
that's really concerning

936
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,960
you see 50

937
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,040
or 54 percent of networks had shared

938
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,720
credentials between the back office

939
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,320
where everybody sits and they browse the

940
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,480
internet and work on spreadsheets and

941
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,240
read their email and then the control

942
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,240
system

943
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,160
that's pretty concerning as well right

944
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,160
so your username and password work in

945
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
the control or the back office where

946
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
most attackers start

947
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,000
and they find a path into the control

948
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,599
systems which

949
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,520
is almost always

950
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,440
there as well

951
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,000
then they can use those same credentials

952
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,320
in the control system environment

953
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,760
and so a lot of control system

954
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,040
environments again

955
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,720
they're not built with security a lot of

956
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,720
them are 20 30 40 50 years old i think

957
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,240
of some of the nuclear power plants that

958
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,280
we have

959
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,960
how long they've existed a lot of our

960
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,480
power plants just in general have

961
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,680
existed

962
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,760
and so there's a lot of concern

963
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,440
so we have to

964
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,160
work to again this is where we as cyber

965
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,240
security professionals i don't have to

966
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,440
understand how a control system works

967
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,400
now

968
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,720
it's great and you should have a basic

969
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,000
understanding that's the whole point of

970
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,839
why i put together the industrial

971
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,200
control class and i'm doing it for free

972
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,359
to help you understand because then you

973
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,520
can take your cyber security knowledge

974
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,839
and bring it into industrial control

975
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,079
environments i work in a

976
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,800
50 billion with a b

977
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,280
you know liquid natural gas facility

978
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,800
we're building

979
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,119
for one of the largest energy companies

980
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,720
in the world

981
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,599
and i don't do anything special that i

982
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,640
wouldn't do for a small company with 10

983
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,800
computers realistically

984
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,040
it's all the same basics

985
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,400
believe it or not

986
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,320
so a lot of people i understand aren't

987
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,400
interested in control system security

988
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,880
because control systems can seem very

989
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,200
just like this very almost abstract

990
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,760
saying that we don't understand

991
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
and at the same day at the same time

992
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,720
those systems are just other computers

993
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,880
now control system engineers hate it

994
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,400
when you say that

995
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,079
but you know what

996
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,920
it's got a processor it's got memory

997
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,560
it's got a you know network interface

998
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,960
probably has an ip address now probably

999
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,800
running a web server

1000
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,599
right

1001
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,680
it's running windows or linux

1002
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,079
essentially or some other operating

1003
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,960
system

1004
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
and so it can it's

1005
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,760
if you're even remotely

1006
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,400
interested in control system right

1007
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,839
environments right the world needs you

1008
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,320
right we need you to bring that cyber

1009
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
security experience to the table and

1010
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,119
help these environments understand how

1011
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,920
to secure them and don't be intimidated

1012
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,800
by

1013
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,200
plcs and hmis and all the acronyms that

1014
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,640
are out there because you can learn

1015
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,880
those and you can understand again

1016
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,640
they're just other systems with ip

1017
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,320
addresses on the network

1018
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,839
running windows and running linux

1019
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,119
so again there's a lot of great

1020
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,560
information of course in the slides for

1021
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,960
reference a lot of this comes from the

1022
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,079
the draco's years the year in review so

1023
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,320
go to their website and access the

1024
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,000
report it's all free

1025
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,800
they do again an amazing work

1026
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,200
um when they put those together

1027
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,480
so again why are we here right and we're

1028
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
getting caught in the crossfire right if

1029
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,280
i'm an administrator for america mayors

1030
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,960
right or the hospital where they

1031
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
actually had to turn away ambulances and

1032
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,560
patients because all their systems were

1033
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
down because it was infected by not

1034
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,839
touching where everything got white

1035
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,960
we're getting caught in the crossfire

1036
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,119
with russia going after the ukraine

1037
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,200
which is what not pecha was

1038
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,280
or what if it is russia going after the

1039
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,800
united states or the united states going

1040
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,400
after russia or china or right a lot of

1041
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,000
interesting conversations i have that i

1042
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,280
have to be careful about when i do

1043
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,800
presentations for

1044
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,200
our employees in russia and china and

1045
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,520
all this other country

1046
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,880
what is the impact to critical

1047
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
infrastructure now most environments

1048
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,119
especially in the united states are very

1049
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,280
resilient they're not perfect but

1050
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,760
you're not going to have a

1051
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,400
total blackout because of a cyber attack

1052
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,280
you're not going to have a nuclear power

1053
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,839
plant explode into a mushroom cloud

1054
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,440
because of a cyber attack because

1055
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,520
there's lots of there's physical

1056
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,839
controls that are also engineered into

1057
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,079
the design so it's

1058
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,119
simply not possible to have that can

1059
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,119
certain damages occur yes could somebody

1060
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,200
get hurt locally or die

1061
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,160
yes

1062
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,200
but it's very limited but those still

1063
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,440
all horrible consequences

1064
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,800
so again

1065
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,400
the geopolitical the military

1066
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,359
considerations right when does physical

1067
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:58,720
war

1068
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,160
right

1069
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,960
become that escalation point to a cyber

1070
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,200
attack

1071
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,359
so and then where we go right solar

1072
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,200
winds right when that hit i mean that

1073
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,599
was huge and we're i think still even

1074
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,160
finding out a lot of the repercussions

1075
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,440
right there

1076
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,599
but it's damaged so just a lot to think

1077
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,839
about but again if you're interested in

1078
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,480
control system environments even in the

1079
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,920
littlest right again don't be

1080
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,280
intimidated

1081
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,839
right learn as much as you can but bring

1082
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,880
your skills to the table to help these

1083
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
other control system engineers secure

1084
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,599
their environments

1085
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,520
that's what i mentioned in a couple

1086
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,359
upcoming classes right we're doing the

1087
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,200
uh the two-day free workshop for pen

1088
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,359
testing on november fourth fifth uh the

1089
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,520
one day incident response which is uh

1090
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,640
ninety nine dollars with all the

1091
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,960
proceeds going to ice mb size and the

1092
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,119
intro to industrial control systems so

1093
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,839
we'll actually talk about what is a plc

1094
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,599
what is an hmi right why are they what's

1095
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,400
a data historian why are these important

1096
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,359
and then how we secure them and what

1097
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,720
you'll see if you're familiar with how

1098
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,680
to secure general environments

1099
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,839
we use the same tactics and techniques

1100
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,920
so hopefully

1101
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,280
everybody

1102
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,119
enjoyed the presentation oh thanks chris

1103
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,560
for putting the uh the link out there so

1104
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,119
i i appreciate that so and not to keep

1105
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,520
anybody over because i know we got uh a

1106
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,760
couple minutes just until uh

1107
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,680
the uh next presentation so but uh

1108
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,760
and then chris is actually up next but

1109
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,119
i'll uh go and

1110
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,599
take com uh questions for uh

1111
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,119
the next uh

1112
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,119
minute or two if anybody has any other

1113
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,240
ones um i say and shane makes a great

1114
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,920
point right when we talk about

1115
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,000
industrial control systems i can think

1116
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,839
of big turbines that

1117
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,800
you are are turned to to power you know

1118
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,400
hundreds of thousands of homes and at

1119
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,560
the same time we also think of other

1120
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,800
automated systems like

1121
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,520
hvac right so technically when you think

1122
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,119
of even a thermostat right or a system

1123
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,359
that that can control that heating and

1124
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,680
that ac unit right that is

1125
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,400
a industrial control system

1126
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,240
right we were actually looking at in my

1127
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,760
greenville tech class we were actually

1128
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,560
doing showdown research uh and seeing

1129
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,400
what types of systems we could find out

1130
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,640
there and finding control system

1131
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,079
systems that are connected to the

1132
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,240
internet we actually found

1133
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,680
it was actually the

1134
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,720
hvac system for the

1135
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,359
the president of furman university so it

1136
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,280
actually is just funny and we were just

1137
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,440
randomly looking around the world and

1138
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,839
actually saw greenville south carolina

1139
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,319
pop up it was like what's this

1140
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,560
and then it actually was the yeah the

1141
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,200
hvac system for the the president's

1142
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,359
house and furman and it was even labeled

1143
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,359
they have a special name for the house

1144
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,400
um

1145
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,319
what was it you don't remember oh my

1146
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,560
girlfriend went to winterferressa

1147
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,319
she knew what it was back then she

1148
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,680
forgot alright

1149
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,119
but but yeah it was that was the name so

1150
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,079
uh

1151
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,319
so it was kind of kind of funny to

1152
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,720
to see that
