going on about 13 14 years

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,280

energy uh working for operation national

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,000
laboratory where did a lot of security

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,800
um and you know kind of government

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,480
contracts you know at the time we had

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,079
three of the

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,840
the world's fastest super computers so

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
did a lot of security around that dod

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,280
projects

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,520
um and if you're not familiar with ornls

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
were part of the manhattan project

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,760
during world war ii um when it did a lot

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
of the you know building the bombs and

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,799
stuff but now it's a really large

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,799
research laboratory so got exposed to a

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,960
lot of good science research and things

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,280
if you guys are into that sort of thing

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,520
did a stand at the university of

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
tennessee helping build their security

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,759
program moved on to nielsen where i did

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,759
a lot of you know security operations

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,080
pin testing doing the red teaming and

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,880
stuff there um and now

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,560
i used to and then when i moved to

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,479
averitium i let our managed security

44
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,520
practice so security operations um you

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,360
know making sure that

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,640
you know basically a lot of the stuff

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,400
that ryan you just talked about you know

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,840
operationally making sure we had the

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
right processes procedures in place to

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,840
help protect our customers on a

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,320
day-to-day basis so i'm really excited

52
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,560
to be here today um

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,240
and as we go through here i don't know

54
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,680
if people are allowed to ask questions

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,079
or whatever you know feel free to jump

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,399
in um i'd love for this to be

57
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,680
interactive

58
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
uh you know it gets gets kind of lonely

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,799
up here without any interaction so you

60
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,040
guys feel free to jump in

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,280
interrupt ask questions

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,160
and i'll go ahead and get started

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,800
so today this is a quick outline

64
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,640
if you got to see the abstract what

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,040
we're talking about today is is really

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,720
just nothing new

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,800
but hopefully it'll give you a few

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,120
tidbits or things that you can take back

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
to your organization to help with you

70
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,480
know security operations threat hunting

71
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
instant response i mean just general

72
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,360
investigation within your organizations

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,760
because i know everybody here probably

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
comes from different size organizations

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,879
you know not everybody works for a

76
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,200
fortune 500 uh where you might have a

77
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,959
hundred people on your security team

78
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,040
plus or you know we probably have some

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
people in here that you're the i.t

80
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,599
person the security person and the cso

81
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,879
and you know you wear all the hats

82
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,599
within the organization um so hopefully

83
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,120
there's some things in here that are

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,720
beneficial to

85
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
you know that full wide range of

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,599
audience

87
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,120
because i think some of the concepts

88
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,440
that you'll see in here can be leveraged

89
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,239
across the board um so we'll just do a

90
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,159
quick history intro i kind of hit some

91
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,920
history about myself there i'll

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
introduce some things that you know are

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
probably not new to everybody here

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,680
you've probably seen them before in a

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
lot of other talks

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,200
that you've been to

97
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,720
and then we'll move into some you know

98
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,200
why notebooks there's been a lot of work

99
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,360
you know cyber war dog does a lot of

100
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
great things around threat hunting

101
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,280
playbooks and stuff

102
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,720
but i want to put just a little spin on

103
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,480
that and and hopefully bring it up a

104
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,120
level um a lot of times you know when

105
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,440
you're in security operations you're you

106
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
know the technical guy in the room you

107
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,720
spend a lot of time you know in the

108
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,480
command line or the sim or your

109
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
technologies and sometimes you might

110
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,440
lose

111
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,720
the

112
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,239
you know kind of what's the business

113
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,879
driver here how can i relate this to

114
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,879
you know what the company needs and can

115
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,319
i leverage my technical expertise to

116
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,400
you know show leadership why we need to

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,280
do certain things so um we'll go into a

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,920
little detail on that so

119
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,200
moving in um so what are the concepts

120
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,720
that you know we like to use at a

121
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,280
verdium and you see this a lot is

122
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,760
transitioning from that old aspect

123
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,639
around you know traditional sec ops and

124
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,720
really into more of a cyber fusion

125
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,839
approach

126
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,080
and you know what we'll go into here a

127
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,840
little bit is you know we have two main

128
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
themes and it's really around know

129
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,759
thyself and know thy enemy today we're

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,919
really going to focus on know thy enemy

131
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,960
you know because that's really where the

132
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,120
threat honey comes in you need to know a

133
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,880
little bit of yourself right because

134
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,440
that really drives where you can do

135
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,919
you know some specific threat hunts but

136
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,120
when you're doing the threat hunting

137
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
right i mean that's the key word is the

138
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,160
threat right what is the threat actor

139
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
doing what are they looking for what are

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,880
the types of information you know that

141
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,120
they're looking for to be able to

142
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,040
to protect and

143
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,759
um i've only seen cover slider

144
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,720
presentation

145
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,680
yeah nick

146
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
we're only seeing uh looks like the

147
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,919
powerpoint um

148
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,120
view

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
it's not even in presenter mode so we

150
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,039
just see the avertium slide it's

151
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,719
okay

152
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,440
uh maybe stop sharing and reshare it

153
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
looks like you may be frozen i don't see

154
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,960
a cursor moving on your screen either

155
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,280
okay

156
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,000
we'll try that again

157
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
we'll see the cyber fusion slide now all

158
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,960
right perfect hey thanks uh

159
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,280
tim there for let me know um so yeah so

160
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,639
this is what we're going into here just

161
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,000
you know now now that you have the

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,840
visual is really you know this concept

163
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,000
of pulling all the pieces together into

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,560
this more of a cyber fusion and having

165
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,199
the different parts of security really

166
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,800
working together not having your

167
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
governance and your risk and compliance

168
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,960
and policy team doing their thing in one

169
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,680
area having you know your red team do

170
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,520
one thing your blue team do another it's

171
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,199
really how do you come together and have

172
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,600
this kind of fusion structure

173
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,400
and

174
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,240
by doing that one of the things that we

175
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,840
like to focus on

176
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,400
is is really around how do we assess and

177
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,720
measure maturity it can be you know in

178
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,479
the first where like know myself you

179
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,319
know you might be using a security

180
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,639
framework like the nist csf you could be

181
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,240
using you know the cis top 20 or i guess

182
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
it's the top 18 now i'm obviously it's

183
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,440
going to take me a long time to get used

184
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,479
to that but you know really focusing in

185
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,160
on like what are the security controls

186
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,240
and things and really measuring to that

187
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,600
going forward

188
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
and

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,240
this is you know pretty standard

190
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,680
maturity model and you're going to see

191
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,080
how we try to apply this not only from

192
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,600
say a holistic

193
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
program level standpoint but how can we

194
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,800
apply this at a more tactical technical

195
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,639
level around how you're doing your

196
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,880
thread heading how you're diving in and

197
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
really relating that up into

198
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,599
you know business decisions business

199
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,000
risk and the things that your executives

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,479
you know really care about um you know

201
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,319
being in the industry here for 13 14

202
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,240
years you know it's it's one of those

203
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,160
things to where

204
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,080
you know if you want to be a really good

205
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,000
security professional you know for the

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
most part at least if you want to move

207
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
up i'm not going to say let me just

208
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,039
rephrase that but as you move up in the

209
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,759
organization you really have to start

210
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,120
understanding what's important in the

211
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,319
business and a lot of times you're

212
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,800
having to sell you're either selling up

213
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,880
you're selling to other people on your

214
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,639
team you know that could be another

215
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,160
security engineer that you're working

216
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,319
with that could be the cis admin that

217
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,560
could be the application owner there's a

218
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,199
lot of things that go into you know kind

219
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,599
of the the political landscape within

220
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,120
the organization so hopefully some of

221
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,800
these things that we go over will help

222
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
with that

223
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
so starting with some frameworks um

224
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,599
you know i think you know if you go to

225
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,440
any security talk nowadays especially

226
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,680
within security operations i'm sure

227
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,080
moderate attack you've probably heard a

228
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,520
million times we could probably turn

229
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,280
this into a drinking game

230
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,879
but you know it's still a really

231
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,680
important thing when it comes to

232
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,840
measuring success within your security

233
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,240
operations center and like what should i

234
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,479
be looking for when i'm out there

235
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,560
spending my time you know digging

236
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,879
through the sim digging through my logs

237
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,960
or my endpoint or my edr or whatever

238
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,360
that is to really get a sense of what i

239
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
should be looking for

240
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,479
and they can't be you know we can't um

241
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,800
you know with that adding to that though

242
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,080
what are some other things that we can

243
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
really add to that from a a security

244
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
perspective

245
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,679
so jumping in from a threat hunt

246
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,760
perspective right so

247
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,120
trying to level set as you know if

248
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,880
you're new to security operations you're

249
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,479
not quite sure you know like so what is

250
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,679
this threat hunting that we're talking

251
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,760
about today you know so threat hunting

252
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,600
is you know just really the process of

253
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
proactively going and looking for stuff

254
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
you know it's in the key thing when

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
you're when you're going to go look for

256
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,760
stuff right is you need to have data to

257
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,680
be able to sift through so you'll see

258
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,760
here this is just a high level process

259
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,399
diagram um if you go to the internet you

260
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
know this is pretty straightforward uh

261
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,320
you know nothing necessarily

262
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
groundbreaking and it's a pretty

263
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,320
straightforward concept right is instead

264
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,640
of sitting around and waiting for your

265
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,360
tools and technologies to to tell you to

266
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,600
do something it's like why don't we take

267
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
the time to actually go into our

268
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,839
technologies and see what we can find

269
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,680
based on certain intelligence and stuff

270
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,200
that we see

271
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,360
and when we think about you know what we

272
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,080
can look for you know at a verdi and we

273
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,839
think of it as really as in three

274
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,040
different

275
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,360
buckets you have your more what i like

276
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,279
to call your your more temporal stuff

277
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,200
the things that are maybe

278
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,680
of urgency maybe you've got a

279
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,560
threat intelligence report from some

280
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,800
uh threat vendor that you all have or

281
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,680
maybe some you know uh c cert that went

282
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,040
out that said hey you know this

283
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,519
particular apt group is looking and

284
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,320
exploiting x y and z you know you think

285
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,800
of your solar gates think of you know

286
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
the dark side with colonial pipeline

287
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
think of you know some of the more

288
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
recent ones you know there's there's a

289
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,399
lot of different

290
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,240
you know things that you can turn on the

291
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,079
news and say wait a second what's going

292
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,440
on

293
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,760
then you have the bucket more around

294
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,800
what we kind of caught this is the

295
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,079
catch-all right this is where you're

296
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,519
using miter attack to where regardless

297
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,240
you know of who the apt group is behind

298
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,959
it and having very specific procedures

299
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,720
you know that they're going to be using

300
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,360
is you know if you just hire a pen

301
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,440
tester or if you're doing red teaming

302
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
yourself internally these are the steps

303
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,440
and techniques that you might leverage

304
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,120
within your environment you know if

305
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,720
y'all were on the talk you know earlier

306
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,800
with you know ryan you know he went over

307
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,399
you know low bins and you know living

308
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,640
off the land techniques and and certain

309
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
things there right is you know

310
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
regardless of who the you know bad guy

311
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,240
is you know it could be a good guy or a

312
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
bad guy if someone's doing offensive

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,079
security there's certain things that you

314
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,519
leverage to try to get into those

315
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,680
environments so really doing just those

316
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,480
more generic uh kind of catch-all type

317
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,760
of hunts

318
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,200
and then the final one the way we look

319
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,680
at it is really identifying iocs and

320
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,600
this one you know i you know it could be

321
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
considered you know threat hunting you

322
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
know sometimes this is more just a

323
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,279
continuing investigation but when you do

324
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,920
find particular iocs you know maybe you

325
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,720
were

326
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
um you know doing an investigation you

327
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,800
saw one of your workstations or servers

328
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,440
that that got hit with you know a piece

329
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,279
of ransomware or piece of malware or

330
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,680
whatever else and you find those

331
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,920
registry keys or the ip addresses that

332
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,000
maybe it was reaching out to and you

333
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
start doing a deeper dive investigation

334
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,240
across your entire environment for where

335
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,720
else you know that might happen right is

336
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,079
maybe it was a phishing email that

337
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,560
someone clicked on and you found it on

338
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,959
one system but did other people get that

339
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,880
same phishing email did they click on it

340
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,680
so using some of those iocs you can do

341
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,360
some of those threat hunts across your

342
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,000
environment you know and really see you

343
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,360
know what was the the scale of that

344
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,959
particular attack

345
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,399
and so once we establish those

346
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,480
hypotheses right then we perform those

347
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,160
hunts you know and and then you have to

348
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,680
utilize your technologies in your

349
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,360
environment and like i said earlier you

350
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
know

351
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,519
you know you there's a lot of great

352
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,040
tools out there but not everybody has

353
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
access to the latest greatest cdrs you

354
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,279
know you don't have access to

355
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
you know maybe a sim maybe you're just

356
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,920
sending stuff into a syslog server and

357
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,760
you have to comb through and have custom

358
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,000
scripts that you comb through those logs

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,920
to try to find things you know it's not

360
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,079
everybody has the liberties to have you

361
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,079
know an unlimited budget to spend on

362
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,120
security so whatever that is is right

363
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,880
you need you need to understand what

364
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,279
your capabilities are and then be able

365
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,639
to go and then look within those

366
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,560
particular environments

367
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,240
and then once you do those hunts right

368
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,720
refine those detections you know as as

369
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,560
you go in and you you start out with

370
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
that first hypothesis you might get tons

371
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,959
and tons of information back you know

372
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,959
the the classic example right is your

373
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,320
power shell you know powershell is

374
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,240
something that people use within your

375
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
environment and if you go and just say

376
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
hey show me everywhere power shells

377
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
being run in my environment you might

378
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
get hundreds and thousands and and

379
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,760
thousands of different

380
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
um you know techniques that end up you

381
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,440
know coming back or you know results

382
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,200
that come back and you might have to

383
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,959
refine that detection over and over

384
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,040
again but the good thing is is once you

385
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
refine those detections over time those

386
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,360
those detections and analytics get

387
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
better and then at that point right you

388
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,120
detect those threats once you've defined

389
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
and build out those detections and then

390
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,880
you move into the actual triage

391
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,040
remediates right this is once you find

392
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,639
those within your environment what are

393
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,880
your playbooks how do you get those out

394
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,800
and how do you make sure that you know

395
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,560
they don't get in again by using lessons

396
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,440
learned

397
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,519
for the future

398
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,880
and so

399
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,720
taking a step further right so we had

400
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
mentioned earlier it's like so where do

401
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,120
you focus when it comes to thread

402
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
hunting um you know you talked about

403
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,399
those developing those hypotheses and if

404
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,760
you're not familiar with this this is a

405
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,320
pyramid of pain um i think it's a it's a

406
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,600
bianco that

407
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,240
that uh came up with this that you know

408
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,839
if you're really gonna focus your time

409
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,760
you know where should you do it at and

410
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
that's where the ttps come in

411
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
you know you could spend all day looking

412
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,920
for ip addresses

413
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,760
hash values domain names but how easy is

414
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,639
it for a bad guy to actually go in and

415
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,800
change those things right is hey i have

416
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
a piece of ransomware malware it drops

417
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,360
to a box and you know

418
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
how many times does that hash value you

419
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
know change once it gets written and a

420
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
lot of times people don't write to disk

421
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,519
anymore right they're staying in memory

422
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,120
so a lot of these techniques you know

423
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
just don't really work i mean that's why

424
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
you see a lot of av solutions

425
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,399
you know dying is because that detection

426
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,320
mechanism is not something that really

427
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,240
works and then maybe you're a good blue

428
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,320
team or you keep to do you you go take

429
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,240
that piece of malware you detonate it

430
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,560
and you find the ip addresses that you

431
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,720
know were in there you know you go put a

432
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,839
you know a firewall block in place and

433
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,680
next thing you know you still see

434
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,360
traffic going out because guess what

435
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,800
there was actually some domain names

436
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,199
that those were those ip addresses were

437
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,440
registered to so you continue to do your

438
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,399
research

439
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,839
and all right well maybe you have some

440
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,639
type of proxy or dns filtering in place

441
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,800
and so as you can see as you continue to

442
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,320
do this it just really turns into a

443
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,639
whack-a-mo type of approach so if you

444
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,560
really focus in on the top end of this

445
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,279
around ttps the tactics techniques and

446
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,920
procedures regardless of what domain

447
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,600
it's reaching out to your ip address

448
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
it's reaching out to if i'm looking for

449
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,880
very specific procedures and techniques

450
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,800
it really gives you a better detection

451
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,040
mechanism within your environment

452
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,120
so hopefully that makes sense like i

453
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,560
said this is you know really a lot of

454
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,720
the lead up pieces to this

455
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,000
um

456
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,399
so and now taking that so

457
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,000
using the moderate tax so one of the

458
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,360
things that we

459
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,560
like to do

460
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,320
at averting and helping our customers is

461
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,839
really help them get an understanding of

462
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,240
where they should look at right so

463
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,600
using miter attack using that maturity

464
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,279
matrix that we talked about earlier

465
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,880
right around cmm

466
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,600
is

467
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
where does a customer start out you know

468
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,240
it's like hey you know what are my

469
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,000
detection mechanisms you know a lot of

470
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,839
times when you're thinking about you

471
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,839
know you know attack

472
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,240
the attack framework and sim monitoring

473
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,680
a lot of that's very reactive and

474
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,800
detection

475
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,680
based and maybe start at the beginning

476
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,519
right it's like of these you know

477
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,279
hundreds and hundreds of techniques and

478
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,680
sub techniques which ones actually make

479
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,519
sense to in my environment so have an

480
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,000
initial risk score so go in and actually

481
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
identify which ones make sense to your

482
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,040
environment and then do some you know

483
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
kind of what are our protections there

484
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,839
are we able to prevent against those

485
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,000
particular attacks and those particular

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,920
techniques then we get into the

487
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
detection piece right how are we able to

488
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,240
detect that how are we able to do we

489
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,279
have rules in the sim do we have a sim

490
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,800
do we are even logging for that

491
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,480
particular technique so really getting

492
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,240
an understanding of what that detection

493
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,600
score looks like

494
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,360
and then finally how are you able to

495
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
respond do you have the appropriate

496
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,800
playbooks do you have the right

497
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,120
workflows do you know who to call who to

498
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,279
reach out to do you have the skill set

499
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,440
internally do you need to have a partner

500
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,000
or a dfr retainer with somebody that

501
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,919
come in and help when that incident

502
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:06,959
happens

503
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,959
and then finally how do i map that back

504
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,520
to a to like a threat intelligence group

505
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,319
if i know i'm in a certain industry um

506
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,760
you know or a certain

507
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,679
uh where or a certain part of the you

508
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,039
know the world you know if you work for

509
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,520
a very global you know a large global

510
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,359
organization there's certain threat

511
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,119
groups that you might you know need from

512
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,959
just like a geopolitical standpoint

513
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
right if you're working you know if

514
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,640
you're doing business in china you might

515
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,120
have things there or russia or europe or

516
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,720
whatever there's certain things that you

517
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,000
might need to think about from a threat

518
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
group's perspective and based on all

519
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
that information that can then give you

520
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,320
kind of a residuals risk score of where

521
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,080
i should be focusing

522
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,160
and then with that right this is where

523
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,320
you want to start your focus around you

524
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,679
know where you're doing your hunting

525
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,280
because then you're going to have you

526
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,679
know kind of leftover ttps that this is

527
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,240
where i need to focus because i i

528
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,640
definitely have some type of risk here

529
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,799
uh to be able to focus on in the future

530
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,679
so taking that step further now so that

531
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,280
was the lead in a little bit of history

532
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,039
uh let's say hopefully you know if you

533
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,640
read the abstract a lot of that you know

534
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,080
i wanted would just to be really just

535
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,559
introductory um and hopefully now i'm

536
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,080
gonna introduce you know some maybe

537
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,000
newer concepts if you're not using

538
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,520
notebooks or anything within your

539
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,400
organization today um and i know you

540
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,760
know uh ryan had mentioned you know

541
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,840
using like onenote uh you know jupiter

542
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,320
is almost like our onenote uh to an

543
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,720
extent it just really provides us you

544
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
know the more technical deep dives that

545
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,840
sometimes you can't do within a onenote

546
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,160
or you know a text document or something

547
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,600
like this it really builds some

548
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,240
interactive capabilities for when you

549
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,679
know you're trying to look and search

550
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,960
for things

551
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
so

552
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,919
the first thing when we're thinking

553
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,200
about this is you know when we're

554
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,039
building these notebooks is i really

555
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,200
want to kind of orientate you all into

556
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,960
kind of like building a pipeline and

557
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,160
having this very be a modular approach

558
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,280
and

559
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,679
and not only having these be something

560
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,720
that are consumed by your analyst team

561
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,280
or consumed by your engineering team

562
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,000
is if you build a modular approach to

563
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,559
these these are things that you can use

564
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,559
to help your team

565
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,400
go and ask for things within your

566
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,240
organization and those things usually

567
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,679
being technologies tools budget more

568
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,520
people or whatever so if you can come up

569
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,200
with you know using some type of

570
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,360
framework like this to where you can

571
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,200
share this with the executive team this

572
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,120
really helps you tell the story of what

573
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,160
you're doing day in and day out and so

574
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,840
why don't we make this stuff pretty you

575
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,760
know i think you know for us is you know

576
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,080
spending that extra little bit of time

577
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,480
really cleaning it up not just doing the

578
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,880
hunt within the sim and just leaving it

579
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,120
there and opening a ticket is can we

580
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,360
abstract that up an additional layer and

581
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,440
spend that extra 50

582
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,320
you know

583
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,200
effort to really turn this into a work

584
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,039
deliverable that can really help your

585
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,120
team within your organization or your

586
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,720
customers if you're actually a service

587
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,240
provider

588
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,679
so what does that look like you know so

589
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,280
within you know i just pulled a few of

590
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,640
these here you know within jupiter

591
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,880
there's a lot of a lot of great things

592
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,679
from like you know plotly and cuff links

593
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,000
and you know you can now embed dash and

594
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,080
do you know dashboarding and stuff

595
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,480
within jupiter notebooks and really

596
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,360
gives you a full indian way to represent

597
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,520
data within your environment

598
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,440
and what's really good about this

599
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,320
is the now you can start sending this up

600
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,280
within your organization and they can

601
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,720
actually look at this and be like all

602
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,320
right what am i getting out of this all

603
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,679
right you know i can see this

604
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,080
information this can be shared you know

605
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,240
laterally to your sis admins this could

606
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,720
be sent to your you know application

607
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,159
owners when you're doing those threat

608
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,159
hunts and it really gives them a visual

609
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,919
of what you were seeing when you were

610
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,679
doing those threat hunts

611
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,200
and the good thing about this right is

612
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,880
when you're starting to think about this

613
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,120
is now how do i relate this up you know

614
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,520
not just laterally within my environment

615
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,440
how do i look you know maybe up within

616
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,880
the organization

617
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,840
and so being able to relate this back to

618
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,280
the business is going to be something

619
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,600
that's you know really important right

620
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,400
so

621
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
the first the last slide really focused

622
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,360
on the tactical the technical right so

623
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,880
yes that's really good that's your

624
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
traditional threat hunt you know hey i

625
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
was looking for a certain ttp i was

626
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,520
sifting through some logs i saw that

627
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
this particular ip address was

628
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,520
performing some password spray attacks

629
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,440
or some brute forcing or you know

630
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,760
whatever that might be but what's the so

631
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,320
what well if you know you know like i

632
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,559
guess certain apt group that leverages

633
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,320
those techniques you know i have here an

634
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
example from a threat report that we did

635
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
earlier in the year and the reason i

636
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,440
chose this one is you know the dark side

637
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,600
of the colonial pipeline is you know

638
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,440
what's really good is is trying to

639
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,880
relate it to

640
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,360
you know your executives i i would think

641
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,480
you if you're especially in the

642
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,159
southeast right i think the colonial

643
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,720
pipeline that hit people at the pumps

644
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,200
right where gas prices went up and it

645
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,960
was one of those things where there was

646
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,200
you know worry if you know hey am i

647
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
going to have gas next week you know as

648
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,120
i'm driving to work or if hey i'm trying

649
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
to take my kids to soccer practice or

650
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,760
something so finding certain groups not

651
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,679
necessarily to make it you know scare

652
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,480
tactics but just to make it relatable so

653
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,960
that the executives can understand why

654
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
you're doing what you're doing as a

655
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,280
threat hunter is really important so be

656
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,360
able to tell that story you know look

657
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,480
for recent attacks that were you know

658
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,960
publicized within the media then go and

659
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
find which threat groups were the ones

660
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,600
behind that look and see what you know

661
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
attack you know techniques they were

662
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,280
using and then go look for those in your

663
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,679
environment that way you can then relate

664
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,919
that and tell a better story and then

665
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,000
when you're telling that story

666
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,799
executives they speak in dollars right

667
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,720
so be able to look at hey what's the

668
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
average ransom demand what's business

669
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,280
downtime what does that look like from a

670
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,679
business risk and reputation standpoint

671
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,840
so really being able to relate that back

672
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,080
to the business is really key when

673
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,520
you're building this

674
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,039
so i'm going to show you here on the

675
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,960
next slide just a quick format of what

676
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,640
this is but this is just hopefully gets

677
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
you thinking around all right when i'm

678
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,679
writing

679
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,080
my hypothesis to go do a threat hunt

680
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
that i'm not just writing this one-liner

681
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,880
i'm not just writing this one little you

682
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,960
know detector or analytic or whatever

683
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,720
you call your particular

684
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,120
you know hypothesis that you know

685
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,760
there's a reason behind this and then

686
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,840
being able to then relate that up to the

687
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,360
business

688
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,720
so

689
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,919
going in is like how do we

690
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,440
operationalize this you know i think you

691
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,799
know that's well and good right i think

692
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,240
you know we would love to be able to do

693
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,320
that but here's just a quick little

694
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,640
framework and you can take this ad to

695
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,400
this this is you know i try to simplify

696
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
it as much as possible you know for the

697
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,559
audience today um and i know you know

698
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,840
going back to earlier not every

699
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,440
organization is going to have a full

700
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
team dedicated to to be able to do this

701
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,000
you know you know for us you know this

702
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,520
is what we do from a day-to-day basis

703
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,960
you know our cyber threat intelligence

704
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,480
team we have different people that work

705
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,320
on different parts of this you know we

706
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,559
have technical writers you know we have

707
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,919
people that can actually write the

708
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,159
analytics and and really build these

709
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,720
polished things so i get it you know

710
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,559
this can you know can be a lot but you

711
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,320
know hopefully just gives you you know

712
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,240
some concepts to think about is if there

713
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,320
is that one that pops up sometimes and

714
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,159
be like you know what i remember what

715
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,000
nick said at you know besides greenville

716
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,159
this would be a perfect opportunity to

717
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,799
not let me just stop at this individ

718
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,360
individualized threat hunt let me take

719
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,440
this put this into a report because i

720
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,520
know my boss or my boss's boss could

721
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,480
then leverage this to then go to the the

722
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,600
cfo to help supplement and help me

723
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
buy that new edr solution that i was

724
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,159
wanting or help me you know get that sim

725
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,840
i've been asking for for the past three

726
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,240
years or whatever that might be so

727
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,600
hopefully this just gives you some

728
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,440
things to think about

729
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,600
so starting at the top right and this is

730
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,120
you know pretty straightforward uh

731
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,919
document info uh nothing groundbreaking

732
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,480
here right so just you know what are we

733
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,840
talking about here you know day of the

734
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,240
report you know who prepared it you know

735
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,320
did we do the hunt you know this is

736
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,480
really thinking about a modular threat

737
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,720
intelligence report so you can start

738
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
with hey did we do a hunt what was the

739
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,880
objective of this what was the abstract

740
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,360
if you do tlps you know a traffic light

741
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
um protocol and right you know is this

742
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,200
is this you know sensitive to us only

743
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,720
can this be shared you know you can put

744
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,320
a lot of different things that go into

745
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,799
that that document info you know one of

746
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,400
the things we like to use a lot of times

747
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,120
is the data being used right is there

748
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,640
you know as you're trying to share this

749
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,960
maybe to your you know maybe you have a

750
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,200
work group or some discord that you work

751
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,840
with people on on the outside or

752
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,600
you know just some friends of yours you

753
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,279
want to share this report too is you

754
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,559
know what are they looking for when

755
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,840
they're doing that

756
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,679
um the next section is really around the

757
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,080
thread info right so that summary so we

758
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,520
talked about that slide earlier around

759
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,039
dark side is you know what are we

760
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,400
talking about what tactics and

761
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,880
techniques did darkseid use as part of

762
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,960
that you know any recommendations that

763
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,600
you can make the references you know

764
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,799
really do a really good job of laying

765
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,039
out what that threat actor or whatever

766
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,240
they were doing

767
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,840
and then the final piece is the actual

768
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,080
hunt data so once you've you know kind

769
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,840
of laid this out you have your document

770
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,440
info you have a really good narrative

771
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,360
right explaining what you're looking for

772
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,440
and why it's important this is where you

773
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,440
can start getting into building the hunt

774
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,240
pieces is this having a notebook that

775
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,919
you can actually go in and do an actual

776
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,360
threat hunt against you know this is for

777
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,440
somebody that maybe you're an instant

778
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,600
responder maybe you don't you know maybe

779
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
you are a you know security admin and

780
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,600
you don't have a sim and you just have

781
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,320
maybe a syslog server you're just maybe

782
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,240
you just have logs sitting on systems

783
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,080
and you have to go run scripts to go do

784
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,919
these grabs and do this you know

785
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,360
whatever that is you know there's ways

786
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
of doing that and

787
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,279
really mapping that out from what data

788
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,200
fields do i need what technology do i

789
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,679
need to use are there certain api hooks

790
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,679
that i need to pull into maybe i'm in

791
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,559
aws and i need to go out and you know do

792
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,200
pools and maybe store information within

793
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
s3 buckets and be able to do flat file

794
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,440
analysis or or whatever that might look

795
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,360
like and then be able to pull all that

796
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,039
data together correlate it together and

797
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,799
then be able to do metrics and reporting

798
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,799
against that

799
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,400
so what does that look in practice so

800
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,159
here's just you know quick examples

801
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,720
right so you know having a report data

802
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,559
making sure who the audience is you know

803
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,320
that's really important you know if

804
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,919
you're doing a threat intelligence

805
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,520
report and

806
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,760
it's you know really focused around you

807
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,919
know just maybe be informative to the

808
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,440
executives maybe you don't have the

809
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,520
threat hunt step at the bottom you can

810
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
still write these threat reports and

811
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,360
have this same type of structure and

812
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,799
kind of give that objective you know

813
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,320
what you're looking for what the data is

814
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,600
required

815
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,039
and then here's you know what we were

816
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,320
talking about earlier right so here's

817
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,640
that information around the example

818
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,880
here's you know a quick screenshot

819
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,039
here's some references and executives

820
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,360
love this stuff they talk you know

821
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,200
security used to be one of those things

822
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,679
where most the time you know it was it

823
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,360
was you know one of these things that it

824
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,200
was a cost center but more and more

825
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
organizations are starting to see where

826
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,039
security is helping you know it's almost

827
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,039
like your insurance policy it's keeping

828
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,600
them out of the the news it's helping

829
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,480
the business up and running and they use

830
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,720
this as a way to talk to their you know

831
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,080
fellow friends like they're ceo ceos all

832
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,840
the time that when we share these

833
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,679
documents they're sharing it with their

834
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,320
fellow ceos and we get calls you know

835
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,640
wanting this same type of stuff so you

836
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,000
know a lot of cool things that you can

837
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,360
do here

838
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,760
so going a little deeper right so just

839
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,880
giving you some kind of you know what

840
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,720
does that document look like you know

841
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
what were the important pieces what are

842
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,880
the recommendations what were those

843
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,520
minor attack mappings back to that and

844
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,120
really giving you a sense of you know

845
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,840
what was the attack actor doing

846
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,440
so now examples of you know what does

847
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,039
that threat hunt look like you know so

848
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,320
you know we mentioned earlier around you

849
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,399
know you know threat hunting um you know

850
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,240
it's like within jupiter there's a lot

851
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,559
of capabilities here you know you can do

852
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,320
a lot of this in onenote you can do a

853
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,559
lot of this in word or

854
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,559
you know insert your favorite text

855
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,000
editor

856
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
but within jupiter the reason we like

857
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,360
that is when we're writing these

858
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,039
narratives and writing these within a

859
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,320
notebook is we're not just setting there

860
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,080
you can actually go and take action on

861
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,520
that so you can write embedded you know

862
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,760
python commands and searches and stuff

863
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,880
here where you can do ml ai models you

864
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,000
can go and search and do parsing of logs

865
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,840
you know using data frames to be able to

866
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,679
go out and do the searching and stuff

867
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,960
this is definitely not meant to be a

868
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,200
deep dive in the jupiter notebooks and

869
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,720
and you know data science and all of

870
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,640
that but there's a lot of cool things

871
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,320
that you can do within these to be able

872
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,480
to do those thread hunts and this i

873
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,000
think is even more important you know

874
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,720
for

875
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
people that maybe don't have a sim or

876
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
maybe you're an instant responders these

877
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,320
make really good instant response

878
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,559
playbooks to where maybe you have

879
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,600
different

880
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,080
you know playbooks based on if i'm doing

881
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,399
an investigation on a windows machine or

882
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,080
if i'm doing an investigation on a linux

883
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,200
box or maybe i'm looking at a

884
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,720
you know an application you know maybe

885
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,080
one of your applications are beginning

886
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,840
to hit really hard and you're trying to

887
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,080
figure out you know who's the you know

888
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,159
ip address are they what kind of attacks

889
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,520
have they been doing so you can build a

890
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,840
lot of custom parsers a lot of different

891
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,559
things here to do those detections

892
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,159
and here's an example right of the you

893
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,399
know here's a some apache logs right so

894
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,679
being able to

895
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,159
go in and doing that deep dive around

896
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,120
hey

897
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
parsing that you know trying to find

898
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
those user agent strings or who the

899
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,960
referrer was or who are those remote

900
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,399
hosts and you can really build those

901
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,399
graphs out to be able to do that threat

902
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,880
hunt directly from this notebook so just

903
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,640
like you would type in a word document

904
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,480
or just like you would type in any other

905
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
text editor you're writing these but

906
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,240
then you're also within the same

907
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,640
document writing the raw code to be able

908
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,880
to go and do those threat hunts for this

909
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,360
particular information

910
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,600
and so to wrap it up uh because i want

911
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,799
to leave some time here at the end for

912
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,320
some questions so

913
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,000
this is where you can really work on you

914
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,559
know you know building that pipeline so

915
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,640
you saw that kind of modular approach

916
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,320
and like i said you know not every

917
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,640
organization is going to have this um

918
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,840
but you know sometimes you don't have to

919
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,440
do this all the time right i mean if

920
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,919
you're that one guy that does security

921
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,159
use this as just a tool maybe every once

922
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,919
in a while to be able to tell a story

923
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,440
that you're trying to tell

924
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,399
so

925
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,240
what does that pipeline look right look

926
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,080
like you know starting at the bottom

927
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,000
right if you have an intelligence team

928
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
you know they identify that threat maybe

929
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,159
you see it on twitter maybe you see it

930
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,240
in some email that you're subscribed to

931
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,080
from uh you know just uh you know some

932
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,399
type of threat intelligence source is

933
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,240
then you can create that threat report

934
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
start at the top level you know think of

935
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,480
the business risk tell that story of

936
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
what's important there then you can

937
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,960
start building that technical hunt using

938
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,880
notebooks if you want to

939
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,799
you you can still use your normal tools

940
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,000
this is just trying to introduce you

941
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
know kind of maybe a new concept you

942
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,840
know go and then start looking at your

943
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
sim looking at your edr looking at your

944
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,399
firewalls looking at your ids ips

945
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,919
whatever tooling that you might have

946
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,000
there and really building those pieces

947
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,640
out and then be able to take that report

948
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,960
bundle all that up together and then

949
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,039
once you do that hunt put the evidence

950
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,360
of what you found there right show put

951
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,120
those in tables you know put that in an

952
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,039
appendix you know maybe the executives

953
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,039
don't care but as it moves up to the

954
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,760
organization you know they can scroll or

955
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,919
go as deep as they want to right you

956
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,200
know and be able to do that and

957
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,799
ultimately just be able to show value

958
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,960
within the organization so

959
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,799
let your threat intelligence team let

960
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,880
your threat hunters now be

961
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,120
somebody that the organization sees as

962
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,440
an important piece of the organization

963
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,279
not some hackers that are sitting in the

964
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,440
basement what was the old quote the 600

965
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,039
pound hacker right that lives in their

966
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,519
mom basement we don't we all know we're

967
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,120
not that right so if you're from a

968
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,720
threat hunter you like doing opera you

969
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,120
know like doing the blue team stuff is

970
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,440
try to be you know show your value

971
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,159
within the organization right um

972
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,159
and and make you raise your hand and be

973
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,559
able to to be able to do those things so

974
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,159
i think i'm coming up at least about

975
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,960
like five minutes here so um

976
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,960
i appreciate it uh appreciate the time

977
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,200
today hope you all learned some new

978
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
things here um

979
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,559
and i will open this up to questions
