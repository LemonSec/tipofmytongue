here hey everybody welcome to besides

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,200
greenville 2021 super happy to be

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,960
presenting to you today can everyone see

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,400
this slide that i'm sharing and

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,920
presenting sharing my screen out can i

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,520
get a

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,199
thumbs up or a hey

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,840
yes we can see it thanks hilary good to

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,680
see you hey you as well i'm glad you're

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,840
here it's it's exciting to be here for

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
besides greenville even if it's virtual

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,519
uh gathering together with the infosec

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,079
community is always so much fun

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,440
today we're going to be talking about in

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
this session specifically about report

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,440
writing in the context of doing

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,280
penetration tests

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,960
or even training engagements that we

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
might do including like certification

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,039
exams so the title of my presentation is

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,120
streamlining the report writing process

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,360
with auto report an auto report is a

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,440
tool that i wrote to fill in some of the

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,280
gaps that i've experienced both within

26
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,000
my own workflow when it comes to doing

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,320
security reviews and assessments and

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,199
also

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,320
some of the

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,960
confusing information that i've gathered

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,479
over time i don't know if it's going to

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,760
speak to your use case as well but

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,200
i'm thinking that it's going to so i'd

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,360
like to present that to you today

35
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,560
uh real quick who i am

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,400
uh for those of you who haven't attended

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,040
an official besides in person enjoy this

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,600
nice slide of what happened in 2019 i

39
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,200
get a feel for that community aspect i

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,119
think we're all missing that community

41
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,200
aspect of information security at these

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,720
conferences and it's been a pretty

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
amazing run for the last few months i

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,799
mean august we had defcon 29 and then

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,600
recently b-side charlotte augusta and

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,280
then you got the capstone of b-sides

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
greenville so it's always good to have

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,759
our local community here my name is ben

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,320
acord but i go by overcast on the defcon

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,880
discords and typically anything inside

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,240
of the defcon

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,280
uh

53
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,439
umbrella for the defcon group i go by

54
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,560
overcast so i answer to both it's not my

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,880
the name my parents gave me but i make

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
them call me that anyway

57
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,360
i work at floor uh primarily with mark

58
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,040
funderberg we work in mission solutions

59
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,680
where we deliver successful solutions to

60
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,439
our government clients

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,959
but i'm also one of the co-founders of

62
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,440
the local defcon 864 group here in the

63
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
upstate which is just a collection of

64
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,080
anybody who wants to come and share in

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,640
that amazing ability to to communicate

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,800
what what i'm learning and then learn

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
from each other so

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,040
that's that's one of my passions is to

69
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,200
actually be able to give back to those

70
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,080
who are

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,720
in that same community and recently i've

72
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,319
also started teaching at greenville

73
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,239
technical college i noticed some of my

74
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,080
students have shown up in the our former

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
students have shown up in the in the

76
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,200
session so it's good to see you guys

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
there

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,319
and i teach the penetration testing one

79
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,160
class over at greenville tech

80
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,519
and that's the main focus for this this

81
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,720
talk

82
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,480
is around penetration testing in fact

83
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,280
the actual code for auto report came

84
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,840
from a failure a personal failure of my

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,920
own in may i sat for the offensive

86
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,480
security certified professional exam

87
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,800
and the next morning as i sat with a

88
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,120
coffee cup in hand and a notepad and

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
doing my lessons learned

90
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
i realized that there were some pretty

91
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,680
big gaps in my workflow um and some

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,519
things that it cost me a lot of time and

93
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,239
actually i'm not blaming the tools i am

94
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,640
blaming my own workflow but i realized

95
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,800
that that those gaps led to the

96
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,120
smoldering rune that was the failure

97
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
email that came into my inbox that day

98
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,159
so what i'd like to do is walk through

99
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,480
how i realized that those gaps exist

100
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,879
so let's take a look quickly briefly at

101
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,519
what the penetration testing methodology

102
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,080
is it's this layered approach and we

103
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,640
love layers or diagrams or triangles or

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,799
venn diagrams to explain things in

105
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,640
information security i mean we can't

106
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
talk about confidentiality integrity or

107
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,080
availability without some kind of a

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
triangle

109
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
diagram of sorts but in this case we're

110
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
looking here at the very bottom layer

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,200
we're doing that planning and scoping of

112
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,040
the engagement getting the rules of the

113
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,360
road so to speak and then we're moving

114
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,200
into that open source intelligence and

115
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,680
information gathering phase

116
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
collecting vulnerabilities and doing

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,959
that active reconnaissance attacking and

118
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,480
exploitation and then at the very top

119
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,279
i'm combining two tiers into one here

120
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,358
we have reporting reporting is the last

121
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,279
thing that's done but out of everything

122
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,919
in this cake this layered approach it's

123
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,479
the most important if a company engages

124
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,120
us to do a penetration test or security

125
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,280
review they don't want us just to go and

126
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
do it they actually want to be able to

127
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,199
receive results

128
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,479
that they can tangibly hold and act upon

129
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,120
and that's where the report comes in

130
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,360
unfortunately during this process it's

131
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,680
not sheets and ladders or a board game

132
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,000
where you're only ever in a single state

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
at any given time you're often required

134
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
to

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,199
multi-thread task an action where you're

136
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
doing some work on a vulnerability while

137
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,759
thinking forward into either a chained

138
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,479
exploit process to gain the shell or

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,960
whatever else you're looking at there so

140
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
if i could take this image and maybe

141
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,759
just swirl the cake a little bit

142
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,280
that's typically what it may look like

143
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,440
during the process whereas reporting at

144
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,039
the very end is you're taking all the

145
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,639
results you've collected

146
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,800
all those notes you've accumulated over

147
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,120
that penetration test and you're boiling

148
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,680
them into an official report a slide

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,919
deck something that the customer can

150
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,039
hold

151
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,280
and act on

152
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,199
but when it comes to guidance for how we

153
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,199
write that report

154
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,600
it's kind of a hot mess we have some

155
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
official bodies who have released some

156
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,280
guidance on this topic and depending

157
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
upon the industry vertical you're in for

158
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
example if you're in fintech

159
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,840
pci is your go-to

160
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,600
if you're in the government space like i

161
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
am nist is the body that you look

162
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,680
almost every day and so when it comes to

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,880
for example nist special publication

164
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,520
800-115

165
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
their reporting section in that document

166
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,600
is literally two paragraphs long and

167
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,120
most of that is bullet points i can

168
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,960
summarize it for you very simply you

169
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,039
should write a report it should contain

170
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,960
results and you need to provide it to

171
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,639
someone who asked for it

172
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,880
that's the bulk of what 800 115 says

173
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,120
about reporting and then there's other

174
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
optional bodies that have produced some

175
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,680
pretty helpful information on report

176
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,039
writing

177
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,880
a few of them have gone so far for

178
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
example like the penetration testing

179
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,520
execution standard have given

180
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,240
headings and subheadings and content

181
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,919
descriptions for what should be

182
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,000
contained in that report that that will

183
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
aid you in the report writing process

184
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
and as you can see from the

185
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,400
vulnerability assessment dot co dot uk

186
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,240
which just flows off the tongue

187
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,840
they've done the same thing where

188
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,919
they're brought blocking out what that

189
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,919
report template should look like

190
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,919
but as someone who's either new to the

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,160
industry or working for a company that

192
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,759
now wants to start doing security

193
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,000
assessments or penetration tests

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,919
which one of these do i pick

195
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,280
do i have to review all of them and

196
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,960
merge them into something that i can act

197
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,680
on

198
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
and that's an open question here so we

199
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,960
look to further guidance out into the

200
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,120
industry and we do have some amazing

201
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,280
blog posts or

202
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,199
companies who are tried and true pen

203
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,720
test companies they're doing this every

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
single day and so we can glean a lot of

205
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
wisdom from what they've put together

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,400
and offered online

207
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
but we're hoping that they've you know

208
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
included some of the secret sauce to

209
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,080
make it all come together and uh and

210
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,800
help us in that report writing effort

211
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
in the example of like a a testing body

212
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,039
like offensive security they've given us

213
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,360
a a template to use for the report

214
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
writing um and you can see that in the

215
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,440
top right there from mega corp one but

216
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,199
there's a really interesting statement

217
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
when you review the penetration testing

218
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,960
or the pen 200 course it used to be

219
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,400
called the pwk

220
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,280
now it's pen 200 in that

221
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,720
section

222
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,639
that first paragraph it says that every

223
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,560
penetration tester will have their own

224
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,879
style and preference of workflow and

225
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,440
documentation and that's pretty much the

226
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,199
standard approach you hear across the

227
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,680
industry is it's personal it's up to you

228
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,440
you can take notes you can document any

229
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,319
way you want to just you know do it well

230
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,919
enough that you can produce a report at

231
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,840
the

232
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,599
end and if we look to a broader scope

233
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,039
today if i want to find something

234
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,560
quickly and know how to do something i'm

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,840
going to look on youtube and see

236
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,720
somebody show me how it's done and we

237
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,800
have some amazing you know thought

238
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,199
leaders now that are putting out onto

239
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,759
youtube examples of how they conduct

240
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,680
their workflow how they document it if

241
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,080
you've ever watched an ipsec video

242
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,159
he's monologuing it's almost like a

243
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,479
stream of consciousness for his entire

244
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,479
workflow through an engagement it's very

245
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,080
impressive

246
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,919
john hammond's been really upfront with

247
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,000
how he takes notes and resources the

248
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
cyber mentor and in fact tcm security in

249
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
their course for the pnpt exam is one of

250
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,279
the first cases along with ine where

251
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,200
there's a dedicated training module for

252
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,839
how to take notes during the exam and

253
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,440
where note taking and report writing

254
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,920
aren't left just at the very end because

255
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,080
if you wait to the end it's too late you

256
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
may have forgotten something and you may

257
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,839
not have access back into the company to

258
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,160
do it

259
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
so if we take all of those options and

260
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,240
we gather them together we're left with

261
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
you know ipsec's tool set we're left

262
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,399
with john hammond's tool set trusted set

263
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
gave some examples well if i've gathered

264
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,880
all of that guidance together all that

265
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
wisdom and i keep testing and trying it

266
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,839
out

267
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,360
which is the case that i've got here

268
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,600
i've got a file system that's littered

269
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
with examples where i've tried one

270
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
person's way of doing documentation and

271
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,839
report writing and then i move on to try

272
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,360
someone else's because i'm trying to

273
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,800
find efficiencies i'm trying to find

274
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,160
something that's really going to help me

275
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,519
get through

276
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,680
that finish line well

277
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
so i've got this huge collection of

278
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,760
tools i've got a huge collection of

279
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,440
scattered documentation around on my

280
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
file system and even within kali linux

281
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,320
we have tools that are included

282
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,720
but you either quickly hit a paywall or

283
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,279
you have limited functionality

284
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,720
so what i

285
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,560
wound up doing

286
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,320
when i sat for the offensive security

287
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,720
certified professional exam is if the

288
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,560
penetration testing methodology was a

289
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,040
layered cake all of my little

290
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,560
tips and tricks that i gathered for

291
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,000
note-taking were kind of like a bunch of

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,320
little candies jammed into this cake

293
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,279
baking process and really didn't fit

294
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,040
what i was trying to accomplish just

295
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,320
trying to if i'm trying to make a cake

296
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
and honestly this analogy is breaking

297
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,040
down really quickly i don't know how far

298
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,279
i can run with it

299
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,760
and this is a an image heavy slide deck

300
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,640
apologies in advance halfway through

301
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,440
but what i really needed my notes to be

302
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,640
is that icing the icing of the report

303
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,800
around the overall cake

304
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,720
really comes from the locking in of the

305
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,800
icing in between the layers

306
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,040
as each layer is formed and established

307
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,480
with the one above it

308
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,720
my notes solidify

309
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
that bridge between the two and

310
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,800
ultimately i'm able to produce a solid

311
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,480
report at the end because i have a

312
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,240
consistent flow between them i don't

313
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,920
have like a gummy bear and a skittle and

314
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,800
other

315
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,040
brands between them

316
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,120
so what if i built upon what works and

317
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,440
this is what i had i had a notepad with

318
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,800
me while i was drinking my coffee and

319
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,880
the smoldering embers of my oscp and i

320
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,560
was making notes about lessons learned

321
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,480
what could i prove on and i thought i

322
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,440
really love auto recon it's a great tool

323
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,360
to do that initial

324
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,240
uh overview of a large list of systems

325
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
that you have their ip addresses and it

326
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
has a directory structure

327
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
okay i can work with that right you know

328
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,320
that's a good starting point and then at

329
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,959
the very end i came across a product by

330
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,640
someone named no raj on github and they

331
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,880
take notes in markdown with predefined

332
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,200
templates and then you run this ruby

333
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
script and it produces the pdf output of

334
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,120
your report

335
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,880
that was really helpful for the oscp

336
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,120
exam because you have to submit a pdf

337
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,279
included in a 7-zip archive

338
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,519
okay so i've got something during my

339
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,120
engagement and i've got something at the

340
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,959
end of my engagement but you'll notice

341
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,040
there's white space before

342
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,079
between

343
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,880
and after that process

344
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
and so i started writing and documenting

345
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
what would go around those two what

346
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,639
would go around that

347
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,120
how could i enhance that options yet

348
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,320
build upon what they have

349
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,560
and that's what led to auto report and

350
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,959
that is a really bold orange so what i'm

351
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,360
going to do now is i'm going to stop

352
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,760
this presentation and slide deck and

353
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,360
we're going to go straight to a live

354
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
demo because if there's one thing i love

355
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
to do at b-sides i did it in 2019 it's

356
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,160
running live code

357
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,920
all right so there's two tools that i've

358
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,079
added in here and only two tools the

359
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,560
first is obsidian it's a markdown editor

360
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,320
that lets you switch between the edit

361
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,800
view and the actual display view of

362
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,920
markdown you know that rich html like

363
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
view and display

364
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,680
and then the other pieces i have

365
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,399
incorporated no raj's offensive security

366
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,560
markdown templates those are all built

367
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,480
into this tool

368
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,120
so let's see here i'm going to go over

369
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,040
and there are five use cases that we're

370
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,279
going to walk through in this example

371
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,480
and the first one is going to be

372
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,160
training

373
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,600
auto report

374
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,800
and

375
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,279
first let me show you an example

376
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,680
of why i'm going to be using a shortcut

377
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,839
auto report on my system right now

378
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,040
is a symbolic link over to opt auto

379
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
report which is where i've done the

380
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,360
github clone to a local instance so now

381
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,040
whenever i run auto report just know

382
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
it's really calling that python script

383
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,680
in opt

384
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,000
auto report has a wonderful classic menu

385
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
system you don't have to use it for

386
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,800
everything

387
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,320
but it's here to guide you along the way

388
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
if you'd like to so i'm going to use

389
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,440
startup

390
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,600
i'm selecting a training effort because

391
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,199
today i woke up and i decided i wanted

392
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,320
to do a little bit of training to get

393
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
ready for my next exam attempt

394
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,480
and in this case we're going to do a

395
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,399
vuln hub machine

396
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,320
we're going to do metasploitable 2.

397
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,000
and i do know the ip address

398
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,320
and the output for this this is on for

399
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,399
my own efforts in fact my instructor

400
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,399
wants me to

401
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,480
submit it through the greenville tech

402
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,839
system so i'm going to submit it as a

403
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,040
document file a libreoffice document or

404
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,839
a not so libreoffice document and behind

405
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,760
the scenes what auto report does is it

406
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,160
creates a directory structure for us in

407
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
a consistent fashion and it preloads a

408
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,639
bunch of templates for us that we can

409
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,000
then

410
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,480
go and use now

411
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,040
i you notice i'm i'm not sitting in any

412
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,519
real directory to use that right now

413
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,800
but i can

414
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,199
navigate into that directory and take a

415
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,800
look at the files that are there

416
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,079
but i can also take a look

417
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,959
in my obsidian and notice that it's

418
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,279
already loaded everything that's on the

419
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,959
file system because these are just

420
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,800
markdown files i already have a targets

421
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
file that i can use

422
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,320
and my next step here is and i'm going

423
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
to introduce you to another feature

424
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,839
called the situation report

425
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,480
where i'm just going to say

426
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
what are the what are my thoughts and

427
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
the situation report is

428
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,040
a log of your thought processes as

429
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,800
you're moving through a pen test and

430
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,519
what's happening behind the scenes is

431
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,000
auto report is time stamping that into a

432
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,920
file that you can then review at a later

433
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,600
time so you'll notice that it logs both

434
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,320
its activities as well as your own and

435
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,560
the value for this is if i get down a

436
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,480
rabbit trail and i realize i may be on a

437
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,399
rabbit trail maybe i can't really

438
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,360
exploit that mysql database

439
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
well i want to look back and say what

440
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,120
was i doing 45 minutes ago

441
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,519
before i got on this rabbit trail i just

442
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
look at the situation report and if i've

443
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
been good about putting in my entries

444
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,880
i'll know immediately where i got

445
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,800
sidetracked

446
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,360
i can also look at the situation report

447
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
on the command line

448
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,560
because if i don't have to leave the

449
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,079
keyboard if i don't have to leave the

450
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,600
terminal

451
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,279
then i'm being more efficient so i'm

452
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,120
able to update my note taking through

453
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,519
sitrep while actively maintaining my

454
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,800
engagement

455
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,639
against the target

456
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,320
so at this point now obviously we would

457
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,279
run auto recon minus t

458
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,759
and the target stop markdown file that

459
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,079
will take 16 minutes to run against this

460
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,040
target

461
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,519
so what i'm going to do

462
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,839
is i'm going to preload

463
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,320
what i have already done before i've

464
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,800
already run auto recon before and i've

465
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,120
loaded these results here

466
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,639
pretty common we're all used to auto

467
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,399
recon in the directory structure that

468
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,160
just directory structure that it loads

469
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,959
it has its own report directory but

470
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,160
we're not going to use that

471
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,639
because we have our own report directory

472
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,959
structure up here now as i'm going

473
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,680
through my engagement i have a template

474
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,400
already defined for me in markdown that

475
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,319
has some latex header information if you

476
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,599
don't know what latex is don't worry

477
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,679
that's just a way of helping to convert

478
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,679
to other file formats

479
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,919
and it's pre-stubbed with information

480
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,520
about

481
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,079
basically it's an easy way to can your

482
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,679
write-up for your blog post your

483
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,919
linkedin post however you want to put

484
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,039
this out

485
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,119
after the fact remember we never just

486
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,799
want to

487
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,400
retain information that we're learning

488
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,919
and training on we want to be able to

489
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,160
give that back to others part of the

490
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,320
reason why i'm speaking now

491
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,880
you'll notice that there are boilerplate

492
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,720
variables included in the document when

493
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,640
you go to create the final report which

494
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,840
is automated

495
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,919
auto report replaces these out with

496
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,160
specific variables for your engagement

497
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,480
so i'm going to come down here now let's

498
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,600
take a look at what we've got

499
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,559
next step that i want to do

500
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,200
i'm going to take a look at the ports

501
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,880
so auto

502
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,919
report has a

503
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,720
feature that will actually look for

504
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,440
common nmap output file names and show

505
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,679
you the results for each target that it

506
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,039
finds

507
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,200
what it does behind the scenes and i

508
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,320
need to open the folder here

509
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,240
is it creates an excel file one of the

510
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,440
things that one of the penetration

511
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,240
testers in defcon 864 recommended when i

512
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,760
was explaining what what tool i was

513
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,200
building he said i like providing my

514
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,120
clients with an excel document of all

515
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,360
the port services and versions for every

516
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,640
ip address

517
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,960
and so you have here a worksheet tab for

518
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,000
each ip as well as an all ports tab that

519
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,760
lists every host and all the ports that

520
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,640
were collected there

521
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,280
and that's separate

522
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,640
now

523
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,559
because we know

524
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,520
metasploitable 2 we also know that we

525
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
have a bind shell that's already

526
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,720
existing for us so we're going to test

527
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,320
this vulnerability

528
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,400
to see if we can confirm it and sure

529
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,440
enough we do get

530
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,480
a root shell i'm going to use flame shot

531
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,880
which is a tool that i highly recommend

532
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,039
for screen shotting

533
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,760
and i'm going to

534
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,160
take a screenshot

535
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,440
to save as evidence

536
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,280
documents auto report training

537
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,520
vulnerable metasploitable to report

538
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,600
images and we're going to call this 1524

539
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
and that's all i'm going to call it

540
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,480
and now i can come over into the report

541
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,559
and say this is a critical vulnerability

542
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,240
and i can start writing my documentation

543
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,160
for this right here and we're going to

544
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,640
use the standard markdown

545
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,600
formatting for

546
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,439
or putting in our images

547
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,559
before png and depending upon the type

548
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,559
of format that you write in you can even

549
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,840
do some

550
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,679
css

551
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,840
to increase the size of the the image

552
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,039
i'm just going to leave it as it is for

553
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,440
right now

554
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,760
so there's the image and we don't have

555
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
to remember to click save or anything

556
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,840
like that it's automatically being done

557
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,440
for us

558
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,200
but because i've now validated a

559
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,039
vulnerability and i've logged its

560
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,280
evidence both saved it to disk and

561
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,960
written it into my report now i want to

562
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,840
go back and actually

563
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,919
log that vulnerability

564
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,960
with auto report

565
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,600
and if i do listing there's zero

566
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,440
vulnerabilities currently listed so i'm

567
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,400
going to add one pick my target the port

568
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,559
number is 15 24

569
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,240
and for this one it's going to just be

570
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,000
buy and shell

571
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,840
the business impact here i can put a

572
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,320
likelihood

573
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,159
let's say 90

574
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,400
i could even if i if it reveals company

575
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,200
sensitive data i can list that here as

576
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,880
the indicator there remediation

577
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,000
um pick up where i left off

578
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,080
after collecting the metadata about the

579
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,159
vulnerability we're prompted to add a

580
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,720
cvss level three

581
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,440
um score and if you know it right here

582
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,799
like the number i'm just going to say

583
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,480
nine

584
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,960
i can just enter it here and it it

585
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,280
collects it for me if i said no to do if

586
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
i know the cvss score it will walk me

587
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,000
through every prompt to calculate and

588
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,159
build that string for the vector and

589
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,760
that's logged with your vulnerability as

590
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,559
well

591
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,559
and then it moves on to prompting us for

592
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,080
the miter attack framework we're going

593
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,320
to pick the the tactic and then we're

594
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,159
going to pick the technique in this case

595
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,760
i'm simply saying it's in initial access

596
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,919
of a exploit of a publicly facing

597
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,320
application it prompts me to confirm

598
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
that my values that i entered and when i

599
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,520
say yes

600
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,880
we now have

601
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,520
a listing of a vulnerability again

602
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,880
that's written out

603
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,360
on disk as its own

604
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,799
spreadsheet and that's going to get

605
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,559
merged later on into your final report

606
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,039
so let's

607
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,559
let's pretend we finish this full

608
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,559
engagement we are done we are ready to

609
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,640
move on to the next thing and so what

610
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,799
i'm going to do is i'm going to run auto

611
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,320
report finalize

612
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,640
and that's it your report is done now if

613
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,880
i had completed everything in my

614
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,919
markdown file here obviously this report

615
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,159
would be much more thorough and complete

616
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,559
but as you can see there's now a docx

617
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,600
file for a not so libreoffice

618
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,760
uh file format and it's created the

619
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,280
document for us

620
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,799
for whatever reason i haven't figured

621
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,720
this out yet it doesn't automatically

622
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,840
update the table of contents

623
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,520
and you can see as we scroll through

624
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,120
some of the tables get messed up here a

625
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,039
little bit but

626
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,640
it has the screenshot and the

627
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,559
information that we had keyed in

628
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,240
for this vulnerability and exploit

629
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,280
all right so that's the first example is

630
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,799
training now what if we decide we're

631
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,080
going to move on we're going to do some

632
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,039
more training

633
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,039
but this time we're going to go for

634
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,960
something big we've we've got a training

635
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,080
budget we're going to go for an

636
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,640
offensive security pen 200 course we're

637
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,799
going to sign up for and start the lab

638
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,440
they require a pdf and a 7-zip so i'm

639
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,760
picking that and you'll notice the

640
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,000
directory structure is the exact same i

641
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,840
don't have to worry about wait did i did

642
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,480
i log all my documentation in documents

643
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,080
or was i working out of a different file

644
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,480
system

645
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,200
to use this

646
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
it's consistent it's consistently always

647
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,120
in your home directory documents auto

648
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,799
report and the markdown files are if you

649
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,039
if you leave obsidian open it

650
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,880
automatically recognizes that you've put

651
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,679
new files on the file system ready to go

652
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,360
and i can just jump right in and start

653
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,120
working either on machines

654
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,679
or here we have the exam report this is

655
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,240
the exact template that offensive

656
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,799
security released in a odt and docx

657
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,039
format that we used to work in but now

658
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,000
it's marked down thanks to nora no raj

659
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,679
i've just broken these out into

660
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,679
individual machine names that you need

661
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,960
to record

662
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
for logging one other item that i want

663
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,559
to point out here is there's also a

664
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,240
scratch pad marked down this is where

665
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,919
you can just throw random notes and

666
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,480
collection pieces along the way without

667
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,880
mucking up the markdown for a specific

668
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
machine

669
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,679
and again the sitrep report only applies

670
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,279
to the engagement that we're doing at

671
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,200
hand and if i get confused and let's say

672
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,559
for example i'm

673
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,760
over in

674
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,120
doing something else and i decided you

675
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,640
know what i want to start back on my pen

676
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,480
200 class again

677
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,120
what was

678
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,399
what even was the

679
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,880
the last engagement i was working on i

680
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,679
just run auto report active it queries

681
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,120
what it knows about all of our

682
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,720
engagements there could be thousands of

683
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,000
them and it's going to say this is the

684
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,840
last one you were working on and here's

685
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,279
the directory you were working out of

686
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,360
so i'm going to cd back over into that

687
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,960
and the targets file for this

688
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
is empty there's some training where

689
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,320
you're going to have to update that

690
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,559
manually and it's true of your exam it's

691
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,919
true of an actual pen test

692
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,360
because we're not going to be able to

693
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
preload that for you from a programmatic

694
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,520
standpoint easily

695
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,840
go into report and you'll notice report

696
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
just contains basically markdown files

697
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,440
at this point

698
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,520
for for the sake of time and argument

699
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,320
let's say we completed pen 200 we've

700
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
successfully poned every system in the

701
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,960
lab all the domains and our report is

702
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,039
complete and we're ready to finalize

703
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,039
that

704
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
we just run one command

705
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,200
the pdf is created for us by merging all

706
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,480
of those markdown files with a number

707
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,440
and then the 7-zip archive is created

708
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,600
and on the file system if i go back to

709
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,440
my training i now have an offensive

710
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,960
security folder

711
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,400
and i can look into that reports

712
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,559
directory here's the 7-zip archive with

713
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,440
the pdf included

714
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,200
and here's the actual pdf i'm going to

715
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,640
scroll out a little bit

716
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,559
now you notice i forgot to put my

717
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,159
offensive security student id

718
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,000
i am working on a bug to fix that it

719
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
prompts for it for the exam but it

720
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,679
doesn't do it for the training yet

721
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,279
we also have

722
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,240
a breakdown on the side for the pdf as

723
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,840
well as

724
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,919
in the document itself so if you want to

725
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,159
jump to a specific section you just

726
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,360
click the link and it'll take you right

727
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,960
there it's already pre-built just by

728
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
running auto report finalize you don't

729
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,919
have to do anything special within your

730
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,760
markdown

731
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
all right that's training

732
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,039
the second

733
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:55,760
uh

734
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,600
use case that we have is actually taking

735
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,520
an exam i mean after all one of the

736
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,120
capstones that we want to do is we want

737
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,000
to

738
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,960
show

739
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,480
that we actually have performed some

740
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,320
training and gain some knowledge and one

741
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,400
of the ways we do that is a we can write

742
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
stuff out on the interwebs we can post

743
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,480
videos about them but ideally we're

744
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,760
going to want to get an

745
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,159
security certification so i'm just going

746
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,200
to run auto report

747
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,840
startup up it's hard to talk and type at

748
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,320
the same time

749
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,399
and this time instead of picking

750
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,559
training i'm going to pick exam

751
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,720
and there's a pre-canned list of exams

752
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,960
included within auto report where it

753
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,039
knows the report structure it knows the

754
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,200
layout and it has those pre-canned for

755
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,880
you thanks to no raj i want to point

756
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,720
that out no raj's work with markdown was

757
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,240
phenomenal love it

758
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,760
one of the ones that i'm working on

759
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,279
personally is the practical network

760
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,080
penetration tester exam and converting

761
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,520
heath adams document file into markdown

762
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,279
so it will be baked in from scratch that

763
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,640
one's got a little bit of rough edges

764
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,840
right now

765
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,960
but for right now we're going to take

766
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,399
the oscp

767
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,480
what is my os id it is going to be one

768
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,799
two three four five apologies if that is

769
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,279
a legit os id number for somebody out in

770
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,480
the wild

771
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,159
um

772
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,640
and there you go i mean we can now

773
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,720
change directory into that

774
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,880
into that location

775
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,880
and wait for the the countdown and the

776
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,799
email to come into our inbox we can kick

777
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,760
off that vpn access and get started uh

778
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,520
on the lab and my workflow for

779
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,159
documentation on an exam is really no

780
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,960
different than training i'm gonna edit

781
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,840
my

782
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,320
i'm going to edit my targets file to

783
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,320
include the 4 ip addresses that aren't

784
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,159
the buffer overflow box

785
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,240
pop those in there i'm going to run auto

786
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,799
recon on those and while those are going

787
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,159
you got it you guessed it right i mean

788
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,360
the same workflow that we do with

789
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,880
everything else i'm going to get started

790
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,360
on the buffer overflow box

791
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
i've got a scratch pad here for ideas

792
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,919
that come to my mind while i'm doing it

793
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,159
and the sip rip sit rep is still growing

794
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,760
and and running with us

795
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,080
and just like with the pen 200 course

796
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,399
whenever we're complete with all of

797
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,000
these items we just run auto report

798
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,320
finalize

799
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,520
and i'm not trying to drag out the

800
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,679
meeting here i'm really not i'm just

801
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,279
cutting through it as fast as i can to

802
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,200
show you from a from a workflow

803
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,840
perspective from pre-engagement during

804
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,720
the engagement and after the engagement

805
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,640
everything is seamless with with auto

806
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,360
report hopefully i mean it

807
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,520
so we've got once again

808
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,960
i'm gonna go back over here to auto

809
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,200
report exams directory offensive

810
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,120
security oscp

811
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,600
and let me pause here for just a second

812
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,960
you'll notice that each of these

813
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,360
directories contains the engagement that

814
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,840
you're going after as well as a date

815
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,159
stamp that means i failed the exam in

816
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,200
may if i take the oscp again in in three

817
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,360
months i'm going to get a new working

818
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,760
directory so i'm not going to gunk up my

819
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,679
previous attempt that now gets to stay

820
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,200
pristine as an archive that i can

821
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,440
reference later on and this new one is

822
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,720
something that i can

823
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,240
push through with success because i'm

824
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,440
going to pass it this next time

825
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,360
and here's our report directory it's

826
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,600
created the 7-zip archive file for us if

827
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,919
we wanted to we could

828
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,200
include

829
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,240
or add the file from our pen 200 pdf to

830
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,399
this so we can submit both the pen 200

831
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,880
lab report as well as the exam report

832
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,640
for the oscp

833
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,200
and here's rocp

834
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,960
exam report you'll notice that it does

835
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,320
include our student id which is required

836
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,919
and we have

837
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,480
everything we need to

838
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,640
showcase what we've done on the systems

839
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,559
complete done

840
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,320
obviously we would need to write the

841
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,720
actual report for each of these boxes as

842
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,760
we as we own them

843
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,320
so that is the exam

844
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,720
let's take a look at doing a ctf

845
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,960
what if

846
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,799
and we're kind of hoping we can do this

847
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,399
we're going to do a ctf uh the ctf event

848
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,919
name is b-sides greenville

849
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,440
21

850
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,679
and the team name uh the team that i'm

851
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,399
on is defcon 864

852
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,080
and we publish a bunch of our stuff into

853
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,679
martin for some of the things that we do

854
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,960
if you want to write it to a blog report

855
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,080
or something like that afterwards

856
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,679
because we're all concerned about that

857
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,440
that write up afterwards because the

858
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,600
lessons learned you'll notice i now have

859
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,080
a whole new area here called ctf for the

860
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,480
engagement of b-sides greenville 21

861
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,159
and my team name

862
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,320
so if this was on a network share

863
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,279
uh as we engage in what we find in the

864
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,320
network let's say we find a new

865
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,279
um

866
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,799
hang on let me get to that directory so

867
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,320
i can show that to you

868
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,559
so right now in this directory there's

869
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,200
only one file for the actual

870
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,519
work the actual engagement and for the

871
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,440
most part anything that is a template

872
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,679
related to training or ctf right now

873
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,320
includes

874
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,039
a section at the top for lessons learned

875
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,720
this was put in there to help you with

876
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,559
the after action review where not only

877
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,840
do you complete the learning and the

878
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,640
training but it includes those wonderful

879
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,559
areas where you look at it not navel

880
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,399
gazing but you think through what did i

881
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,720
do great what did i struggle with that's

882
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,640
now included in your report by default

883
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,919
if anything

884
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,720
the the training and the ctf templates

885
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,039
make it a one-stop shop you do the work

886
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,480
and then i wanted to make it easy to be

887
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,760
able to share that with the rest of the

888
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,679
world post it on medium post it on your

889
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,840
blog whatever you wanted to do use it as

890
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,640
a script for a youtube video there it is

891
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,039
but let's say in the ctf uh we

892
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,880
discovered that there is a new machine

893
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,720
something that you know one of the one

894
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,159
of our teammates says hey there's a new

895
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,840
machine on the on the wire

896
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,480
i can just run auto report add it says

897
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,919
do you know the target ip address i'm

898
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,200
just going to say

899
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,880
yes i do

900
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,960
here it is

901
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,919
and it creates a new file for us and it

902
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,480
updates the target.md file so if i cat

903
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,799
it's now added that ip address into the

904
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,919
mix and i now have a new markdown file

905
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,080
specific to that ip address

906
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,159
ready to go so if we're on a network

907
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,000
share the team's working together we're

908
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
working and adding those files on the

909
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,760
fly and auto report is just

910
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,279
automatically adding and picking those

911
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,159
up in the workflow no problem

912
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,240
i do want by the way those of you in

913
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,399
defcon 864 when we do get back into our

914
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,559
ctf lab again i really want to test this

915
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,240
with a full-blown all of us hammering

916
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,519
away on it i want to see if we can break

917
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,880
that so

918
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,200
there we go throwing that out there

919
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
nothing like senior code

920
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,480
for one die

921
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,279
um auto report ctf is done we won

922
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,399
so let's go ahead and can that report

923
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,559
and wrap it up for us we've got

924
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,000
the final report is in markdown

925
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,159
and you can see that it changed it from

926
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,440
the obsidian markdown that we were

927
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,119
working with before and it's changed

928
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,800
into the common markdown file format

929
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
that i can just click the button at the

930
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,760
top here and actually see what it looks

931
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,879
like in the finished product

932
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,679
the last two we have from example

933
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,040
perspective

934
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,000
our bug bounties

935
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,560
number three for a bug bounty we're

936
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,399
gonna do bug crowd

937
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,399
and the program that we're going after

938
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,960
in bug crowd is called defcon 864

939
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,639
and this time we're going to do it in

940
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,879
the github formatted markdown language

941
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,918
which is number six

942
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,639
again exact same workflow

943
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,119
i can cd into that directory and the the

944
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,119
cool thing is i can be anywhere on this

945
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,560
file system

946
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,159
um i mean i'm not in that working

947
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,520
directory right now but if i run

948
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,720
what i want to do next

949
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,280
it knows where that sit rep file is

950
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,200
located for the active engagement and it

951
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,359
writes it there so i can come back up to

952
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,800
my bug bounty

953
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,720
for this engagement and i can say where

954
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,480
did i leave off oh yeah i kicked off

955
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,760
auto recon

956
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,720
when i run the ports command it logs

957
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,640
that it ran the board if i log a

958
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,599
vulnerability it logs the vulnerability

959
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,359
uh here in the system in fact if i go

960
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,440
back into metasploitable 2 for just a

961
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,680
brief sec because i forgot to mention

962
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,839
this

963
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,520
and look at the sitrep you'll notice

964
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,280
that it creates a backup of the

965
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,200
vulnerability i logged i'm really bad

966
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,480
about fat fingering something and

967
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,040
screwing up a file

968
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,800
but here in this case if i needed to i

969
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
could rebuild that file

970
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,119
and then a pen tr pen test is the exact

971
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,760
same thing it's the exact same thing

972
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,760
um

973
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,920
1964 my client name is going to be

974
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,760
besides greenville i don't have

975
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,440
authorization to do this so technically

976
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,200
i probably shouldn't be doing that and

977
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,640
they have a jira

978
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,000
instance that they want to allow all of

979
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,359
their their findings to so i'm just

980
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,119
going to pick jira as the output and

981
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,280
there you go no surprises exact same

982
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,359
workflow everything looks the same i'm

983
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,000
now no longer worried about um my work

984
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,680
my workflow in that regard

985
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,280
there is something that i want to point

986
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,040
out that you may have noticed as i was

987
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,640
working through this and that's the all

988
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,520
ttps folder that gets created

989
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,480
to have that in your same workflow area

990
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,320
that's if you wanted to create like your

991
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,079
punch list for how you pop active

992
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,680
directory what do your common sql

993
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,280
injection workflow that you do that's

994
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,160
where you collect all of those notes

995
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,200
and

996
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,119
that's the bulk of it i do have one

997
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,200
super secret thing that i want to show

998
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,640
you guys that's just recently been

999
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,320
released but first i want to open it up

1000
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,200
for questions before i fly through

1001
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,680
any further are there any questions

1002
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,680
how long have you been working on this

1003
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,320
since about may and it started out super

1004
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,320
simple

1005
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,200
but it's definitely gone way off track

1006
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,240
all right

1007
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,720
so the super secret thing that's just

1008
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,800
been released

1009
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,079
there may come a point when you've done

1010
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,520
a ton of engagements and at the end of

1011
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,200
the year you want to look back and say

1012
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,880
you know man i've done a lot of things

1013
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,320
this year but it'd be really nice to

1014
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,240
know kind of maybe some stats and

1015
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,480
statistics on that so you might sit

1016
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,320
there in a very dramatic fashion say

1017
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,760
what have i done

1018
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,200
well i just ask auto report that

1019
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,280
and see what it comes back with

1020
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,680
and it tells me that i've started a few

1021
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,839
things and never finished them i've

1022
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,760
started some other stuff and actually

1023
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,880
finished them

1024
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,200
and if i had started an engagement and

1025
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,119
run ports or volumes or something like

1026
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,560
that it would show it as being in

1027
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,880
progress and this is a great way for me

1028
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,960
to look back and just take stock and

1029
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,560
inventory about where my strengths and

1030
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,240
weaknesses are at a macro level

1031
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,800
so it was a really quick introduction

1032
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,720
but my hope is that this is a tool that

1033
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,560
all of you can use and i hope everybody

1034
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,720
uh grabs it and kicks the tires on it if

1035
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,880
you have any problems or run into any

1036
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,400
issues with it

1037
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,240
open an issue on the github page and

1038
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,320
i'll address it as quickly as i can with

1039
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,079
all that spare time that i have

1040
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,200
and uh

1041
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,760
but yeah it's for you it's released gpl3

1042
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,280
so it's open source

1043
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,599
uh enjoy
