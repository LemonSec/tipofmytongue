1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,920
all right

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,240
well uh for those of you that are

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,920
sticking with track one so i appreciate

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,360
you guys for hanging in there

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,240
um

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,120
and

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,160
um

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,079
send through uh we're gonna talk about

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,920
reconnaissance so another one of the

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,359
areas that i'm very passionate about um

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,240
so

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,720
if if you heard the industrial control

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,480
talk earlier that's definitely one of

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,359
the the main focuses and passions i have

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,238
have these days and um

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,120
you know and also reconnaissance

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,360
penetration testing is something that

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,520
that i've been involved with in for a

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,760
very long time and

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,559
um

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:43,280
you

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,039
when we look at reconnaissance really is

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,840
that first phase of of a penetration

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,680
test that

25
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,559
and to me it's one of the most if not

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,360
the most important uh phase of pen

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,079
testing uh maybe beside that we include

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,440
writing the report right that we're

29
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
going to turn around and deliver to the

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,159
the client at the end of an engagement

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,360
but

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,520
this is this is actually based off of

33
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,880
part of

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,840
what

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,040
part of a section i have on

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
reconnaissance in the

37
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,600
the two-day pin test class that i teach

38
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
about once a year

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
and so i actually took some of that

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,040
content and put it into one of my

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
greenville tech classes i actually have

42
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,520
two different

43
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,759
pen testing classes in the the cyber

44
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,920
security program that we have there

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,159
which is really exciting so we have a

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,600
the first

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,240
class or first course maps out basically

48
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,159
to the pen test plus or i think

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,400
certified ethical hacker certifications

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,720
and then the second one is more we talk

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,960
about advanced pin testing or

52
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
part of it is more realistic pin testing

53
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,720
and uh

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
not not that pin test plus doesn't do a

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,960
good job of aligning with with realistic

56
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,040
content for the most part

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,799
but also

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,280
you know getting realistic pin testing

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
and kind of almost see it as a

60
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,360
how to prep to like take the oscp course

61
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,680
as well so to give give students a head

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,919
start on on this kind of like everything

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,840
i wish i knew

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,120
before taking the oscp class so and then

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
and then some so so we'll talk about

66
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,000
writing buffer overflows and manual

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,160
exploitation so so i've added all of

68
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,080
that to the the two day pen test class

69
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
as well and renewed some of the the uh

70
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,720
other sections but

71
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,200
so with quick start recon the idea is i

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,480
always i'm a big fan of the 80 20 rule

73
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
right or paradise principle

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,280
where

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,840
you depending on what we're looking at

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,200
right we can always

77
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
kind of bring up the 80 20 rule if you

78
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,840
know if you work in a business right if

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,760
you maybe own your own business they

80
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,239
always talk about 80 of your profits

81
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,440
come from

82
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,360
20 of your clients

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,879
which is an interesting

84
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,080
way to to look at it or if i'm doing a a

85
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,319
pen test right and i'm doing

86
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,840
reconnaissance

87
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,239
that i think well 80 of the relative

88
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,040
results you know the results i need

89
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,000
that relate to the target that i'm i'm

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840
working with right

91
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,800
is comes from about 20

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,120
of of the work

93
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,080
yeah where the way i look at it is i can

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,440
spend

95
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
let's say 10 hours doing reconnaissance

96
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
using a handful of tools like we're

97
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,400
going to talk about here um to find

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,879
probably really even 90 95 of the

99
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,120
information that's out there

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
could i spend another 10 or 20 hours or

101
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,640
40 hours finding more information

102
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,319
sure

103
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,840
but the more time i

104
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,480
spend then i'm it's a very little return

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
on investment

106
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,280
and so it takes a long much longer to

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,080
find little pieces of information that

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
more than likely aren't going to pay off

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,799
in in the long run

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,280
so not to say don't do that if you have

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,640
the time

112
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,200
but uh most of us aren't going to have

113
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,040
the time especially with pin

114
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,360
performing penetration tests that you

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,519
know we're under the gun right we only

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,000
have a limited amount of time to get in

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,120
and find what we're looking for uh

118
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
be able to exploit that the target gain

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
access and meet our objectives or

120
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,880
missions and then turn around and report

121
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,960
for for our clients

122
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,400
and so

123
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,520
again this

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,759
talk really is and it's part demo and

125
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,360
and i realized also there's a lot of

126
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,440
great other tools out there so you for

127
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,160
those of you that that um

128
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,759
they are familiar with the tools if

129
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,759
you're using those tools be sure to to

130
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,360
put them in the discord channel you know

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
this is not

132
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
a meant to be um a comprehensive list in

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,960
any stretch of the imagination uh if

134
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,560
anything erase it's supposed to be quite

135
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,919
the opposite right it's here's a few

136
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,600
tools right that we can use

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
to perform reconnaissance against an

138
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,039
organization maybe you know we should be

139
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,560
also performing reconnaissance against

140
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,639
our own organization to see what's

141
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,320
exposed to the internet that we don't

142
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,880
know when i do pen tests for clients

143
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
outside of my floor work

144
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,759
it's

145
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,160
i've never had a client

146
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,800
where i didn't find something that they

147
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
weren't worried you know that they were

148
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,720
not aware about

149
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,320
you know maybe it's an old website that

150
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,680
they spun up 10 years ago and they

151
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,919
didn't realize it was still out there

152
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,759
maybe it was the client that their

153
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,759
system admin was hosting

154
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,960
you know their web server at his house

155
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,800
instead of the data center that they

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
thought they were paying for

157
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,039
or maybe it is that industrial control

158
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,720
system that you have

159
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,000
connected directly to the internet

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,400
there's always something that that an

161
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,800
organization isn't aware about because

162
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
they're not doing their own

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,479
reconnaissance so that's another

164
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,800
idea behind this quick start

165
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840
you know process is that it can act as

166
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,560
that little cheat sheet right to help

167
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,160
organizations right and and you working

168
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,479
for your company to to perform your own

169
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,319
reconnaissance right when we talk about

170
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
hack ourselves right to see

171
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,639
right where our exposures are

172
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,120
so the first place will typically start

173
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,600
is the the target's main domain and so

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,039
of course i work at flora i know where

175
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,440
all the i guess the proverbial skeletons

176
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,759
are are buried at least the the ones

177
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,039
that have been

178
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,720
been buried in the last 10 years that

179
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
i've worked with yeah i'm very familiar

180
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,070
i run vulnerability management and

181
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,360
[Music]

182
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,520
penetration testing and incident

183
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,440
detection response so i know all of the

184
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,600
systems that are connected to the

185
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
internet but we're always continually

186
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
looking for new ones because somebody

187
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
could turn turn something up in in the

188
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,759
environment and we wouldn't know about

189
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,440
we actually had an employee i was

190
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,639
probably about two years ago that

191
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,720
thought it would be great to stand up a

192
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,639
windows server in amazon

193
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,639
and expose remote desktop to the outside

194
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,520
world it was for you know for a project

195
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,639
and that was something you know we

196
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,880
caught you know within probably about 24

197
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
hours because we are doing

198
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
reconnaissance on a regular basis

199
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,840
and so you know go go shadow id right so

200
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,360
somebody was

201
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,120
definitely it was a corporate security

202
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,440
policy violation uh issued for that to

203
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,919
say to say the least right but anyways

204
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,599
so talking about

205
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,680
you know reconnaissance i always

206
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,520
you know we do this in class and and

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,000
we'll go through this um exercise you

208
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,120
can see our b size event dashboard for

209
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,160
but um looking at i always will always

210
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,880
go to the fortune 500 list

211
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,360
and just to get an idea of targets now

212
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,960
you can look at sure for small

213
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,720
medium-sized environments there's just

214
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,160
typically you know it's kind of hit or

215
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
miss whether they have a lot to actually

216
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,360
look at so it's a lot easier if you use

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,199
a larger company

218
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,199
i don't like using floor we're we're

219
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,319
still fortune 200 um but at the same

220
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,560
time it's you know it's again it's one

221
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,960
i'm very familiar with so it's almost

222
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,039
like cheating um we'll typically go

223
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,400
let's go

224
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,199
um

225
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,400
you know maybe

226
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,440
pick um i've seen a couple of these um

227
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,840
any suggestions

228
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
maybe off of this list i'll just leave

229
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,840
it here

230
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,000
don't do wells fargo because that one

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
didn't have a lot of hits on the

232
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,240
homework okay

233
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,759
hey sean

234
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,808
see one of my students

235
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:36,880
[Music]

236
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,958
but why don't i know somebody actually

237
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,919
did disney i saw disney in there um that

238
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,519
was me

239
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,120
there's hillary so how about uh so cisco

240
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,080
my

241
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,920
there's there's cisco and then there's

242
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,080
cisco which is funny because i used to

243
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,720
know the the gentleman that ran

244
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,959
uh sales for all of cisco and we used a

245
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,120
joke that he worked for this cisco which

246
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,399
is the the food distribution company

247
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,080
so we kept asking hey can you give us

248
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
like some free free cans of uh

249
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,360
like corn

250
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,920
you used to hate that

251
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
does um

252
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,680
if amazon i think amazon owns twitch and

253
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,680
twitch is on um

254
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,519
on the spotlight right now you want to

255
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,959
do

256
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,120
you mean twitch is amazon fire right now

257
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,800
yeah it's one of those that's too big

258
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,600
though um maybe allstate like allstate's

259
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,080
my insurance provider let's look at that

260
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,640
let's see look at that one um and

261
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,800
they're probably and you can see right

262
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
i'll allstate.com comes up because yeah

263
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
i go and had to pay my you know

264
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,519
insurance bill yesterday this is the one

265
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,959
i don't have on

266
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,000
uh direct deposit or direct

267
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,399
automatic payments right

268
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,480
so we know we already have a domain name

269
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,959
the nice thing is most organizations

270
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,240
have at least one main domain name that

271
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,320
they focus with right because that's

272
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,560
their point of presence to everyone in

273
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,640
the world on the internet right it's

274
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,480
probably in social media right there's

275
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,680
probably at allstate.com everywhere and

276
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,440
you know on all the social media

277
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,720
platforms uh all of the employee email

278
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
addresses probably come from something

279
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
at allstate.com

280
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,480
now it doesn't mean that there aren't

281
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,640
other domains out there

282
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,800
right this it just means that this is

283
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,040
going to be our starting place like

284
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,000
floor if you look at yeah my email

285
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
address is at floor.com but we actually

286
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
have a lot of other domains that we use

287
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,200
like fdnet.com would be would be one

288
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
that you would see if you perform

289
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,120
reconnaissance against floor

290
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,600
that's a very popular domain for

291
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,880
um

292
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,200
for us to use on those external facing

293
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,240
systems

294
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,760
but again it's not one you're going to

295
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,079
know about unless you're doing the

296
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,000
reconnaissance it's

297
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,839
itself right

298
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,839
um and it's not a charter yet

299
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,800
the isps can be tricky because you have

300
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,360
the corporation and then you have

301
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,120
the the actual

302
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,200
kind of internet backbone that they're

303
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,440
responsible for and handing out so for

304
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,519
these types of conversations it gets a

305
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,000
little bit tricky so that's why i

306
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,120
decided not to to go there right but

307
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
yeah we're going to start with the the

308
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
main domain and i know allstate's not

309
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,920
that exciting but

310
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,680
so um but yeah we're looking for yeah we

311
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
know at right allstate.com it's going to

312
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,720
be used for employees right again it's

313
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,399
that mean starting point again keep in

314
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,839
the back of your mind

315
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,000
there could be other domains out there

316
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,760
right we want to also perform

317
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,920
reconnaissance against those as we find

318
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,160
them

319
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,079
but we'll focus on again as a starting

320
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,640
point the main domain itself

321
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,920
and so dns linux is a tool uh that i use

322
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,760
a lot in doing whether it's

323
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,079
reconnaissance or in incident detection

324
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,560
and response where i want to find out oh

325
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,160
here's an ip address that looks like

326
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,399
it's attacking me or maybe i have a you

327
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,639
know an outbound connection to an ip

328
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,160
address and i wonder what the heck is

329
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,040
that

330
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,920
then

331
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,240
i'll use dns linux so let's go ahead and

332
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,480
use dns lytics

333
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,560
and and probably some of you if you have

334
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
you know other again other sites out

335
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,399
there that you use definitely throw them

336
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,600
into the chat channel which which are

337
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,160
great uh but in this case yeah we'll do

338
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,160
allstate.com

339
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,880
and

340
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
just click search right and this is a

341
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,160
starting point we'll come back to dns

342
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,440
lytics

343
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,120
for a couple of different things because

344
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,240
you can see

345
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,839
in the search field they can actually

346
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,720
take domain names ip addresses and so

347
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,959
you can see and version four versus six

348
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,720
and then autonomous system numbers that

349
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
we're also going to be

350
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,800
talking about right and you can see that

351
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,959
okay we found allstate.com it's actually

352
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,279
a fairly popular website on the internet

353
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,120
right fairly large company with a lot of

354
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,320
users

355
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
or a lot of clients and then we can

356
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
start looking at some of their dns

357
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,880
records right and do me a favor and use

358
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,720
the discord and not the the zoom chat

359
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,040
especially once i get into the demos but

360
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,399
so we can see

361
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,360
the the a records and then the aaa

362
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,880
records

363
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,600
so what's the aaa record for

364
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
anybody want to throw it in discord for

365
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,399
a giveaway prize

366
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,600
yeah it's ip version six

367
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,880
don't put a question though say it with

368
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,399
conviction

369
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,279
right yeah it's for ipv version six

370
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,120
so with with

371
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,720
a single like ipv4 right which is

372
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600
32 bits long right

373
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,399
ipv6 is four times as long so they

374
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,240
thought they're being funny and

375
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,800
quadruple a like okay i get it right

376
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,639
anyways right so we see a couple of

377
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,399
records right and basically it's just

378
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,760
saying oh this 167 address right is

379
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,079
probably their main website and what we

380
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,240
can do is the nice thing about dns linux

381
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
it says hey there's two different

382
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,199
domains that are hosted on or associated

383
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,360
with that ip address and you can see oh

384
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
yeah there's allstate.com which is that

385
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,199
main starting point and now we already

386
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,360
found another domain that we want to

387
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,720
look at because here's one called

388
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,199
allstate

389
00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:22,240
emarketing.com right that's something we

390
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,399
didn't know about 30 seconds ago

391
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,399
and it's another domain that we can do

392
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,360
further

393
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
reconnaissance on and find out more

394
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,279
information because it could lead to

395
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,120
other systems and those systems could

396
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,839
lead to services and those services and

397
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,199
applications could lead to

398
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,519
vulnerabilities and that's what those

399
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,480
vulnerabilities are what could lead us

400
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,800
to gaining access to their network

401
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
so that's one of the great features of

402
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,760
dns linux i

403
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,240
i love dns like so we even have a user

404
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,519
paid account in fact actually i think i

405
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,199
have to renew it but

406
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,240
we can see sure there's the dns servers

407
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
for allstate

408
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,079
uh now this is an interesting thing

409
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,279
we're already seeing that we're going to

410
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,639
come back and talk about i don't want to

411
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,720
jump too far ahead

412
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,120
and then we see the mx records right so

413
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,560
these are mail servers so if you're

414
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,760
sending to anybody at allstate.com

415
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
you're sending to these iep addresses

416
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,320
but it's not servers hosted directly on

417
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,920
the allstate network right because you

418
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,199
see it's actually going through

419
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,800
proofpoints so they're using proofpoint

420
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,519
for

421
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,839
email security

422
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,480
and so and then you can find some who is

423
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,600
information

424
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,440
down below so you can see who is it

425
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,199
registered to

426
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,480
so you can see

427
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,320
there's you know some email addresses

428
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,000
this dsa like dns admin at allstate.com

429
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
there's a phone number right here's an

430
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
address right so we could probably look

431
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,440
at you know is this the same address as

432
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,839
well look at how about allstate you know

433
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,040
corporate

434
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,839
headquarters

435
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,519
address right i think if you just do

436
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,199
like i'll say it will actually pop up

437
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,040
their their headquarters right and you

438
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,560
can actually see

439
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
you know is this probably going to be a

440
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,519
match

441
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,480
for

442
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,720
um either their corporate headquarters

443
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,920
which is going to be

444
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,440
more important

445
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,720
a little bit later on in our

446
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,839
conversation so this looks

447
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,120
i don't know if we actually got

448
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
usually they actually give you the

449
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,440
address on it

450
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,950
there's gonna will

451
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,009
[Music]

452
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,240
address for all state

453
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,839
[Music]

454
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,839
recorders

455
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,279
okay so 2775 sanders

456
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,920
and well there's three zero seven five

457
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,680
sanders so we're in the right

458
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,040
neighborhood right so yeah it's

459
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,360
definitely associated with with allstate

460
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
and again there's there is a reason

461
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,720
we're going to come back and and want to

462
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,920
try to physically tie in the ip

463
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,399
addresses and the domain names uh to

464
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,120
those those locations

465
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,959
so we have the domain name again we

466
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,199
started to find other domain names and

467
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,919
we started to find physical locations

468
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,039
associated with these domains right and

469
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,319
and ideally then we're going to start

470
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,559
working with you know ip addresses as

471
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,640
well and those iep addresses that can

472
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,799
also be part of autonomous system

473
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,079
numbers which we're going to talk about

474
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,919
if you're not familiar with

475
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,359
with the

476
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,319
concept right

477
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,879
all right

478
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,440
so we talked about reverse ip lookups

479
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,960
right where it found like other domains

480
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,640
here's the example for floor where we

481
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
might have you know 50 domains on a

482
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,160
single ip address right but

483
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,799
now let's look at another favorite tool

484
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,440
uh dns dumpster i didn't come across

485
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,960
this till i don't know probably two and

486
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,200
a half years ago and i couldn't believe

487
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,120
i hadn't heard about it before then it's

488
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,520
actually created by the folks at hacker

489
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,280
target

490
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,240
and

491
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,120
and so we can go back and put in

492
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,440
allstate.com as our

493
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,160
target domain and you can see it takes

494
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,200
all of

495
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,000
a few seconds to come back and create a

496
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,440
list of well yeah here's a hundred hosts

497
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,520
that we found and then oh we found a

498
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,640
couple of

499
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
posts in proof point which we already

500
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,400
saw earlier right

501
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,799
and so yeah we see again there's the the

502
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,679
dns records we see oh there's their

503
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,600
their mail records right pointing to to

504
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,760
prove point right we see a bunch of text

505
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,400
records so a lot of times you can see

506
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,120
the tech text records if anything can

507
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,440
show relationships between one company

508
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,840
and and other companies so you can see

509
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,919
like flex area is a product so they use

510
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,840
flex area probably flex net in some way

511
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,400
shape or form right there's some tie-in

512
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,720
with apple right and so on and and so

513
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,520
forth right i think they use webex

514
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,000
right so we have a lot of tie-ins with

515
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,600
with text records you're to see not

516
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
necessarily what we're looking for there

517
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,360
but it's all important information to

518
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,240
have

519
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,559
what we're looking for from dns dumpster

520
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,280
really is the host records

521
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,520
and we want to look for patterns as

522
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,640
we're going through the the page looking

523
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,280
in not only patterns in the host names

524
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,559
but also

525
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,720
and potentially other domain names but

526
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,280
also the ip addresses you know on the

527
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,600
right hand side the autonomous system

528
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,880
and now they're not showing us the

529
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,559
number but they're showing us the name

530
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,120
that's associated with that autonomous

531
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,960
system number which again we're going to

532
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,280
come back and talk about in just one sec

533
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,160
but if i'm scrolling through the idea is

534
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,640
i already see a pretty obvious pattern

535
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,600
here

536
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,559
which is what yeah i see allstate

537
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,880
insurance company right all everything

538
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,200
ends in allstate.com

539
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,760
but what's in particular about

540
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,400
the ip addresses

541
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,520
they're all part of the same um

542
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,120
subnet

543
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
they're all part of the same subnet yeah

544
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,880
they all in this case you can see

545
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,840
there's oh

546
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,880
167.127.142 there's 167.127.

547
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,640
right so it looks like everything's

548
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,520
starting with

549
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,120
167.127 so they might especially as a

550
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,679
large company have a full class b range

551
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,000
but we can check that by let's just take

552
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,679
one of these ip addresses go back to dns

553
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,039
lytics which i'll go ahead and open it

554
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,240
up in a different window

555
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,120
i can do a search

556
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,280
and then we go back to the who is

557
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,880
information the great information about

558
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,200
the who is not only tells us sure it's

559
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,320
registered with this party but

560
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,480
it actually tells us here's the net

561
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,679
range

562
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,640
that's associated with the the isp

563
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,600
and here in particular is the range that

564
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,039
is assigned

565
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,600
to the company so yeah so allstate has

566
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,240
an entire class b address so you can

567
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,960
have over 64 000 ip addresses that are

568
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,880
possible in this range this is just like

569
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,200
floor we actually have a class b anytime

570
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,880
you see anything that starts with

571
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,520
141.197

572
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,200
that's going to be

573
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,840
before

574
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,640
so

575
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,240
so we're going to take

576
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,360
this ip range that we've confirmed right

577
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,440
and just copy that for now because we

578
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,200
know anything in that range is

579
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,960
associated with allstate

580
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,760
and the kicker is now let's

581
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,000
see if we keep scrolling through the

582
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,960
allstate records so allstate actually is

583
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,960
probably an interesting

584
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,630
case study

585
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,679
[Music]

586
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,559
because yeah they really are so what we

587
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,720
kind of get into is this idea

588
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,280
everything that we see so far except for

589
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,600
their mail servers that are hosted or at

590
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,440
least they're we should say the email

591
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,200
gateway right that's hosted as

592
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,320
proofpoint it looks like everything else

593
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,760
is hosted

594
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,799
on the actual allstate network

595
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,760
now

596
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
they're going to be other hosts that are

597
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,440
out there and more than likely they are

598
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,919
because you can see by default hacker

599
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,640
target only will give you in dns

600
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,919
dumpster 100 records

601
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,960
now the really cool thing is if you have

602
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,000
used tools like recon ng recon ng has a

603
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,720
plug-in called actual hacker target and

604
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,159
if you use it

605
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,919
and you do the same query for

606
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,159
allstate.com it'll actually give you up

607
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,120
to 500 hosts so if you want more than

608
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,280
that you have to pay for it so i guess i

609
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,039
didn't stipulate the whole part of the

610
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,960
quick start whole point of the quick

611
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,000
start recon process is also using free

612
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
resources right so we don't have to pay

613
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,640
for any tools

614
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
but so in this case you can see right

615
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,480
that we have

616
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,600
all of these resources that appear

617
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,520
again on the surface that they're all

618
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,760
hosted on the allstate network i don't

619
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,039
see any other cloud hosted uh services

620
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,080
like

621
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,240
you know website that might be hosted

622
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,919
like floor hosts you know our main

623
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,720
website like at akamai right so somebody

624
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,559
wanted to break into the floor network

625
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,320
are they really going to target a web

626
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,640
server hosted in akamine

627
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
probably not they want to find those

628
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,240
resources that are exposed and connected

629
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,220
directly to

630
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,320
[Music]

631
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,960
the target network so all of these could

632
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,360
be again on the surface these all look

633
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,280
like they're attached to the allstate

634
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,640
network and that's partly reconfirmed by

635
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,720
what we call this autonomous system

636
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,159
number so i want to go back and look at

637
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,240
this real quick because you can see oh

638
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,600
well here's akamai and it has this asn

639
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
called 20940

640
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,200
or yeah allstate has a asn called

641
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,120
as11520 the thing is and you see like

642
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,520
floor has an autonomous system number

643
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,440
think of like a company like floor right

644
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,760
we're a global organization we have ip

645
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,919
addresses all around the world we have

646
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,240
250 firewalls alone

647
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,080
spread out around the world

648
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,600
and some of them most of them are in the

649
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,120
141.197 range but then there's others

650
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,200
that are also another range

651
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,760
and so what we can do is we can say that

652
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,240
hey all of these ip addresses from all

653
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,919
these different subnets

654
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,279
belong to this one company called floor

655
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,600
and so we pull them all together in one

656
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,320
autonomous system number right just at a

657
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,240
high level for reconnaissance purposes

658
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,159
right now

659
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,960
and so when we look at that asn right

660
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,840
that's specific to allstate any ip

661
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,679
addresses or domain names that are

662
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,159
associated with this autonomous system

663
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,159
number belong to our friends in allstate

664
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,559
and so then you can go back and now look

665
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,720
at what we're finding we're not only

666
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,240
finding

667
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,880
ip subnet ranges

668
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,480
right that we saw earlier like 167.127

669
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,360
but

670
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,640
hey we see

671
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,360
oh 12.26.124

672
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,720
and it's now it's slipped as answer

673
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,480
financial so then it's like

674
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,159
well what's the tie-in there right that

675
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,400
would be something worth investigating

676
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,320
right we see allstate all-state

677
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,080
all-state all-state you know seeing if

678
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,679
we see anything new

679
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,000
right oh there's answer financial again

680
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,080
right american heritage life you know is

681
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,320
there a connection or maybe this is dns

682
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
lytics just screwing up but there's

683
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,480
probably a connection somewhere right

684
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,120
that we need to verify like let's verify

685
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,919
that answer financial is in the same

686
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,919
autonomous system number

687
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,159
and you can it looks like it is and so

688
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,240
there's some if you we probably look up

689
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,720
that company there's some connection to

690
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
allstate insurance right so it could be

691
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,960
another target for us in our penetration

692
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,480
test

693
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,720
if it your client didn't give it to you

694
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,039
though as a target right make sure you

695
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,360
get authorization from them before you

696
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,600
start targeting them in your attack

697
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,480
so

698
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,440
but

699
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,960
all right

700
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,320
um

701
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,600
i just wanna make sure we're on track

702
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,120
for time as well all right

703
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,640
so dns dumpster is a great utility right

704
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,480
though so we can look for patterns we

705
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,960
can also it'll identify you know if

706
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,679
there's cloud you know hosted resources

707
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,400
you know that use an allstate.com domain

708
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
sure and then right we can start looking

709
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,440
at all the host names themselves

710
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,039
and so you can see like vap 0 1 2 0

711
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,960
interesting but there's

712
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,720
some naming convention there that we

713
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
haven't figured out yet but because then

714
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,279
we see that 0 130 that 1240 right they

715
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,200
obviously mean something

716
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,960
they see sbc lab test 40 right we'd love

717
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,000
to see lab or tests

718
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
connected to the internet because

719
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,000
chances are those systems aren't as

720
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,120
up-to-date as production system

721
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,039
right we see owa blah blah blah owa we

722
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,880
typically start thinking of like outlook

723
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,520
web access right and maybe it is

724
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,360
maybe it's not but then you can also see

725
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,039
there's a sro there's a s h u and then

726
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,679
pull right so maybe you know those are

727
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,600
like location

728
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,320
names or indicators there's you know

729
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,080
there's a pattern there then we just

730
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,919
have to decipher it

731
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,760
gd 11 right

732
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,240
gateway maybe maybe it's a vpn appliance

733
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,039
right

734
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,760
there's lots of interesting

735
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,120
uh scenarios that we come up to to see

736
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,360
and then we also see right some other

737
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,679
names right we can sometimes also see oh

738
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,559
there's a web server exposed and then oh

739
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,200
there's actually here's a you know an

740
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,159
operating system or web server exposed

741
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,320
right we see there's a big ip

742
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,159
let's see what else if there's any other

743
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,159
more interesting

744
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,919
findings here

745
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,360
oh there's nginx right for s3 dot

746
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,399
allstate.com so that could bear further

747
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,679
investigation here's smtp3 right a mail

748
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,080
server probably so after your email that

749
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,760
you're sending to allstate goes through

750
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
proofpoint it's probably coming to one

751
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,960
of these mail servers like like smtp3

752
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,679
which is hosted on the allstate network

753
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,919
again which at least it appears to be

754
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,480
hosted on the allstate network right and

755
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,320
so on and so forth so we can look for

756
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,919
again we're looking for those

757
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,919
looking for those interesting names that

758
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,320
would make interesting targets right

759
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,919
because it's all about finding those

760
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,320
hosts and to find the services and

761
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,039
applications running on those hosts

762
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,120
to then find vulnerabilities in those

763
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,159
applications and services to exploit to

764
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,880
gain access

765
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
so again we got a hundred and again that

766
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,559
gave us a lot

767
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,880
if anything from this at a very high

768
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,120
level right we found

769
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,360
yeah we had 197 or 167.127

770
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,320
so the next place we would actually go

771
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,679
then is

772
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,520
one of my favorite places to go in the

773
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,799
world is is showdown

774
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,760
so we can log in

775
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,640
and then we can do a search once you

776
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,279
have even a basic free account right we

777
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,039
can do a search for a net block

778
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,679
like we found allstate has everything in

779
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,240
167.127

780
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,640
so we're telling showdown right show me

781
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,039
everything you know of in this range

782
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,360
because showdan will scan if you're not

783
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,919
familiar scans the entire internet now

784
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,919
they only scan it for a couple of dozen

785
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,840
ports so they're not looking for all 65

786
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,480
535 tcp ports which would take forever

787
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,640
but they're scanning for a couple of

788
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,559
dozen ports

789
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,600
and so you can see in that one range

790
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,200
that we were looking at

791
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,240
it found

792
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,080
1224 hosts

793
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,960
so do you think as a penetration tester

794
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,120
or as an attacker

795
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,399
if i had a 1224

796
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,559
hose to choose from

797
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,279
we could find a vulnerability to exploit

798
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,039
that many hosts

799
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,840
probably right chances are i mean it's

800
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,720
just a very large environment with a lot

801
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,080
of hosts exposed to the internet

802
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,600
and the nice thing about showdown you

803
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,520
can see it even gives us a breakdown of

804
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,919
those top ports and you can click on the

805
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,399
more and says oh okay well we see

806
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,640
765

807
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,919
web servers running https

808
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,640
there's eight or 444

809
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,240
non-encrypted web servers so

810
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,640
could be interest right and there's

811
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,960
probably a lot of overlap right a lot of

812
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,000
these could redirect right to encrypted

813
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,039
versions

814
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,520
right we could see four mail servers

815
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,000
four dns servers

816
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,600
three ssh

817
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,679
are those admin interfaces that are

818
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,159
exposed to the internet or maybe like

819
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,000
you know we got written up for a pen

820
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,279
test one time that that said we had a

821
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,000
ssh interface to the internet but they

822
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,600
didn't look at it closely enough it was

823
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,000
actually an sftp server

824
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,320
that was exposed but so something that

825
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,640
we would look at right there's ftp like

826
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,279
probably clear text right plain text

827
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,200
ftp servers and then there's also two

828
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,919
sites running on 8443 right one of those

829
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,919
alternate web server ports so those

830
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,919
would be also of interest for us to look

831
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:22,799
at

832
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,720
and see hey what's here

833
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,279
right and so we can go back and and we

834
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,799
also see you know

835
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,919
give us the

836
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,000
products right or like the web servers

837
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,799
that are running um those different

838
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,880
websites so we can look for things like

839
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,360
older web servers right that could might

840
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,399
not have have been patched

841
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,919
and we can start looking through the

842
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,519
results to see if there's anything of

843
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,679
interest that pops out again looking for

844
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,559
patterns looking for keywords right or

845
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,880
names right i might look at this well

846
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,919
what the heck is this life fortress es

847
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,440
login

848
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,440
sounds kind of interesting so that might

849
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,399
be something

850
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,240
that's very relevant as as an attacker

851
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,640
right i can see oh it's an asp.net page

852
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
so it's going to be running you can see

853
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,519
iis10

854
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,640
so it's fairly up-to-date so

855
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,159
you know but it still could be a web

856
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,559
application i could target

857
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,720
and that we also

858
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,240
you know showdown does this great job it

859
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,799
also pulls down the ssl certificate on

860
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,320
any encrypted sites so now we see here's

861
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,240
the certificate information and now we

862
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,880
see oh yeah here's the name for the site

863
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,440
on the certificate so we see all app

864
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,399
client dot and now right allstate at

865
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,760
work.com so now there's another domain

866
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,000
and so then it just becomes a cyclic

867
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,880
process right so we can go back to

868
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,120
dns dumpster

869
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,000
right and we can go take allstate

870
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,919
stall state at work

871
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,679
right allstate

872
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,840
at work.com

873
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,840
and then run that search

874
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,640
and then see now how many resources

875
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,039
wow there's like 25 that are out there

876
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,760
right and so we can see oh yeah there's

877
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,000
qc so probably quality control that's

878
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,840
another one it's like putting lab or

879
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,360
test environment

880
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,320
right

881
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,440
perf right maybe like performance right

882
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,200
and then oh

883
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,360
normally we have perf dot allstate at

884
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,159
work.com but now we have

885
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,919
perf dot easy bill online dot and no

886
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:28,559
allstatebenefits.com right so there's

887
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,679
another domain right and so on and so on

888
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,000
and so forth right so again it

889
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,760
especially with those large companies

890
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,480
right we never probably ever run out of

891
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,600
um

892
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,360
things to test right we just run out of

893
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,320
time

894
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,559
that's why we like to use the larger

895
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,960
companies and probably the less exciting

896
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,720
companies to

897
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,120
to to do reconnaissance from that kind

898
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,159
of that so to learn at least the

899
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,120
the first time right we can see here in

900
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,559
this case it looks like oh there's a ftp

901
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,600
server

902
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,679
right that's running at this ip address

903
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,480
and it even tells us in the banner oh

904
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,000
well here's

905
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,320
right the the type of ftp server it

906
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,679
looks like it's robo ftp version 3.5

907
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,199
right so that might be something that we

908
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,599
go to google right and

909
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,960
just type in

910
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,520
software and exploit to see you know is

911
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,320
there

912
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,918
you know a

913
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,760
this is not robo right so we have to

914
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
make sure it includes right you know is

915
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,320
there a vulnerability associated with

916
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,639
this software right and sometimes as

917
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,839
attackers or pen testers we get lucky

918
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,599
and we find an exploit so that we can

919
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,119
use it doesn't look like there is for

920
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,119
that software so good for allstate

921
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,320
otherwise we probably have to send them

922
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,800
an email

923
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,800
and so that's a whole part about this

924
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,399
you know the reconnaissance process and

925
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,760
using just a few tools though to find

926
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,399
right all of the just all the different

927
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,160
resources we have exposed to the

928
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,599
internet we should do this for our own

929
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,079
companies if anything define what are

930
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,000
the attackers looking at right we don't

931
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,640
have a way almost ever to know if

932
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,160
attackers are doing reconnaissance

933
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,599
against our company right i don't know

934
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,240
if somebody's using google to find out

935
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,880
information about floor

936
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,200
but at the same time i'll see what

937
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,359
information about floor is exposed to

938
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,640
google

939
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,880
one time i even just one of the common

940
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,520
queries we do is you have floor

941
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,560
confidential file type pdf

942
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,040
and what we found out was one of our

943
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,119
potential clients that we had sent a you

944
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,680
know 100-page proposal with engineering

945
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,640
diagrams and and cost and you know the

946
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,520
the proposed cost for for this project

947
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,040
which was you know

948
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,440
hundreds of millions of dollars

949
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
they had actually posted it in a

950
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,040
directory on their company website

951
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,880
that was actually being indexed by

952
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,119
google along with all the other

953
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,960
proposals from all the other companies

954
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,560
bidding for that work like oops

955
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,960
or again going back to when chris is you

956
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,400
know presentation talking about

957
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,800
ransomware right the attackers are

958
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,960
always continually looking for systems

959
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
that are exposed to the internet and

960
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,320
they're not protected and they're

961
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,079
connected to your network like all of

962
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,680
these are connected to the allstate

963
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,920
network it appears

964
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,599
and all i have to do as an attacker is

965
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,640
break into one of these systems

966
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
and then i have access

967
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,800
to that entire network

968
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,720
and i get ransomware on one and

969
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,720
ransomware on the other right or now

970
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,560
right they'll get on the network they'll

971
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,640
sit on one machine stealthily gain

972
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,839
access to the other one without

973
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,520
deploying ransomware yeah right they're

974
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,000
looking for the data copying the data

975
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,640
exfiltrating the data and then

976
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,760
installing ransomware

977
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
and then if you don't pay them for the

978
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,440
decryption key then they come back and

979
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,960
say oh yeah well we also stole all of

980
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,680
your information here's some samples and

981
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,200
if you don't want us to publish it to

982
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
the entire internet

983
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,440
you still need to pay us right it's just

984
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,440
that you know evolving conversation

985
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,599
so we have to find out as ourselves

986
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,359
right what do we have or again if we're

987
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,359
an organization and we're not performing

988
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,280
this type of work and they're performing

989
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,440
their reconnaissance against ourselves

990
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,160
you need to invest and pay someone like

991
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,480
a pen testing consultant right to come

992
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,640
in and do this for you

993
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,599
to understand where your exposures are

994
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,720
and get those items fixed right find the

995
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,119
issues before the attackers do and get

996
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,880
them fixed i would say find the issues

997
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,520
before the attackers or the auditors do

998
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,760
right and and get them fixed for sure

999
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,200
the other thing just to mention just to

1000
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,359
kind of wrap up that's interesting if

1001
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,359
you haven't seen showdown before they

1002
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,240
also have a images section so as they

1003
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,520
index the entire internet you can see

1004
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,440
the two common things that pop up well

1005
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,520
here's remote desktop which give us a

1006
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
lot of great information because we can

1007
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
see things like if we pull up one of

1008
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
these right we see

1009
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,240
the

1010
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,760
oh that's not the one that they had

1011
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,040
index

1012
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
you can see things like or maybe it was

1013
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,440
i just clicked on it you can see

1014
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,920
names right of users sometimes you can

1015
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,119
also see

1016
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,599
domain names right some of these you can

1017
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,000
see like 50 different accounts which are

1018
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,800
which are crazy and then you see webcams

1019
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,240
and if you want to limit it you can

1020
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,560
actually do something like oh just http

1021
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,680
so that's going to be like all the

1022
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,200
webcams

1023
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,839
and so you can see crazy things

1024
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,400
right so maybe somebody at

1025
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,920
you know they have maybe this almost

1026
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,079
looks like a pharmacy right and so they

1027
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,839
have a camera watching maybe they don't

1028
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,920
trust the people behind the desk right

1029
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,839
so here's an interest

1030
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,880
at somebody's apartment or maybe office

1031
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,280
right i love when they have like the the

1032
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,359
cameras where there's you know

1033
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,520
multiple cameras that you can look from

1034
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,040
from one one interface

1035
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,119
and the number of webcams is just

1036
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,920
exploding because another thing i was

1037
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,839
maybe some type of industrial control

1038
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,040
environment

1039
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,839
right

1040
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:04,880
um

1041
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,520
here's some some pylons you can see for

1042
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,440
uh offshore uh wind turbines right

1043
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,280
you could the other thing i'm always

1044
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,200
looking for is

1045
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,359
you can also find industrial control

1046
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,359
systems going back to our earlier talk

1047
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,240
that are actually exposed to the

1048
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,400
internet where they have web page

1049
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,440
interfaces where you can control them

1050
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,720
um

1051
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,960
that are exposed used to see them all

1052
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,560
the time

1053
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,240
you don't see them it

1054
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,000
could take a while to find one not

1055
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
because they're being removed from the

1056
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,599
internet it's just because the number of

1057
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,480
webcams is exploding here's one but so

1058
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,160
not only do we have all these webcams

1059
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,240
and you can see oh here's a church

1060
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,560
right or or maybe that's a synagogue or

1061
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,400
a mosque right but

1062
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,160
it's some you know some type of um

1063
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,440
place of worship right um if someone's

1064
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,079
bedroom that's always always scary

1065
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,280
but and then yeah concerning is

1066
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,240
what is this hmi doing connected to the

1067
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,680
internet

1068
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,160
and even if it's in only read-only modes

1069
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,839
i mean is that a good thing to have

1070
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,520
exposed especially when i think see

1071
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,440
things like oven control i mean this

1072
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,200
could be an oven maybe this is just that

1073
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,960
panera bread

1074
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,280
right or what if this oven

1075
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,640
right is you know an oven that's five

1076
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,800
stories tall

1077
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
there's a there's a difference but from

1078
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,200
a controlled perspective

1079
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,839
it it looks the same

1080
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,400
it's really interesting to see all the

1081
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,880
things that we can find on the internet

1082
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,640
especially through through showdown

1083
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,119
right oh and and it also has remote

1084
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,920
desktop open

1085
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,480
great so this is an interesting one i

1086
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,599
would love to do a little bit more

1087
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,200
research on this one

1088
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,119
but hopefully you get an idea with that

1089
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,880
quick start recon process we can use

1090
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,520
just a simple couple of sites like or

1091
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,359
starting with a main target site and

1092
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,800
using tools like like dns dumpster and

1093
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,079
dns lytics and showdown to find all the

1094
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,720
interesting hosts and services that are

1095
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,200
exposed to the internet because

1096
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
those are the hosts and the services

1097
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,680
that the attackers are looking for

1098
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,520
and we have to assume they're out there

1099
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,880
targeting us

1100
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,359
and so we need to find those issues and

1101
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,079
those vulnerabilities before

1102
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,920
they do

1103
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,560
i appreciate everybody for for

1104
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,200
hanging out and taking the talk taking

1105
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,960
the time to sit through the talk i know

1106
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,560
we actually don't have a

1107
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,960
speaking slot in the position so i do

1108
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,720
have there's time for a couple questions

1109
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,800
if anybody has any questions i haven't

1110
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,720
been keeping an eye on the um

1111
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,640
the track but i appreciate it again

1112
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,240
everybody for uh taking the time so all

1113
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,040
right

1114
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,240
so with that

1115
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,119
um

1116
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,359
we'll call it uh an end at least

1117
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,839
temporarily for track one and then i'll

1118
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,440
definitely encourage you guys to go

1119
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,200
check out um the talks in in track two

1120
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,359
um where we have

1121
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,240
power shells return to power

1122
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,079
and in the governance track and track 3

1123
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:10,940
there's

1124
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,160
[Music]

1125
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,440
mr kirby's talking about using pci

1126
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,760
as a general cyber security framework

1127
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,359
which i think is a great idea which i've

1128
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,359
preached about for for many years

1129
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,640
because especially for small

1130
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
medium-sized businesses it's a great

1131
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,880
platform for

1132
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,040
being able to

1133
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,119
you know allow those companies to get up

1134
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,480
and running with the cyber security

1135
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,359
program

1136
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,800
in a very probably simple

1137
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,359
straightforward way so

1138
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,880
a couple other great talks so thanks

1139
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,599
everybody and uh hopefully we'll uh you

1140
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,040
know one of the other tracks we'll see

1141
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,359
you back here for the ransomware

1142
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,240
round table that will wrap up um and

1143
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,200
then hopefully over at uh

1144
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,880

1145
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,640
so thank you again and we'll see you

1146
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,680
