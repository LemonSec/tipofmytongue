1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,000
i am not going to be looking at the

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
discord during all of this fun stuff

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,080
um

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,679
but i want to try something a little

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,039
different

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,359
i did a talk down in austin texas on

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,240
zoom and they told everybody to take

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,600
their

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,039
um

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,599
to unmute themselves so when i get

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,039
rocking and rolling

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,400
if you're in a place that doesn't have

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,800
like screaming babies or

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,480
you know well any screaming babies or

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,239
otherwise but if you're in a place where

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,840
you can have some background noise and

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,559
not disrupt just go ahead and unmute i

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,719
plan on being like incredibly

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,879
entertaining and if i don't hear giggles

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,760
and laughs i will get like very sad and

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,600
i'll quit in the middle of my

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,239
presentation and i it's not a threat i

23
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,640
just know me i'm self-aware and if i

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
can't hear you people

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,239
um i will probably get bored

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,920
all right

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,920
there we are so yeah if you if you

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,360
unmute yourself just give a little cough

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,760
like and then i know it's happening oh

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,920
there it is look at you guys go you will

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,159
notice uh i do have baby yoda coming up

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,960
on my side over here i went way

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,920
overboard on the space memes

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,720
and

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,439
um i feel like that's okay you guys are

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,280
my people did you run out of space for

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
them

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,640
we're leading with the space months

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,799
already that's fantastic

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,400
uh no no i did not uh with plenty of

41
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,720
space here um but i will tell you that

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,799
this uh this talk is going to be out of

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,640
this world um

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,759
okay

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,560
so that was a laugh line feel free to to

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,159
double just testing the mic that's all

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,759
right

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,280
let's do this guys

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,600
okay so this is a space talk but it's

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,240
more than just a space talk it is a

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,640
discussion of what does it look like

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,799
to apply security controls to a brand

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,119
new industry and so we're going to do

54
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,479
some case studies we're going to look at

55
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,920
some examples and we're going to talk

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,759
about the methodology

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,800
of how do you think about new industries

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,399
and i am going to have to turn off this

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,640
discord thing because it just keeps

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,160
going

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,560
and i can't take it where are you

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,280
discord i must kill you

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
all right let's rock and roll

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,440
okay so again disclaimer my love

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,080
language is memes i am going to be going

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,720
with a lot of means that's a good dog

67
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,120
um and

68
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,480
so let's just get a couple of them out

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,760
of the way

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
i like i like

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,400
memes that

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,640
are a little insulting to nerds um this

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,640
whole star wars versus star trek thing i

74
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,560
think it's great that we got spider-man

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,000
there in the middle

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
but this is gonna just keep coming and

77
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
every once in a while i might get bored

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,200
with what i'm talking about and we're

79
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,519
going to have a meme break in the middle

80
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,760
of these conversations so

81
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,200
actually this may not be a cyber

82
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,879
security space talk this might just be

83
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,239
an excuse for me to share a bunch of

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,400
memes i hear that's what social media is

85
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,200
for

86
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,280
but let's meet me here i am i did some

87
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,440
stuff um what i want you to know about

88
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,519
is that i am one of the the founders of

89
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,360
the field of study called psychological

90
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,879
security where we're more interested in

91
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,239
the gray matter

92
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,760
uh between your ears than we were

93
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
worried about bits and bytes we believe

94
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,640
about

95
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,200
uh you know hey the the primary security

96
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,280
risk that we need to get better at

97
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,840
mitigating and supporting is the human

98
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
group um

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,519
i'm acting chief information security

100
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,400
officer for nonprofit space for humanity

101
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
i wrote a bunch of books that even my

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
mother hasn't bought she bought my first

103
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,840
one she bought the first one and then

104
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,959
she's like the rest of them are

105
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,560
basically you putting a new cover on the

106
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,680
same content and she's right um no one

107
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,599
checks no one reads them

108
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,040
um i brokered a deal um the initial deal

109
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,879
where we introduced virgin galactic's

110
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,040
non-profit galactic united space for

111
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,760
humanity and that resulted in this guy

112
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,680
richard branson doing something pretty

113
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,799
cool which was he gave two tickets on

114
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,720
version galactic away to space for

115
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,920
humanity

116
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,120
and so

117
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,799
hook security here is the fishing

118
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,200
simulation test for the non-profit space

119
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,599
for humanity and so i count that as a

120
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,239
win i count that as me having a company

121
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,720
that is fishing in space and that i'm

122
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,959
now officially a space entrepreneur who

123
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,798
snuck in through the cyber security

124
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,160
supply chain

125
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,400
okay that's where we're at let's get

126
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,520
into it

127
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
so you might be wondering why i

128
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,759
am talking about security

129
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,120
space and alcohol right and then the

130
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,800
punch line is is that we're going to

131
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
cover some out of this world case

132
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,639
studies

133
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
and my gummy co-product my cobra um uh

134
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,080
speaker here is going to be john lee

135
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,639
picard and he's going to step in in a

136
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,560
minute on every single on these slides

137
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,880
and tell you how he feels about it

138
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,600
so

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,440
let's jump into the the methodology that

140
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,759
i typically follow when i'm trying to

141
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,320
apply security controls to an unknown

142
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
entity or unknown system

143
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,360
um our new new industry and it really

144
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,840
starts with these six steps which is

145
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
understanding the big picture if you

146
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,479
don't understand the big picture if you

147
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,680
don't understand what you're trying to

148
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,880
accomplish

149
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
then

150
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,360
you're not you're going to be solving

151
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,960
problems that may not be actually

152
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
solving the entire ecosystem that you're

153
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,840
looking at and you're going to leave a

154
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,199
lot of security holes

155
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,560
on behind so you gotta understand the

156
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,919
big picture and then you gotta

157
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,080
understand the flow of data and value

158
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,639
inside of the big picture i break data

159
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,400
and value out into two different things

160
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,560
data is the stuff that we typically are

161
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,320
concerned about data address out and

162
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,720
flag data and use but i also say value

163
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,440
because not all business processes are

164
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,280
created equal and we can experience

165
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,120
critical failures in some part of our

166
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,039
businesses or organizations that simply

167
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,800
just don't matter and then we have some

168
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,560
that really really matter so it's not

169
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,800
just data and business process but

170
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,479
what's the value of this as being

171
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,800
created inside of organizations

172
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,160
then you've got to discover logical

173
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,479
control points and discover and set

174
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,720
policies this is where most of us really

175
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
enjoy it we look at the thing find out

176
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,000
what can possibly go wrong come up with

177
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,400
mitigation strategies and begin to set

178
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
policies like thou shall not that's

179
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,720
where we come up with a lot of that part

180
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
uh and then we did the design and deploy

181
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,440
the security solutions so not even it

182
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,880
takes us till step forward before we

183
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,639
actually start doing some of our job

184
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,360
which is actually deploying and creating

185
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,919
security controls and systems

186
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,160
that mitigate the risk

187
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,080
but then we usually stop so here's my

188
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,520
favorite part is conduct audit and

189
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
governance activities to make sure that

190
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,639
the controls are actually producing

191
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,160
desired results

192
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,319
and then establish security culture now

193
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,759
some might say you should probably have

194
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,160
a security culture at the beginning

195
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,360
and that's probably true

196
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
but i didn't remember to put it in until

197
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,039
the last part which is kind of the

198
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,880
problem isn't it is that sometimes we do

199
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
all this other work and we don't say we

200
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,759
should start with the security culture

201
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
and then you just typically win

202
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,840
right john sure john luke he's got my

203
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,960
back so we're going to run through a

204
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
case study of how do you

205
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,000
apply those six points um and we're

206
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,599
going to cover something called beer

207
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,440
access management

208
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,599
this is when we wrapped three million

209
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,440
dollars worth of security software

210
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,280
around a kegerator

211
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,599
so here's how we do this

212
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,360
step one you want to understand the big

213
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
picture why are we doing this and what

214
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,880
do we look like this is when you ask

215
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,800
your executives or you ask whoever's in

216
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
charge or the stakeholders to tell you

217
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,560
why are we doing project abc or what's

218
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,960
the big goal so the big goal was let's

219
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,360
increase company morale and the solution

220
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,919
to do that was we should totally install

221
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,319
a kegerator great

222
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,560
benefits why are we doing this strategy

223
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,400
what do we hope to what does it look

224
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,639
like when we have success well we have

225
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,879
an average of two beers will get the

226
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,720
typical cyber security nerd into flow

227
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,479
state drastically increasing their

228
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,639
productivity and their quality of work

229
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,800
it also lowers

230
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,479
their uh inhibitions meaning that

231
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,840
they'll actually collaborate with other

232
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,240
human beings better um

233
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,039
however there are some risks where after

234
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,800
two beers you get what we call in the

235
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,360
the uh a drunk nerd and the drunk nerd

236
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,680
is a special kind of creature um where

237
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,759
productivity productivity and quality go

238
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,240
way down and inhibitions go way down and

239
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,919
then you really begin to hear the nerd's

240
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,360
opinions and that's fine we're glad

241
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,479
they're there but it is

242
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,039
counterproductive to increasing company

243
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,120
morale so how do you mitigate that risk

244
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
well we thought what we need to do is we

245
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,840
need to mitigate the number of beers are

246
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,520
we going to restrict the number of beers

247
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
on a period of time to

248
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,479
optimal beer um

249
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,279
capacity for flow state ratio

250
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,799
i really should have a graph i bet it'll

251
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,240
be a cool graph

252
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,600
yeah cheers cheers buddy

253
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,800
all right

254
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,720
so case study continued

255
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,160
now that we understand why we're doing

256
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,760
it what's the flow what's data how do we

257
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,279
get i know where the value is well we

258
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,120
got to understand the system

259
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
and then we got to understand where

260
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
we're going to put a control uh spot so

261
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,839
we found the optimal control system and

262
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,920
spot was at the line between the keg and

263
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,279
the actual tap

264
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,200
and we found that we can do roll base

265
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,120
liquid flow control

266
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,080
based off of a solenoid so

267
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,160
the nerds in my company got together and

268
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,920
they installed an electric solenoid

269
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
inside of the keg grader and attached it

270
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,200
to a raspberry pi that has an optical

271
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,959
sensor and we were going to use that

272
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,360
optical sensor to read a qr code on your

273
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,600
phone so they created back-end code and

274
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,760
a database that allows you to check qr

275
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,160
codes in and out as the rapper raspberry

276
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,800
pi was reading the uh the stuff on your

277
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
phone

278
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
based on the role of the users the

279
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,120
solenoid will be open for a particular

280
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,200
amount of time so if you are the typical

281
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,120
nerd in my company you get a 12-second

282
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,200
pour and we check it twice but if you're

283
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
me and you own the company i wanted

284
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,760
unlimited access i wanted to pour i

285
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,320
wanted admin access root access i didn't

286
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
want to be limited because sometimes i'm

287
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,680
entertaining and i want to be able to

288
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
pour beer for whoever i wanted

289
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,839
so again we wrapped three million

290
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
dollars worth of the ibm software that

291
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,839
we were working on um and

292
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,160
use the uh back thing for the identity

293
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,040
and access management stuff

294
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,279
i'm i'm very happy with it

295
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,959
um that's it in in practice

296
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,800
you type in your name you do the thing

297
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,399
and so we then so we went through and we

298
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,399
actually created the

299
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,760
the

300
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
the technology we rolled out the

301
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,640
solutions

302
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,640
um but if you see here at the bottom

303
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,360
um we uh we you shouldn't let the

304
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,760
prisoners build the prison right so we

305
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,200
were going to turn into a beer robot and

306
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,120
take it to festivals um we were getting

307
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
super distracted i would like to point

308
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
out in the bottom left corner that there

309
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
is a plastic knife with a zip tie that's

310
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,640
used to hold the actual

311
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,720
um optical reader

312
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
um

313
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,839
we spent a lot of money on the software

314
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,920
just not on the hardware so let's talk

315
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,240
about what we were actually able to do

316
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,880
we deployed everything and theoretically

317
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,640
life was good but then we went into

318
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,079
conducting audit and governance

319
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,360
activities to make sure we were getting

320
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,880
our desired results

321
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,839
and it seemed to work but after we

322
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,600
did pen testing and we tried social

323
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
engineering we did all your thing we

324
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,640
found out we failed literally everywhere

325
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,399
we thought we we had a cool security

326
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,720
solution but what we did is put security

327
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
theater in place and not actual real

328
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
security

329
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,079
uh social engineering happened rampant

330
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,399
where people would switch um and hand

331
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,320
out their ids to each other so that if

332
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,000
they were limited to two and i don't

333
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,519
happen to drink but you can have mine

334
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,600
too it's just like being at a conference

335
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,200
where you have that one person who's

336
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,320
always going around collecting

337
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,240
everyone's tickets and like can i have

338
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,079
your ticket and then they go when they

339
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,959
you drink all of the ibm beer being at

340
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,240
the conference

341
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,079
but the real problem was me i was the

342
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,680
actual one the one was getting socially

343
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,639
engineered and they were going after um

344
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,720
you know protected what is it pam it

345
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,639
stands for protected or privileged

346
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,200
access management right so we failed

347
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
there absolutely everywhere and the

348
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
problem was is that we didn't actually

349
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,079
do a security culture because if i was

350
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,920
the problem and i was the executive i

351
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,079
did leading by example and the reason

352
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,920
why we didn't have a security culture is

353
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,480
because my executive staff which was me

354
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,959
didn't take this thing serious

355
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,760
so

356
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,680
i did the uh the only thing i should do

357
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,040
and rather than fix the security

358
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,959
problems i fired hr and removed all

359
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,839
policies around

360
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,800
alcohol yeah

361
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,079
take that

362
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,839
okay

363
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,639
so where we're at in this whole journey

364
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,800
is that was a case study on how we go

365
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,600
and look at a new piece of technology or

366
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,399
something that is a new industry and how

367
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,880
do you actually go through and and think

368
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,560
about it most of us have done something

369
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,639
very very similar to that oh by the way

370
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,800
this is what we ended up creating

371
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
we ended up creating

372
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
um

373
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,079
a solution where

374
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,959
i love that meme

375
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,279
so that's what we built that is that's

376
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,720
by the way that's what i like to refer

377
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,240
to as security theater where there's a

378
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
lot of flashing lights and a lot of

379
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,000
stuff and people are behaving and what

380
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
they think is the right way but there's

381
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
actually no contact there's no actually

382
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,279
deterrent and we don't actually work but

383
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,839
this is i also call this only uh doing

384
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,680
security for compliance and not actually

385
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,320
getting the real job done but my diet i

386
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,480
digress so let's talk about space

387
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,320
um we're going to apply that same

388
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,000
methodology the six steps that i talked

389
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,920
about to the overall space industry and

390
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,279
i'm going to dive a little bit more into

391
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
where the space industry is going what's

392
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,600
actually happening with uh space we're

393
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,639
going to talk about a couple of

394
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,920
high-level hacks that have already

395
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,199
happened in space and why they're

396
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,720
absolutely ridiculous and then we're

397
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
going to talk about what might be next

398
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,680
and finally i'm going to introduce you

399
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,120
to a a project i'm launching in april of

400
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,920
2022 where i'm going to put a automated

401
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
moonshine distillery on the moon but

402
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
we'll get to that in just a minute

403
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,160
so here are all the steps right

404
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,839
yeah the risk culture i should not

405
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,240
forget that that's just a review that's

406
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,839
probably a slide hey take a screenshot

407
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,160
if you want it's cool but here we go

408
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,920
so the space industry let's understand

409
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,519
the big picture the goal is to allow

410
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,360
humans and their technologies to operate

411
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
in space providing digital services

412
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,040
adaptive manufacturing resource

413
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,639
collection energy generation and

414
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,040
distribution and human experiences by

415
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,120
the way i'm making all of this up based

416
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,600
off my own personal experiences and the

417
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,360
effort i've spent in space over the last

418
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,320
12

419
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,920
months i am

420
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,839
going to use some stuff from the davos

421
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,519
conference that i attended and i'm also

422
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,920
going to use some stuff from

423
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,720
the

424
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
the governing boards that are doing

425
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,680
their best to create the standards but

426
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
most of this stuff is my opinion so take

427
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
it with a grain of salt

428
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,519
strategy build a global supply chain

429
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,440
that supports launch capability research

430
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,839
and development command and control and

431
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,680
platform for delivering product service

432
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,120
and solutions as outlined by our goals i

433
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,760
feel like i do business talk pretty well

434
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,839
benefits space can do a bunch of stuff

435
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,519
primarily a catalyst for new products

436
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,680
and services

437
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,079
risks but all this new technology

438
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,760
is going to be happening without cyber

439
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,920
security people involved

440
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,279
i um

441
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
just a uh i was going to say show of

442
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,360
hands but i'm not gonna look um just

443
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,959
like coughing has anyone ever been a

444
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,880
part of a project where somebody really

445
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,199
really smart has created technology or

446
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,440
wrote anything out and then they came to

447
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,360
cyber security to say hey maybe you guys

448
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,279
could secure this for us and then we

449
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,600
ended up blowing up their entire budget

450
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
and then began to take a whole lot of

451
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,839
time and we missed their timelines and

452
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,279
now no one wants to talk to us at the

453
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,560
christmas party

454
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,719
anybody no just me that's cool

455
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,480
um

456
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,360
so

457
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
how do we mitigate that risk

458
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,880
well the thing is is that we got to get

459
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,959
involved early and the good news is that

460
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,839
the space industry is acting differently

461
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,240
we are being invited into a lot of the

462
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,480
the conversations around how technology

463
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,800
is being done and we really need to uh

464
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,040
continue that and by doing that we're

465
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,680
going to be able to um um

466
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,880
make we're not going to make the same

467
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,800
mistakes we made with the internet

468
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,079
fingers crossed

469
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,279
um with the new stuff that we're

470
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,399
building

471
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,240
but we we need to come prepared so we

472
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,839
also need to understand what kind of

473
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,360
security standards and controls we're

474
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,680
going to actually request which means

475
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,120
our cyber security people have to

476
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,880
partner with the space people in order

477
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
to make this happen and this is what

478
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,079
most people think about space they think

479
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,160
about these three guys riding rockets to

480
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,399
space but i'm about to show you that

481
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,279
that is not the case

482
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,399
launching launch capability is actually

483
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,360
so very very very small compared to the

484
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,440
366 billion dollar global economy by the

485
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,519
way i think that yeah 2019 we're

486
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,680
actually heading on our way to be over a

487
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,160
trillion dollars by 2030

488
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,639
and it's not just launch capabilities

489
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,560
and it's not just all of that it's

490
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,759
actually

491
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,240
all of the side

492
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,720
stuff that gets created so the effort of

493
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
going to space

494
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,399
creates a bunch of side products and

495
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,560
technologies and all these things have

496
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,920
different ways of working with the

497
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,760
existing

498
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,599
technologies that we have and every time

499
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,119
one of those guys touch base with

500
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,359
another one of our existing technologies

501
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,280
we've got to find a way to secure it and

502
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,720
cyber security is going to have to jump

503
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,280
into this so as the space industry grows

504
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,119
and innovation from the space industry

505
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,880
happens we're going to get a flood of

506
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
new technologies that's going to require

507
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,959
people like us to jump in there and help

508
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,280
them figure it out hey good news there's

509
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,280
not a shortage of cyber security

510
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,520
professionals and good news we always

511
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
get the budget we asked for so this

512
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,559
should be this should be a complete

513
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,440
layup

514
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,080
that was sarcasm but i'm hopeful come on

515
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,400
john we can do this together we're going

516
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,559
to make that thing happen

517
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,320
so how do we go through and change the

518
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,160
game well we got to basically jump in at

519
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,240
the very beginning and

520
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,480
i love my last bullet point here if i do

521
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,720
say so myself we need to fundamentally

522
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,919
disrupt the way that we create

523
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,039
technology in the space industry to make

524
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,679
the cyber crime that's so hard to fight

525
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,919
right now completely obsolete and that

526
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,240
really starts with um

527
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,400
partnering with some folks so one of the

528
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,440
things we're working on is some

529
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,880
partnerships with the jet propulsion

530
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,360
laboratory we're partnering when i say

531
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,600
we i mean some of the stuff that i'm i'm

532
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,080
working on we're attempting to

533
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,320
build a team that is doing all this so

534
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,440
we've got partnerships with jet

535
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
propulsion laboratory we've got some

536
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,160
board of advisor members who are helping

537
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,039
with um who've actually put devices on

538
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,600
asteroids and we have a flight director

539
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
for the last two mars rover landings

540
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,640
advising us on how to approach the space

541
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,039
industry and apply cyber security

542
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,200
controls to them and i'm really talking

543
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,559
about the gray matter stuff this is

544
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,760
mostly the

545
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,280
hook security stuff that i'm talking

546
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
about

547
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,480
but we need you

548
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
right we need you

549
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,000
and let me tell you why it's because of

550
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,840
the five percent rule

551
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,120
i personally believe that 95 of what's

552
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,480
going on in the space industry is

553
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,000
exactly what we already have everything

554
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,880
for

555
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,760
and

556
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,240
it's only five percent different right

557
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
so if you go to automotive do we still

558
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,799
have the same 95 of cyber security

559
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,919
controls we're going to have to put in

560
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,760
place but it's where that new technology

561
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,360
is it's a little bit different our

562
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,760
proprietary is only for the actual um

563
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,440
industry is where the rubber hits the

564
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,880
road and so i believe with the

565
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,360
innovation coming out of space that we

566
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,440
need smart human beings smart cyber

567
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,480
security people to get into the early

568
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,400
meetings in order to

569
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,080
have a voice inside of this five percent

570
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,799
of the technology

571
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,280
and it's everywhere so

572
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,880
you got the raspberry so let's talk

573
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,080
about some some hacks i'm gonna go

574
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
through about three of them

575
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,280
we're not gonna dive deep into them and

576
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,640
please don't ask me questions about

577
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,480
these because all i know is what's on

578
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
these slides but if you do ask me a

579
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,559
question i will make stuff up and i will

580
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,480
sound confident when i say it

581
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,440
so raspberry pi was used to steal data

582
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,160
from the jet propulsion laboratory uh it

583
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,039
was sitting on a normal network and it

584
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,880
was just sitting there for 10 months

585
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,840
just sucking stuff off the network and

586
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,120
tossing it out

587
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,080
um

588
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,159
through a secure channel and no one

589
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,679
discovered it

590
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,200
it's crazy

591
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,400
yeah i know we're getting sad picard now

592
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,480
uh here's my favorite this is my

593
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,520
absolute favorite when the

594
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,600
international space station was still

595
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,400
running windows xp yes team it was

596
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,159
running windows xp

597
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,760
um the russian cosmonauts had a a a bad

598
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,320
habit of just plugging in random usb

599
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,640
drives that they brought from earth into

600
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,240
the computers

601
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,799
on the international space station and

602
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,559
they were carrying malware and viruses

603
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,559
and things like that so for a very long

604
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,039
time we were able to put a human in

605
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,640
space but we still couldn't convince

606
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,000
that human not to put an untrusted usb

607
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,559
device into a usb drive

608
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,440
i i shouldn't i shouldn't laugh but i i

609
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
find that just like wow

610
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,840
uh and i love this last part right it's

611
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,520
not a frequency current it's not a

612
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,960
frequent occurrence but it definitely

613
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,480
isn't the first time

614
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,760
this is great

615
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,840
anyway good thing lives aren't on the

616
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,760
line uh and uh the thing about nickels

617
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,600
uh was it i got a nickel for every time

618
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,280
it happened which isn't a lot of nickels

619
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,640
but it's weird it happened more than

620
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,320
once that's right

621
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,760
that's right i got a fist full of

622
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,360
nickels wait wait why do you have a

623
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
fistful that doesn't make any sense

624
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,880
that's hilarious

625
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,280
so uh this one

626
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,840
gps location hacking and spoofs this is

627
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
this is the thing that's happening ghost

628
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,280
maps being pushed down

629
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,400
um

630
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,960
yeah that's horrible being able to not

631
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,799
even have to take control of the device

632
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,320
but take control of the gps and the

633
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,720
human just follows it on the consumption

634
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,280
side and then on the actual device side

635
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,440
um gps is just so vulnerable right this

636
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,000
one here is not funny there was a plane

637
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,960
that lost connection to gps and these

638
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,679
pilots had to land by hand like a boeing

639
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,320
777 is a big bird and there's a lot of

640
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,200
human beings on it and you don't want

641
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,880
eight minutes before you land or eight

642
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,039
where is it eight miles before you land

643
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,360
for you to all of a sudden get taken off

644
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,799
your game and thank goodness these

645
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,240
pilots have the right kind of training

646
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,480
but if you can do this kind of stuff

647
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
i mean we're talking serious things here

648
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,039
yeah super disappointing so

649
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,120
let's jump away from these case studies

650
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,280
and let's jump back into what i believe

651
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,799
the thing that we can do most in the

652
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,039
space industry which is help with people

653
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,960
processes and systems

654
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,260
and

655
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,960
[Music]

656
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,200
john luke is talking about the force

657
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,760
which is fantastic

658
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,400
so who's currently working on security

659
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,840
in space

660
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,760
and what are the standards so believe it

661
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,360
or not there's a lot of people who are

662
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,760
actually doing this kind of stuff

663
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,200
there's a lot of people who are working

664
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,400
on it but no one really has a lead so

665
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,919
space is ac is trying very hard to

666
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,919
organize all the chaos

667
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,280
um but there still isn't a

668
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,120
uh someone who's raised their hand and

669
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,600
had mass adoptions for all of these

670
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,280
different people who are doing the work

671
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,240
right you would think that maybe

672
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,120
um the united states space force

673
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,720
might step in

674
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,760
um

675
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,679
but i'm gonna pause for a moment and

676
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,159
just think about what a yeah what a

677
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,960
absolutely missed opportunity to come up

678
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,720
with a wicked cool name for a new

679
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,280
military i mean it's like no one tried

680
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,679
it was like um space force that makes

681
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,600
sense where should we get a logo i don't

682
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
know what do people recognize

683
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,360
yeah right

684
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
maybe don't use starfleet command for

685
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,240
space force i don't know it's fine but

686
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,520
the good news is that a lot of these

687
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,400
folks are actually um

688
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,720
trying to work together and the good and

689
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,159
the reason why that's good news is that

690
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,799
anybody including anybody on this call

691
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,960
anybody's interesting can actually get

692
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,880
to work they can jump into the middle of

693
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,480
these conversations

694
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,960
their arms are wide open for anyone

695
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
who's willing to spend some time on it

696
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,200
there is a huge

697
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,760
shortage of cyber security professionals

698
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,400
who can think big thoughts in these

699
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,200
conversations and so if you've ever had

700
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,279
a desire to work in the space industry

701
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,520
i'm telling you you're you're in a great

702
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,360
time you're in a great time

703
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,880
um

704
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,400
so where do you fit in right

705
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,120
well i think that we are best suited to

706
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,039
discover the logical control points in

707
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,039
sign of systems and policies meaning

708
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,960
that a lot of what we have done in the

709
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,200
past is this admin work database work

710
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
like we're all really good at a lot of

711
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,279
different parts of how infrastructure

712
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,880
connects together which means that we

713
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,200
have a gift at being able to see these

714
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,480
different control points that most

715
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,720
people might not see and the way our

716
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,600
minds work allows us to go through and

717
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,880
advise on how do we set policies

718
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,919
so

719
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,440
this means we get to dig into the weeds

720
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,880
on how every different part of supply

721
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
chain production and consumption chains

722
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,960
work by the way this is a lot this is a

723
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,360
whole lot of work right you can't just

724
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,720
look at the space industry because every

725
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,559
company is different every process is

726
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,760
different and we're going to need

727
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
thousands if not tens of thousands of

728
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
people putting in you know hundreds and

729
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,840
hundreds of hours to actually make this

730
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,520
thing work and that's why we need

731
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,279
everybody to jump in like there's lots

732
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,120
of really cool people doing um case

733
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,720
studies on hacking satellites but

734
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,080
satellites are actually my least

735
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,000
interesting they are actually the least

736
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,360
thing that is interesting to me and i'll

737
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,600
tell you why in just a moment

738
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,080
so yeah start thinking space security

739
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,159
thoughts and on potential security

740
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,080
controls by learning more about how all

741
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,360
the different parts work how do

742
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,200
satellites talk to command and control

743
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
how do we verify you know how do we make

744
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,120
sure that the rockets we're launching

745
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,880
have the right temperature and heat

746
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
variants and things like this technology

747
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,200
everywhere inside of space but here's

748
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,440
what i wanted you to see so this is just

749
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,919
looking at the satellite industry okay

750
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:50,919
so

751
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,520
237 billion

752
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,840
and you would think that manufacturing

753
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,440
and launch would be great but if you

754
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,840
look that's you know 4 billion in

755
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,440
manufacturing 1.3 billion in launch

756
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,760
where's the real money the real money is

757
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,440
in all of the services that support

758
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,520
everything else

759
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,120
by factors of math it is bigger right

760
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,279
that is

761
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:19,039
217 billion in

762
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,600
services supporting operations launch

763
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,919
and manufacturing that's all the boring

764
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,679
stuff that's the supply chain stuff

765
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,760
that's that's email that's all the

766
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
things right and and the thing is is

767
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,799
that's where that 95 is we can step in

768
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,400
immediately and start supporting the

769
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,320
space industry by approaching this huge

770
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,640
services deficit that they're having and

771
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,159
supporting that over there and and

772
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,799
that's the basically the launchpad

773
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,039
the launchpad see how i said launchpad

774
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,480
with the launch anyway it was a pretty

775
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,559
good pun you guys missed it and this is

776
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,919
how we're going to do it so here's a

777
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,679
tool for you guys this is a fancy

778
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,279
spreadsheet i put together you don't

779
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,520
need to use a francis spreadsheet what

780
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,600
you need to do is if you're enterprised

781
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,440
there's plenty of data analytic tools

782
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,200
out there but what i want you to be able

783
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,320
to do is look at a particular

784
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,440
process

785
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,799
which is

786
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,600
you know how do we do abc and then be

787
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
able to rank it inside of a spreadsheet

788
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,840
get a heat map and

789
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,320
being able to show an executive who has

790
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,120
budget a heat map or one picture that

791
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,279
enacts change in policy or deploys

792
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,039
budget for controls

793
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,200
so i'm going to show you what i mean by

794
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,520
that does that make sense by the way

795
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,159
yeah i'm gonna assume it does okay

796
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,600
so let's talk about my moonshot

797
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,159
moonshine project um and i am 100

798
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,799
serious on trying to put an uh an

799
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,559
automated moonshine distillery on the

800
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,559
moon that will send me moonshine back

801
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,000
from the moon um

802
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,240
it's going to be awesome all right

803
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,559
here's why we're doing it

804
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,399
um i was really getting excited about

805
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,399
talking about space manufacturing and

806
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,399
the ability to get power and things like

807
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,399
that and but as soon as i start talking

808
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,000
about the engineering and the science

809
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,840
behind what it takes to do adaptive

810
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,720
manufacturing product creation um in

811
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,039
space most human beings just gave me a

812
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,880
glazed look so i had to come up with a

813
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,000
catchy

814
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,760
marketing ploy which was putting a

815
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,679
moonshine distillery on the moon but

816
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,960
while we're doing that is i want to

817
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,720
demonstrate our ability to manufacture

818
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,360
products on celestial bodies inside of

819
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,720
our solar system

820
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,960
leveraging locally found resources for

821
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,919
energy

822
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,840
and for the manufacturing of those

823
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,960
products

824
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,000
and i want to do that all in the eyes

825
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,360
from the point of view from a cyber

826
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,919
security professional where at the very

827
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,559
beginning of this we are demonstrating

828
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,480
the kind of security that you need to

829
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,520
have to do commerce in space

830
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,640
so

831
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
rather than me spending the money to do

832
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,440
that came up with the idea to crowdfund

833
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,360
a prize like an x prize or something

834
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,679
like that and have a governing body that

835
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,480
has this cash prize

836
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,520
and

837
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,960
get engineering schools all over the

838
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,840
world to participate in this and while

839
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,080
we're doing it that governing board

840
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,720
would actually hack the crap out of

841
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,600
those teams um throughout the entire way

842
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,799
we would do non-stop um red team

843
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,600
activities at these teams to make them

844
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,279
learn from the beginning

845
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,399
to

846
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,320
lock down their stuff

847
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,640
so success is measured by launching a

848
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,159
team being able to launch a bottle of

849
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,760
moonshine back to earth where it is

850
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,360
consumed by me on a fancy yacht

851
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,039
it's not enough to bring it back to

852
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,799
earth if i don't drink it on a yacht

853
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,039
so by doing a prize

854
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,399
that'll create a sufficient marketing

855
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,919
buzz around the project and we can

856
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,600
educate the world and

857
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,399
of

858
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,760
what are the benefits for off-site

859
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,440
manufacturing

860
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,120
and i have this thing where man if i can

861
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,840
get the engineering space engineers of

862
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,200
the future

863
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,559
scared and aware and you know with cyber

864
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,720
security in their blood then i can

865
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,279
change the next 20 years of space

866
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,120
because they'll remember that one time

867
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,559
back in college where they were about to

868
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,039
win this thing but then they got hacked

869
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,360
um and really solidify these memories

870
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,120
and put a security culture in from the

871
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,279
beginning

872
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,440
the risk is we're going to be creating

873
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,720
the risk because we're going to be

874
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,880
disrupting and attacking them and so

875
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
they have to incorporate cyber security

876
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,960
defense measures

877
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,640
but the problem is is that no one knows

878
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,720
how to do this so this is when you go

879
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,120
into a new um

880
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,080
industry or a new kind of organization

881
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,600
we don't have all the processes and

882
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,120
procedures documented you have to

883
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
discover them all so one of the things

884
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,679
you do is you start looking at near

885
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,480
uh industry examples and so here is how

886
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,679
do we explore to find water by the way

887
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,399
rocket propellant that's moonshine baby

888
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,559
that is moonshine so the exact same

889
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,480
process that we're going to follow to do

890
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,240
some of this stuff

891
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,760
we can just as easily create moonshine

892
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,039
and by the way that's how we're getting

893
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,039
around some of the alcohol

894
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,240
distribution laws on the planet earth

895
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,320
is we're not sending moonshine back from

896
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,480
the moon we're sending rocket fuel back

897
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,120
from the moon

898
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,519
so

899
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,960
what else are we going to look at so

900
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,840
like i said we ought to look at

901
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,279
something that's similar

902
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,080
so

903
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,600
there's already

904
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,679
a lot of work done for asteroid mining

905
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,200
and there's already a lot of work done

906
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,039
for moonshine distillery so looking at

907
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,120
those two different things

908
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,440
we are able to then find all the

909
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,519
different processes that we need to look

910
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,440
at to combine so we have a really good

911
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,480
idea of what kind of

912
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,720
value chain and data chain we're going

913
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,480
to be looking at for the

914
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,799
security controls

915
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,919
and i'm going to ask a bunch of

916
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,039
questions

917
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,640
right i'm going to say give me a list of

918
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,320
all the business systems give me a list

919
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
of the processes inside of those systems

920
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,080
the business subsystems et cetera et

921
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,559
cetera et cetera so if i go back it is

922
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,200
this spreadsheet right here where i'm

923
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,720
going to be asking for all of this

924
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,240
information so i can

925
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,399
do a business continuity heat map and

926
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,120
show risk

927
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,360
and that's the boring stuff guys this

928
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,279
this is weeks and weeks and weeks and

929
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,679
weeks of work just to get

930
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,120
a beginning of the data that we need and

931
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,080
so it's a really really heavy look i

932
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,399
just thought so i i'm a bit dyslexic and

933
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,399
i saw in the bottom right corner list of

934
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,720
key stakeholders and for a split second

935
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
i thought i wrote list of key

936
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,760
skateboards and i was like that wasn't

937
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,600
right

938
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,720
oh bacard you and even your funny jokes

939
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,320
he loves this stuff

940
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
all right so then you go into what we

941
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,760
already all know how to do which is

942
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,720
running your very straightforward um

943
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,320
cyber security assessment using one of

944
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,679
your favorite frameworks i don't care

945
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,000
which one you use they're all great i'd

946
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,600
rather you be having the conversation

947
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,159
with the space people than actually not

948
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,039
and so what i would be doing is

949
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,799
attaching some of these

950
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,279
frameworks to the development processes

951
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,559
of the

952
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,960
competition meaning that these folks

953
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,399
while they're reporting out of progress

954
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,320
back to us also going to have to go

955
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
through security assessments and all the

956
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,000
best practices that we wish everyone

957
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,440
would do

958
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,399
um so i'm going to be wrapping up here

959
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,360
um

960
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,279
this the real point of all this was to

961
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,440
try to get you excited about space to

962
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,279
get excited about the fact that you have

963
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,200
a unique skill set and understanding how

964
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,720
everything works together and that the

965
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,320
best thing that you can possibly do is

966
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,360
jump in where you see fit and do

967
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,200
and help guide them through this and

968
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,720
what you need to know before you can

969
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,320
help because sometimes trying to help

970
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,240
will hurt people before you can help you

971
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,519
have to understand the big picture you

972
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,720
have to understand the flow of the data

973
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,039
and the value discover logical points in

974
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,159
the system and set policies um design

975
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,640
and deploy security solutions conduct

976
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,240
audit and governance and establish the

977
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,760
security culture

978
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
and then again when

979
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,679
when when and picard thinks you can do

980
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,360
it so

981
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,159
we're done team that was my talk

982
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,440
um i'm happy to take some questions

983
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,519
i see that there's some chat going on

984
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,880
here but

985
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,910
uh i'm going to

986
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,559
[Music]

987
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,120
close that up because it wasn't funny

988
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,280
does anybody have any you can take

989
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,520
yourself off mute by the way

990
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,839
go ahead and jump in and say words

991
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,440
because

992
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,760
um

993
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,359
yeah

994
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,839
hold on

995
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,719
and if nobody has any questions i have a

996
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,359
question yeah let's do it for a student

997
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,520
no experience no nothing still in

998
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,679
college

999
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,159
the idea of working with space from a

1000
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,159
cyber security aspect is extremely

1001
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,199
appealing i know right that is it's

1002
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,960
seriously really really cool i've never

1003
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,159
thought about it

1004
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,000
where would where would someone

1005
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,520
what

1006
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,520
when you have your entire career in

1007
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,760
front of you where do you start if that

1008
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,560
is appealing to you you test the waters

1009
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,679
there the the cyber i'm sorry the space

1010
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,440
startup field is booming it's huge

1011
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,640
the first thing you do is you volunteer

1012
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,000
like if you're still in school and

1013
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,440
you're still going and you probably can

1014
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,520
say i've only got 10 hours a week or 10

1015
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,599
hours a month that i can help

1016
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,560
offer your services to space non-profits

1017
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,960
to space startups to all those kind of

1018
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,839
things and build a bit of a book of

1019
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,599
business and resume so you can say yeah

1020
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,599
i am in the space industry i've helped

1021
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,520
space companies i understand space

1022
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,560
culture

1023
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,599
let me

1024
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,200
and by the time you're out of school

1025
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
there you go you you have a start

1026
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,560
because it is about who you know and

1027
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,200
it's about making those connections so

1028
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,119
step up serve

1029
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,240
but there's also a rabid amount of cyber

1030
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,680
security jobs out there inside of the

1031
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,760
space startup field

1032
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,079
typically though these these companies

1033
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,359
are

1034
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,960
i don't know enough about that

1035
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,359
particular field to advise you on that

1036
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,440
but what worked for me and how i got

1037
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,280
into the space industry is i went and i

1038
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,720
volunteered

1039
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
for a space nonprofit and that's worked

1040
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,920
real well for me

1041
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,800
