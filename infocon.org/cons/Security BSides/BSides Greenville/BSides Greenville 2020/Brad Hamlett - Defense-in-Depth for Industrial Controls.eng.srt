1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,139
hey everyone I'm Brad Hamlet with cyber

2
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,279
risk analysis group I do consulting

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:21,450
mostly for water utilities and

4
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:23,189
commercial real estate firms if if I'm

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,140
not coming through clearly if the sounds

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:29,420
not not very good can somebody just let

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,420
me know in the chat really quickly here

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,059
I'm not seeing anything so I'm assuming

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,860
they're loud and clear

10
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:44,099
loud and clear awesome awesome thanks so

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:47,309
so the briefing the briefing today that

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,829
I'm going to give is about cybersecurity

13
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,440
for water and wastewater utilities so

14
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,140
this is going to talk some about

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,519
industrial controls information

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,829
classification and just overall risks

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,690
for water utilities and some of the

18
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:05,220
regulatory frameworks that apply to

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:08,310
water utilities so let's take a look

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:12,689
first of all why should you all listen

21
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,750
to me well very simply my wife says I

22
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:19,919
look like Matt Damon so that that joke

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,950
works way better in person and video

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,229
meeting but anyway so why should we

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,240
really hey let me let me tell y'all I

26
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:28,890
had my first I don't know about y'all

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,860
but I'm tired of these like zoom

28
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,140
meetings and zoom you know just video

29
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,780
conferences at my first in-person

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,520
meeting last week and I walked out of

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,710
that meeting and I was like oh that was

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,199
a great meeting I really loved that

33
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,750
meeting which is not something I ever

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,960
thought I would say about a meeting but

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,880
take away that in-person factor and like

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,919
you just kind of really you know start

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,780
to crave it after it's gone for a while

38
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,610
but anyway now so like why why should

39
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,530
you really listen to me so I've been

40
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,890
working in the IT field for about 20

41
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,810
years

42
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,840
got about eleven years experience in

43
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,969
cybersecurity mostly with the army

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,079
I manage a 34 million dollar portfolio

45
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,470
of IT and intelligence projects for the

46
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:15,120
army

47
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,849
I was TSS CI cleared and

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,879
one of the projects I ran was a counter

49
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,379
idea min Afghanistan

50
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:25,170
we were looking at hardware and software

51
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,048
vulnerabilities of IEDs in my particular

52
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:31,589
area of expertise and that was looking

53
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:35,190
at wireless ie D triggers so a lot lot

54
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,019
to do with cell phones I'm on the

55
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,640
American Water Works associations

56
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:42,870
emergency preparedness and Security

57
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,929
Committee and worked work cyber in a VA

58
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,780
hospital and I ran their first tabletop

59
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,400
exercise of a simulated network outage

60
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,910
they never done they had never done that

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,069
before

62
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,799
so what happens when the computers go

63
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:59,010
down and everyone was like we have no

64
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:02,370
idea and so we worked through it and it

65
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:05,989
was a good exercise so my my briefing

66
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:09,209
here is sourced from major news sources

67
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:11,280
major corporations and other other

68
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,379
credible sources like that there are

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,849
lots of numbers out there that are

70
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,370
floating around and some of those

71
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:19,798
numbers are not not produced very well

72
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,500
so if you're not familiar with the terms

73
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,090
IT versus ot here's kind of a breakdown

74
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,069
of it there are different terms for

75
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,139
operations technology you might hear the

76
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:30,629
term industrial controls or process

77
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,230
controls that's those are two other

78
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:36,690
terms for operations technology so

79
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:39,629
operations technology runs equipment so

80
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:43,290
it runs water pumps water filters it

81
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:44,940
runs manufacturing equipment like at the

82
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,769
the manufacturing building that

83
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,599
Greenville tech has on the i-car campus

84
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,760
you know all of that equipment that's

85
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,500
that's down on the manufacturing floor

86
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,120
that we kind of you know look at when

87
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,699
we're having our monthly isset meetings

88
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,669
you know all that's run all that's opera

89
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:02,370
run by operations technology and the

90
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:05,730
average age of the equipment is much

91
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,160
older than IT the investment in cyber

92
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,488
security is typically low the primary

93
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,150
concern is loss of production on the OT

94
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,880
side versus loss of data on the IT side

95
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,709
so and and patching patching is is more

96
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,320
difficult and it's typically performed

97
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:26,219
by the manufacturer although that is

98
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,700
starting to change a bit so systems

99
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:28,940
administrators

100
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,659
[Music]

101
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:35,650
systems administrators of utilities have

102
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,900
a number of concerns only about a third

103
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:43,700
reported being highly ready to respond

104
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:46,010
to a breach about a quarter report being

105
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,450
impacted by nation-state actors we'll

106
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,750
talk later about the different hacking

107
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:53,780
groups targeting industrial controls for

108
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,580
utilities only about a quarter are

109
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,469
typically targeted by nation-state

110
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,590
actors those are usually going to be the

111
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,520
largest utilities more than half more

112
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:06,710
than half of all utilities reported a

113
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:13,010
shutdown due to a cyber incident last

114
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:15,349
year 2019 so so big big deal with cyber

115
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:18,409
security for utilities so let's let's

116
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,910
look at some risks for utilities two

117
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,490
primary categories of attackers

118
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:26,180
nation-state actors and for-profit

119
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,730
hacking groups nation-state actors as of

120
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,170
right now are primarily doing

121
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,390
intelligence gathering

122
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:35,360
they are looking for weaknesses they can

123
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:37,250
exploit later to switch off utilities if

124
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,500
World War three breaks out that's what

125
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,960
they're looking for they're mostly using

126
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,810
spearfishing to get in there to steal

127
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,580
Network credentials uit folks who were

128
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,380
treating your utilities are do

129
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,960
consulting for utilities you all are top

130
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,270
targets you all are top targets to get

131
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,260
spear fish so they can steal your

132
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:59,719
network credentials on the for-profit

133
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,310
hacking group side they are primarily in

134
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,770
it for the money they want to ransomware

135
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,160
systems they want to steal data if you

136
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,930
remember Greenville water got hacked

137
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,730
earlier this year and it was a

138
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,330
for-profit hacking group it was all over

139
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,190
the news

140
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:17,270
I was a for-profit hacking group that

141
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:19,070
did it and they I'll go into that a

142
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,310
little bit later got a little more

143
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,050
detail on that attack they are using

144
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,610
living off the land as their primary

145
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,690
attack vector so they're just grabbing

146
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:31,130
off the shelf tools using known exploits

147
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,530
sometimes you're selling access they'll

148
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:36,320
you know they'll set up a long-term you

149
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,150
know persistent opening in a network and

150
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,550
then they will sell that sell that

151
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,830
access off to other groups that's other

152
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,250
other ways they can make money so

153
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,599
two primary categories of attackers so

154
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,479
nation-state actors again they are

155
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:53,330
rarely detected they're rarely detected

156
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,639
and I tell my utility clients like

157
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,500
listen these guys especially folks

158
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,539
coming out of Russia and China like

159
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,340
they're so talented you're never you're

160
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,530
never going to find them I mean you you

161
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,099
will spend so much money trying to stop

162
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,830
these people and they're so talented

163
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:11,690
they like you you really can't out spend

164
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,628
to their level of talent on defense and

165
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,590
so you're better off mitigating other

166
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:19,159
threats

167
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:22,099
other than this threat and so in order

168
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:24,319
the top threats to the US us utilities

169
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:26,690
China Russia Iran and North Korea China

170
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,270
and Russia are the top two top two most

171
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,710
talented and again they're mostly doing

172
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,710
surveillance and they're mostly on the

173
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,948
operations technology side they're not

174
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:38,239
really interested in stealing data

175
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:41,229
skewed the stealing customer data and

176
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,729
stealing payment data for profit so

177
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:46,190
let's contrast that with for-profit

178
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,440
hacking groups they are interested in

179
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,080
stealing data and ransomware so last

180
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,680
year 2019 the average payout for

181
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,840
ransomware was it's 40k this year 2020

182
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,520
it'll be up a little bit I'm guessing

183
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,469
you'll probably be in the low 50s this

184
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,690
year that's my best guess I don't know

185
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:05,569
what the numbers gonna end up being data

186
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,430
is also very valuable so Symantec did a

187
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,340
very cool study they went on the dark

188
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,800
web and pulled a bunch of data what is

189
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:16,940
personal data selling for in the dark

190
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,000
web social securities you know about

191
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:22,879
about $1 pretty cheap utility bills

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,069
other scan documents they can be you

193
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,879
know very wide price range they're

194
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:30,620
depending on what type of document it is

195
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,779
cloned IDs and complete identity

196
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,140
packages now I don't know about you but

197
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:38,838
the last time I signed up for water

198
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,269
service they wanted a complete identity

199
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,079
package from me name address phone email

200
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:47,899
date of birth social and so water

201
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:51,170
utilities a small water utility with

202
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:54,230
5,000 customers if those for 5,000

203
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,630
complete identity packages are stolen

204
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,880
you can run the numbers that is a solid

205
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:02,990
solid payout just even off of a small

206
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,389
water utility so even those guys are at

207
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,389
risk and that information like customers

208
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:11,600
information needs to be classified so

209
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:14,269
that it is kept more private than other

210
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,389
types of public information that the

211
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:22,130
utility might have so let's take a look

212
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:26,000
at some ot risks now so so over the last

213
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:28,750
from 2018 through to 2019 the 2020 date

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,980
is not in yet but from 2018 to 2019

215
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:35,269
there was a shift from IT duty attacks

216
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,819
nation-states appeared to be ramping up

217
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:39,680
their surveillance and some state

218
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:44,420
sponsored groups were even trying to

219
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:47,089
cause outages so again about half of sis

220
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:51,500
admins that utilities reported an outage

221
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:55,940
at least one outage and about a third

222
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,680
were not detected I'm assuming that they

223
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,740
were not detected at the time but they

224
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,899
were forensic ly detected later on

225
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,910
because otherwise they were not detected

226
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:07,699
how was that number anything other than

227
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:11,439
zero so you know obviously they were

228
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:14,149
forensic ly detected later on anyway

229
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:16,189
another thing we're noticing on the OT

230
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,839
side is increasing potency of attack so

231
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:20,719
nation-state attackers are getting more

232
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,790
sophisticated they are looking to damage

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,250
things now they're not they're not just

234
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,290
looking to do surveillance so again

235
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,089
surveillance is still the majority of

236
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,610
what they're doing the vast majority of

237
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:34,240
what they're doing however there is an

238
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:38,569
uptick in trying to damage

239
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:41,389
infrastructure and and nation states

240
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:46,310
have begun funding individuals and

241
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:48,319
organizations that are not they're not

242
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,930
government organizations or military

243
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:53,300
organizations they're you know like a

244
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:58,550
private company that is simply just

245
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:01,969
funded by the Chinese army or you know

246
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:04,310
something along those lines and so that

247
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,579
I mean I think that gives some plausible

248
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:10,930
deniability so it's probably why they're

249
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,930
trying to do it so

250
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,470
here's an interesting fact so if you

251
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,290
don't remember the wanna cry not Petya

252
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,900
ransomware it's 2017 to 2018 made

253
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,569
massive damage billions of dollars in

254
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,209
damage worldwide more than a quarter of

255
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:30,820
utilities were affected by those two

256
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:33,860
ransomware and those those were actually

257
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:37,010
military those were military

258
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:39,020
technologies that were that escaped into

259
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:43,130
the wild and were modified and turned

260
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:45,290
into turned into malware so I don't

261
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,820
remember I think that might be in this

262
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,680
if it's not in this briefing that's it's

263
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,750
in another briefing that I have about

264
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,400
want to cry that they were they were

265
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,720
really cool I mean I don't know if you

266
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,660
read about him but hey if you haven't

267
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,770
read about those two those two ran

268
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,420
somewheres

269
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,370
you should you should read about and

270
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:05,540
they're pretty cool actually but anyway

271
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:11,480
okay so increasing consequences of

272
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:13,459
attacks also on the OT side so so sis

273
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,710
admins are concerned about damage to

274
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,960
equipment about environmental incidents

275
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,839
and about stealing high-value

276
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,550
information I've got a case study later

277
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,680
on in the briefing about a utility out

278
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,630
in Colorado who got a lot of their

279
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,250
high-value information

280
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:34,430
ransom weird and and they they caused

281
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,830
serious serious issues I don't think

282
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:40,579
they responded to that attack very well

283
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:43,190
hopefully no one here is from Colorado

284
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:46,010
I picked a utility like okay you know

285
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,230
what's what's the wrong way to respond

286
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,780
to this I picked the utility way out in

287
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:54,050
Colorado nowhere near Upstate South

288
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:56,390
Carolina so hopefully you know because

289
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,310
my business is around here I don't want

290
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,310
you know like say anything negative

291
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:03,589
about anybody around here so anyway

292
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,260
hopefully nobody from Colorado but

293
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:10,970
anyway so that was ot risks let's move

294
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,980
on to IT risks on the top you've

295
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,339
probably all seen survivor awareness the

296
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:18,500
numbers are very similar between for for

297
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:23,330
utilities but these numbers right here

298
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,340
are specific utilities so so about 20%

299
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:28,880
utility employees receive malicious

300
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:33,100
email the vast majority of it the vast

301
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:37,790
majority of it is either it's either

302
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:41,980
office formats or executables and and

303
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:44,630
you know I think I think the number of

304
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,820
even malicious emails for the utility

305
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,170
industry is is slightly higher than an

306
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,000
average and it's probably because the

307
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,589
utility industry is a big target they've

308
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,510
got lots of money and they've got lots

309
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,870
of customer data and so that just makes

310
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:59,569
them a big target malicious email

311
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:02,570
subjects the top two are either about a

312
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,700
bill or about you those email delivery

313
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,130
failure fake emails which those are like

314
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,320
I I gotta tell you the email delivery

315
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:12,140
failure those are those have got to be

316
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,660
those are up there I can't decide if

317
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,100
it's that one or the fake password reset

318
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,480
emails that are like my favorite

319
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:22,340
phishing emails but like I keep I keep

320
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,980
like a record I go through my spam

321
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:28,360
folder in Google and to find like

322
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,130
amazing you know malicious emails and

323
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,370
there was one there was an extortion one

324
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:38,510
I found last year that involved a major

325
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:40,670
porn site and I mean just like they're

326
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,610
getting so creative these days with with

327
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:46,130
malicious emails that I kind of I keep

328
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,590
like I keep an archive of them that's

329
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,480
there they're really funny occasionally

330
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,950
I use them I'm I teach computer science

331
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,990
classes at Greenville tech and I really

332
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,540
enjoy that a lot and so I like I use

333
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:59,840
those emails as examples in my classes

334
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:02,199
the students like them I leave them out

335
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,180
of my my corporate presentations though

336
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,820
try to try to just focus more on a

337
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,880
single topic so there are a lot of

338
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:14,000
emerging malware risks were mobile

339
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,990
ransomware that goes after office files

340
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,630
so like one of my clients last week my

341
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:24,200
endpoint detection response software

342
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:26,600
that I had I had I had just installed it

343
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,090
on their endpoints and it stopped and

344
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,100
one of these attacks exactly a warm

345
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,490
above war mobile ransomware that went

346
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,950
after it went after Word and Excel files

347
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,260
and it and so this this is

348
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:43,940
real it is happening it happened last

349
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:45,950
week too but it was blocked and never

350
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,860
though the EDR just stopped it and it

351
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,510
never never never caused any issues I've

352
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,060
just got an alert that it was blocked

353
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:56,300
and it's like happy times so that's why

354
00:15:53,060 --> 00:16:00,739
this software is great and it works and

355
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:02,120
the there's also there's also some more

356
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,970
mobile malware out there that mimics

357
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,590
Olympique destroyer so if you don't know

358
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,840
a limpet destroyers another really cool

359
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:11,830
piece of malware it targeted the South

360
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,880
Korean Olympics and it was it was

361
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,960
everyone initially thought it was made

362
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,939
by North Korea

363
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,870
but then upon further analysis the

364
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:23,330
malware actually appeared to be kind of

365
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,190
faked to make it look like it was made

366
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:28,880
by the North Koreans to attack the South

367
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,620
Koreans when in fact somebody else most

368
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,050
likely made it I don't think anyone's

369
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,940
really a hundred percent sure who did it

370
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,910
but best guesses are just Russians and

371
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,380
Chinese just trying to create chaos and

372
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,890
create problems for the United States

373
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:47,360
but this this malware it again at

374
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:49,640
targets office macros so just don't I

375
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,920
really encourage like all of my clients

376
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,750
I encourage them to stop using macros if

377
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,180
you have any old Excel workbooks out

378
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,890
there reformat them to get rid of macros

379
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,599
you don't need them anymore you know

380
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:01,939
Word documents get rid of them just

381
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,530
don't you to just try and not use macros

382
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,140
at all because they're they're really

383
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,180
not good and really dangerous connected

384
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,040
devices are another top danger because

385
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,380
people usually forget to update them

386
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,209
it's really easy for employees to just

387
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,790
come in and you know if they don't have

388
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,949
good Wi-Fi in a room they just plug in a

389
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,680
you know plug in a off-the-shelf

390
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,540
consumer ap into the network and you

391
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,310
know if you don't afford security it'll

392
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:30,200
just it'll run internet through Wi-Fi

393
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:30,980
won't rip anything so anyway so this can

394
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,300
be a problem

395
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:37,160
cameras can also be a problem a lot of

396
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,500
these connected devices people don't

397
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,110
update the default admin username and

398
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,240
passwords on them like when I've moved

399
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:48,760
into my house that I'm in now last year

400
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,510
it had a camera system in it and and I

401
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,790
wanted to run the king

402
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,980
system myself instead of getting a

403
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:58,909
company to run it I want to do it myself

404
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:01,760
so I I've logged into the camera

405
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,680
controller and I just used the default

406
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,540
admin username and password from the

407
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,860
manufacturer and like the company that

408
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:10,700
had install all this equipment never

409
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:13,850
changed it so so good for me I get right

410
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,980
in so but just kind of blew my mind that

411
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,840
they didn't change it but that's just

412
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,460
kind of a I kind of guess us in the

413
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,260
cyber security field that's just how we

414
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:27,470
think so it's it's very easy for malware

415
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:29,570
to be to use a router or a camera or

416
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:33,350
another connected device as a point of

417
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:36,050
ingress and then spread into the rest of

418
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,969
the network and it's they can jump from

419
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:40,669
IT to ot systems particularly if the

420
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:44,360
networks aren't segmented it's very very

421
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:47,170
easy for them to escape over into the OT

422
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:50,959
network another risk is supply chain

423
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:53,510
attack so you infecting devices before

424
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,310
they leave the manufacturer a funny

425
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:58,520
example of it well not very funny but

426
00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:02,030
just a unusual example of this was

427
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:05,300
Schneider Schneider inverters last year

428
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:08,300
shipped with infected USB media and they

429
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:12,860
had to quit put out an alert recall it

430
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:15,530
send out new media and so anyway that

431
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,449
was that was a that to me that's that's

432
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,850
pretty interesting so yeah the attackers

433
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,450
will compromise the manufacturer and

434
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,419
then and then and then infect their

435
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:29,810
products before they leave the factory

436
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:32,240
and then vendors vendors and third

437
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,669
parties they're vulnerable to compromise

438
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,310
Duke Energy's billing system was

439
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:39,770
compromised in 2018 and it was through

440
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,240
they had subcontracted their billing to

441
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,830
energy services group and it was

442
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,570
actually the vendor that got that got

443
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,750
compromised and lots of new customers

444
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,760
data got stolen so there are a number of

445
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,670
recommendations out there from industry

446
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,700
and that is you know the number one the

447
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:58,610
number one recommendation is know all

448
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,170
the assets that are on your OT network

449
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,520
take an inventory of everything that's

450
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,860
on there so you know what's on their

451
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,629
software and hardware

452
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:11,360
look for cyber solutions that are

453
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:13,668
specific to the devices and and boost

454
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,168
your capabilities for rapid detection of

455
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:21,740
security breaches so another another

456
00:20:18,169 --> 00:20:23,450
main recommendation is to look at

457
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,080
organizational failures and correct

458
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:28,970
those so so systems system

459
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,330
administrators that utilities reported

460
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,850
about 42% little less than half reported

461
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,668
that there's no clear ownership of IT

462
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:39,649
versus OT systems like somebody needs to

463
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:43,789
own the system and be responsible for

464
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:46,129
securing it another major organizational

465
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:50,480
failure is lack of human capital in

466
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:53,809
cyber and lack of cyber training for

467
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,999
personnel you know I mean I don't know I

468
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:57,860
mean I've just seen it I've seen it so

469
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:59,869
much you know don't click on the link in

470
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,059
the email just all this basic cyber

471
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:03,830
security training but how much of this

472
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:07,668
training is specifically targeted to

473
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:10,189
people running pcs or ICS systems on the

474
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:14,299
OT side of the network you know how much

475
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:16,220
of that I don't know not much from from

476
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:18,289
the utilities I've talked to you know

477
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:23,059
most of them have basic cyber awareness

478
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:25,429
but but very few have an OT specific

479
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:28,639
cyber security training class for their

480
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:32,200
employees which I have and if you want

481
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:38,539
it I'll be happy to give it to you so

482
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:42,320
okay so so another recommendation from

483
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:43,999
industry is to instead of using a

484
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,360
compliance based approach use a

485
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:50,259
risk-based approach so there are a ton

486
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,619
of regulations out there a ton of laws

487
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:56,659
you can use compliance with those laws

488
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:58,939
as just kind of a starting point to move

489
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:02,029
to a risk-based approach start with your

490
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:04,009
high-value assets prioritize your

491
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:08,869
investments in cyber security your cyber

492
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:10,759
spending on mitigating mitigating the

493
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:14,119
biggest risk for the highest value

494
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:16,310
assets and that will get you the best

495
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:20,209
bang for your buck

496
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:23,000
in terms of cyber spending so there are

497
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:25,580
there are basically an unlimited number

498
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,980
of regulatory frameworks out there that

499
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,110
apply to utilities you see even see

500
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,570
HIPAA in there like yeah that does

501
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:35,000
because lots of utilities collect

502
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:36,649
medical information on their employees

503
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,290
through their human resources department

504
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:42,920
via health insurance I mean it's just it

505
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:45,080
is a an alphabet soup of regulations

506
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,000
that are out there however here's the

507
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,939
top two America's water infrastructure

508
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,040
Act which is a new law and PCI DSS which

509
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,950
you all have probably all heard of that

510
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:59,210
one because that one is super super

511
00:22:53,950 --> 00:23:02,000
widespread and popular so PCI there's

512
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:05,810
four compliance levels and it requires

513
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,610
scans and vulnerability mitigation for a

514
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:12,260
weeow America's water infrastructure Act

515
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:15,139
there are 12 security domains and it is

516
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,240
mapped to recommendations from the

517
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,960
American Water Works Association and the

518
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:25,190
primary focus is high-value assets so so

519
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:28,190
it what what you can do what you can do

520
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:30,800
is you use a we a compliance to focus on

521
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,830
your high risk high value assets right

522
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:38,899
and then you use PCI compliance to focus

523
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:42,770
on protecting your customer data and my

524
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:45,170
primary recommendation is use those two

525
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:49,490
frameworks as a starting point to adopt

526
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:51,920
a risk-based approach so first thing you

527
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,440
need to do is do a vulnerability

528
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:57,320
assessment that will check all the boxes

529
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,930
for both a weeow and PCI compliance you

530
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,179
can do it in one risk assessment start a

531
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,220
vulnerability management program you

532
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:07,000
need to do quarterly network scans

533
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,500
that's a PCI requirement and you

534
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,390
mitigate your critical and high risks

535
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:15,620
those network scans are going to spit

536
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,940
out basically an unlimited number of

537
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,770
things for you to mitigate there's no

538
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:22,640
way to get to all of them so you just do

539
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:24,800
your criticals and highs and for IT and

540
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:31,330
ot network security look at cloud-based

541
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:31,330
options there are there are cloud-based

542
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,880
cloud-based network defense systems

543
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,559
cloud-based endpoint defense there are

544
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,740
lots of options out there to look at

545
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:45,740
bring in a good third party who really

546
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,870
knows how to look at your system look at

547
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:51,740
what's out there and match a solution

548
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:53,830
specific to your system and multi-factor

549
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,029
authentication I mean it's super easy

550
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:58,039
fingerprint readers are cheap socially

551
00:24:56,029 --> 00:25:00,200
now with Windows 10 the Windows 10 you

552
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,480
can use fingerprint and pin to get

553
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,929
multi-factor it's super super easy now

554
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,429
to do multi-factor authentication

555
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:12,919
another big recommendation is to boost

556
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:14,870
end-user training so again 61% more than

557
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:16,850
half of all cyber breaches are caused by

558
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,799
human error this is this is a pretty

559
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,709
solid number I mean I've seen this

560
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:25,039
number this is from Willis Towers Watson

561
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:27,559
there hasn't seen a variety of numbers

562
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,990
I've seen I've even seen I saw a number

563
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,120
that was like it was like 93 percent of

564
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,760
cyber breaches or from phishing emails

565
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,489
but then like I dug into that number and

566
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,379
that number was produced by a company

567
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:43,039
that's trying to sell anti-phishing

568
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:47,360
software so so I don't know their

569
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:50,090
precise methodology but I a number

570
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,029
that's that 93% from a company trying to

571
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:55,309
sell phishing software I would be

572
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:57,830
skeptical of that number but from a

573
00:25:55,309 --> 00:26:00,408
major cyber risk insurer like Willis

574
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:04,699
Towers Watson 61% is a solid solid

575
00:26:00,409 --> 00:26:06,350
number caused by human error and so Andy

576
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,299
user training is very important it's

577
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:10,459
important that it's customized specific

578
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:12,230
to the business and that it's customized

579
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,140
specific to what the employees are

580
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,059
working on if they're working on ICS PCs

581
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,039
systems on the OT network or whether

582
00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:20,960
they're working in the you know

583
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,570
accounting software over on the IT

584
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,700
network it needs to be customized it

585
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:30,139
needs to be role based training role

586
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,840
based training also incident response

587
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,880
plans are important new IT

588
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:38,029
infrastructure is great new equipments

589
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,889
great but when that new equipment is

590
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:43,900
installed you need to plan for what

591
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:45,899
happens when it goes down so

592
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:48,760
what happens when you do this well

593
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:51,010
here's what training does let's compare

594
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,010
two water utilities Greenville water and

595
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:57,190
Fort Collins Loveland water and again I

596
00:26:54,010 --> 00:27:01,330
hope nobody in here is from Colorado so

597
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:03,940
but if you are sorry about it but hey

598
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,189
you know I have to see what right looks

599
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,680
like and have a contrast for that so

600
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,540
Greenville water large water utility

601
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,800
it's our water utility right here in

602
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,639
Greenville

603
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:18,330
they were breached by malware through a

604
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,550
phishing email earlier this year 2020

605
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:24,250
that breach was isolated to a single

606
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:28,120
billing system on the IT side of the

607
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:31,059
network the attack never traversed over

608
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,189
to the OT side and it was isolated to a

609
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:35,980
single billing system the company

610
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:38,230
quickly switched to backup options as

611
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:42,160
they had practiced and as they had

612
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:43,960
planned for and the attack slowed down

613
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,309
their billing operations but it failed

614
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,410
to stop them completely

615
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:50,500
they still process accepted payments

616
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:53,470
they still process payments they move to

617
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,630
alternate systems and I always tell

618
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,940
people there's no such like no network

619
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,160
is ever completely secure no matter how

620
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:03,280
much you spend on it no matter how much

621
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,620
you spend on it it isn't a network is

622
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:08,320
never completely secure so breaches are

623
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:11,110
inevitable they will happen the question

624
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,270
is what do you do to them when what do

625
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:16,570
you what's your response when it happens

626
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:18,190
and that's what table top exercises are

627
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,600
for executing that incident response

628
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,429
plan drinking water had one of those

629
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,100
plans they executed it they had

630
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:26,020
practiced it and it was it was a that I

631
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:29,290
mean they responded like textbook

632
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:31,030
response and that in my mind they are an

633
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,670
example of what right looks like

634
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:36,040
Greenville water now let's contrast that

635
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,880
with a small water utility way out in

636
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,690
Colorado

637
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,150
nowhere near Upstate South Carolina so

638
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:45,700
they were breached by ransomware in 2019

639
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:48,340
they had no backups they had no planning

640
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,280
for outages they yep no incident

641
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:54,310
response plan no tabletop exercises none

642
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:58,470
of that they lost all their technical

643
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,470
drawings-- data and files for two weeks

644
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:04,220
lost it all they tried many many options

645
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,740
for recovering the data without paying

646
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,540
the ransom and they were not able to

647
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:11,240
recover their data without paying the

648
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:14,540
ransom it cost him a hundred grand to

649
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,660
pay the ransom and to make investments

650
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,909
to recover from that outage and reduce

651
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,930
their risk going forward so that is a

652
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:25,400
lesson why you should train employees

653
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:28,460
why you should invest in incident

654
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:31,340
response plans do tabletop exercises do

655
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:34,280
training it can either be just a minor

656
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,980
slowdown in your billing system and not

657
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:40,490
really that much of an impact at all or

658
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:43,340
it can be complete work stoppage for two

659
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:46,160
weeks so so that that's kind of a

660
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:48,919
contrast and it's a good example of why

661
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,810
training and planning are important

662
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,250
another thing I encourage people to do

663
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:55,070
is engage with the cybersecurity

664
00:29:52,250 --> 00:30:00,410
community that's not the cybersecurity

665
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:03,260
community so why these jokes work way

666
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:06,620
better in person like because you know I

667
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:08,720
put this slide up and and people are

668
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,449
like oh my gosh I can't believe he's

669
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,940
saying like and then I flashed not the

670
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:16,910
cybersecurity community all right ok I

671
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,620
got it so yeah so yeah we're the

672
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,960
cybersecurity communities and actually

673
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:23,060
been nice and friendly yeah and like I

674
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,940
can't see anybody you know reactions

675
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,710
like facial reactions so anyway like I'm

676
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,780
zoomed out I got to tell you I'm zoomed

677
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:33,530
out I'm ready for you know kind of it to

678
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,790
go away but anyway yes so I really

679
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,260
encourage everyone to engage with the

680
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:38,480
cybersecurity community

681
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:42,860
we're actually nice and friendly people

682
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:47,540
like us so yeah and really I mean you

683
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:49,699

684
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,649
engaging with us you know either

685
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,500

mark Johnson what's up how you doing

707
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:23,140
nope just water utilities electric

708
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:25,680
utilities are actually pretty solid I've

709
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,680
found

710
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:31,260
there there ahead of water utilities and

711
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,530
we as a pretty new law that applies to

712
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,140
water utilities so they're they're kind

713
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,910
of complying with that law right now

714
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:40,790
doing risk assessment spending up

715
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:52,440
vulnerability management programs

716
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:53,850
training program stuff like that cool

717
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,890
doesn't look like any other question so

718
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:58,800
I'm gonna go on mute I really appreciate

719
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:02,550
everyone's time and yeah really

720
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:08,180
appreciate oh I got another question

721
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:10,980
here so yes yup yeah late to the game

722
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,350
absolutely absolutely yeah so security

723
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,120
it's like it's like yeah Security's an

724
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:17,550
afterthought and I mean I guess that

725
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,520
makes sense because when you're making a

726
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:23,040
piece of equipment you want the piece of

727
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:26,430
equipment to be as reliable as possible

728
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:29,909
and churn out as many widgets or as many

729
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:33,570
gallons of water as possible and so

730
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:36,480
really I mean yes security is just kind

731
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:39,210
of you know kind of an afterthought but

732
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,160
but one of the recommendations out of

733
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:44,610
the American Water Works Association is

734
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:46,530
is planning is planning for security at

735
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:49,260
the beginning of the equipment life

736
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:51,389
cycle during during the design phase of

737
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,360
the equipment life cycles so this I

738
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:59,030
think it'll change over time but it it's

739
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,030
not it's not not quite there yet

740
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:21,168
oh there's a million yeah there's a

741
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:24,730
million of them out there uh yeah

742
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:24,730
different brands and stuff

743
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,179
cool

744
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,860
well uh yep doesn't look like any other

745
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,869
