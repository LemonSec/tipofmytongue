i uh i just want to give you a quick bit

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,120
of background

uh i'll explain how um how we came to

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,240
the certificate management piece

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,840
i'm colin basketball i'm from lucy

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,119
security and i

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,680
am joined by my colleague dan brennan

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,680
from keychest uh so we're going to talk

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,960
to you about certificate management

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,558
and and we have this terrific solution

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,920
uh for you that i think you'll you'll

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,480
really appreciate but let me first

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,000
explain

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,718
how we we arrived here so lucy security

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,559
is a security awareness company uh we

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,920
have a beautiful product

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,718
uh that was was invented

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,360
uh basically to to address the uh the

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,360
problem

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,719
of um of protecting a bank actually bank

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,399
uh ken justin says hey

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,239
we need to have a security awareness

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,120
product all the stuff that's out there

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,239
is uh is sas and we're a bank we can't

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,519
have people sharing

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,920
knowledge of who our vulnerable

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,960
employees are so we built this product

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,240
and it grew and it grew and

32
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,240
grew but we were pen testers and

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,920
security consultants uh

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,839
and and that's informed a lot of the

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,799
product so just so you understand where

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
we came from

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,119
uh we we're the company with the cute

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,880
logo uh but a very serious product

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,320
where we test employees with phishing

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,679
attacks usb attacks

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,080
everything hundreds of these

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,000
customizable templates

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,520
educate with a standalone lms for

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,680
security awareness

45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,119
again everything is customizable it can

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
be on-prem it can be sas

47
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,560
installed where you like it also has

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,799
plug-ins

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,680
and uniquely it lets you do what-if

50
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,079
scenarios so

51
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,799
say you do a simulated ransomware attack

52
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,880
and

53
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,560
somebody falls for it then the next

54
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,119
question is what if it was real so you

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,880
can do what if scenarios technical tests

56
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,960
uh with the product

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,560
so i invite you in your own time to to

58
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,439
take a look at the website

59
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,159
um all of these beautiful pieces and

60
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,639
that's

61
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,799
just some background but one of the uh

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,320
the you know the pieces that we still do

63
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,039
is we still do dark web research we do

64
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,038
find uh compromised credentials so we we

65
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,200
have a full monitoring service

66
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,238
and this is actually this just came out

67
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,359
last night

68
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,400
so this is our security research team uh

69
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,480
that you can uh

70
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,440
see here um we found a a hack

71
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,079
of a whole state in mexico where police

72
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,959
documents

73
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,959
files citizen tax records everything was

74
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,319
uh was dumped because the guys there

75
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,720
didn't know how to pay

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,160
a ransom uh bitcoin they just didn't

77
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,680
have a clue they had no process

78
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,920
uh so it's just so you can see some of

79
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,040
the depths that we get to now

80
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,640
um i came across key chest i know the uh

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,359
the founder and

82
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,040
so i use it to educate people about the

83
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,959
fishing threat

84
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,480
and uh key chest has this fantastic

85
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,400
piece in here you can see

86
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,760
uh this is a potential fishing threat

87
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,440
these aren't necessarily fishing

88
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,518
uh domains but you can see this is bank

89
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,959
of america and you can see there's a

90
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,080
little accent over the a

91
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,400
on bank of america so um and uh you know

92
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,640
it's

93
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,519
sort of unowned uh which is an

94
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,679
interesting

95
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,000
uh piece so um uh i i just love uh this

96
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,480
this

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,840
this depth of analysis of lucy's uh

98
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,200
sorry off kicha so

99
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,080
uh from there i then started to look at

100
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,518
some of the

101
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,640
uh the other uh perspectives of

102
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,440
the of the product and

103
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,000
with that what i want to do is take you

104
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,799
into

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
a a brief powerpoint uh talk about how

106
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,159
we got here and then

107
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,760
we'll have a walk around uh the product

108
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,200
if we can do that

109
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,519
um so uh let me uh

110
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,879
bring this up here and i'll just start

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,640
this off i promise you it's not gonna be

112
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,040
a 300 power points

113
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,760
and and i hope you will you'll find it

114
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,879
to be of

115
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,439
interest so this is uh the

116
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,319
the fundamental piece is certificate

117
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,599
management

118
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,439
and it enables uh um overburdened

119
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,920
overstressed people to focus on better

120
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,040
things

121
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:09,040
than uh than managing certificates

122
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,280
so um it gives you complete control of

123
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,560
the certificate life cycle

124
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,760
and so there is no implementation there

125
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,440
are there are a bunch of solutions that

126
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,000
they tend to be locked and closed

127
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,000
and um you know i've heard horror

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,040
stories of four months to two years of

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
implementation

130
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,960
uh so loose so key chest is available

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,960
immediately

132
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,638
because and i'll explain how this works

133
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,479
it's already doing the work for you

134
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,400
you literally just plug in your domain

135
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,479
you go where you have instant visibility

136
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,679
you get to see all certificates

137
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,080
that are as part of your estate

138
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,440
everything is automated and automate

139
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,280
apple

140
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,199
and you're able within the product to

141
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,119
buy open market certificates at

142
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,520
discounted prices so

143
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,040
it's a tremendous solution i love it

144
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,758
customers love it

145
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,120
so i'm pleased to share this with you um

146
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,800
and

147
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,919
the issue i mean we all know this don't

148
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,639
we uh that uh https is out there but

149
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,599
it's a threat to business continuity uh

150
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
so 78

151
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,639
of web traffic is encrypted by the way

152
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,840
80 of phishing

153
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,880
domains are also certificated

154
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,799
so you can get robbed safely so

155
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,159
one million certificates are expiring

156
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,759
every day that's a lot of heartbreak for

157
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,440
a lot of people

158
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,120
because an expired certificate that you

159
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,360
didn't know is going to expire

160
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,400
is instant downtime lost business lost

161
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,880
customers

162
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,840
google at the window and the lights are

163
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,960
out

164
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,359
and the other piece that's coming up

165
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,840
there's a browser war between google and

166
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
apple

167
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,159
so whilst uh google makes it hard to use

168
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,039
a let's encrypt um

169
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,919
a 90-day certificate in their g suite

170
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,320
it's perhaps

171
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,599
apple is banning the use of long-term

172
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,320
certificates anything more than 12

173
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,960
months and that kicks in in october

174
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,159
so uh i think that's something like 16

175
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,400
20 percent of

176
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,199
uh of certificates are not going to work

177
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,479
on a

178
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,319
any um apple devices safari and so on

179
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,520
so these are all issues and we need

180
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,840
visibility

181
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,919
uh to uh to help address those those

182
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,080
issues um

183
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,359
so yeah equifax you know they lost a lot

184
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,919
of money didn't they and they when they

185
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,000
were hacked

186
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,400
they lost two months uh in detecting

187
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,960
that issue because of certificate issues

188
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:24,318
ericsson uh was running networks for

189
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,799
the mobile phone companies 32 million

190
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,680
cell phone users lost it because of one

191
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,880
certificate

192
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,120
that ericsson didn't renew microsoft

193
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,000
teams is going with gangbusters

194
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,880
but they had uh had an outage because of

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
one certificate

196
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,080
actually we took a look there's a lot

197
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,080
more certificates uh

198
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,840
involved there that were at fault and

199
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,599
you know that uh that famous

200
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,679
browser um google chrome

201
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,759
thing uh your connection is not private

202
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,800
so that hits uh hits everybody

203
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,639
uh and uh it's yeah it's not necessarily

204
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,840
making us more secure

205
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,000
but it is a threat to uh to business

206
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,679
continuity

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,840
so here's the uh the world of the

208
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,599
certificate uh man i'm sure most of you

209
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,440
guys are aware of this

210
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,360
you have to create a server you get the

211
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,199
storage you get controlled access to

212
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,160
your keys so you get tools to generate

213
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,919
certificates

214
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,160
and you haven't even started working yet

215
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,639
uh so this is all swept there are 11

216
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,400
steps there uh to getting your

217
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,240
certificate up and running and at the

218
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,919
end of it it still might not be correct

219
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,440
as immense number of stuff gets are just

220
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,039
not correct or somebody will move

221
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,039
something somebody'll change the setting

222
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,719
and what was perfect suddenly becomes

223
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,000
not quite perfect

224
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,919
um so this is uh the pain

225
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,120
that we address at keychest no sweat

226
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,039
so the product manages the certificates

227
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,440
for you uh it's secure

228
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,199
you can bring in your existing inventory

229
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,440
you don't have to do any integrations

230
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,120
um automated renewal it'll take your

231
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,800
free certificates uh

232
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,120
every certificate you could want uh you

233
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,360
go daddy search the lot

234
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,520
it'll help you deploy them and it'll

235
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,520
enable you to renew them so that you can

236
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,240
uh go focus on better things

237
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,000
so um a quick run-through and some some

238
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,160
screen grabs okay so

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,080
very very simple onboarding you just put

240
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,280
in your the main domain name all right

241
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,560
key chest is then going to find your

242
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,039
endpoints audit them

243
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,319
get you the results uh and from there on

244
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,719
you're up and running

245
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,520
um the certificate piece very very

246
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,840
secure you can

247
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,719
bring in your existing keys inserts you

248
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,080
can

249
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,479
do the packaging for deployment and it's

250
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,760
it's all menu driven very very simple

251
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,120
and straightforward

252
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,919
web ui you're not having to

253
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,880
deploy a product per se it's just uh

254
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,439
into the web

255
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,519
okay reporting is excellent uh you can

256
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,240
choose how granular reports want to be

257
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,320
you've got

258
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,240
operational reports you've got cso

259
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,839
reports they can be weekly you can get

260
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,200
slack notifications

261
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,040
you can have different teams having

262
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,920
different types of reports

263
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,360
so there's no reason why you won't know

264
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,160
what you should know

265
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,920
before it became a problem and it really

266
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,040
is the whole life cycle

267
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,719
of the certificate so

268
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,240
instant auditing so you can go and test

269
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,240
and check uh um

270
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,440
ongoing it's it's monitoring it's

271
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,240
managing there are apis for integrated

272
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,200
uh for integration into your systems um

273
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,880
you can run

274
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,519
public and private uh certificates so

275
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,279
we have agents that you deploy but you

276
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,680
control so they're not coming from

277
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,320
the keychess product so very very secure

278
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,560
a product

279
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,640
uh the security is designed by one of

280
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,839
the world's leading cyber security

281
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,000
uh guys and

282
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,760
i'm going to come out of here and i'll

283
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
just show you the user interface if i

284
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,279
may

285
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:51,040
so let me take a a look here

286
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:54,240
and so uh the um

287
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,519
the piece here if i if i come here so

288
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,040
so here is his key chest okay uh

289
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,560
uh you'll start off with the with the

290
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,719
headline view and

291
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,599
uh it's it's very straightforward uh so

292
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,360
you can see we

293
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,200
we've got the the cto perspective we've

294
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,200
got the cso perspective

295
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,959
of uh of key chest and

296
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,240
um what i'll do is i'll just show you an

297
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,079
instant audit so

298
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000
uh let's just see how it is imagine if

299
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,880
we had a car company we had a little

300
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,519
car company that we set up and we want

301
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,720
to uh

302
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,320
get get them going this is the um

303
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,720
the start all right we can just plug

304
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,360
that in and we're going to learn

305
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,560
a little bit about our our little car

306
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,839
company

307
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,439
um and it's uh it's identified potential

308
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,800
problems a little red dot here

309
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,880
no hsts uh we've got all the sub domains

310
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,920
uh so you know we've got a view we can

311
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,320
uh dive into the detail it's digi cert

312
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,240
so

313
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,160
we've uh you can do that with anything

314
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,079
that so so key chess is

315
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,199
is great both for standalone companies

316
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,319
and for people who are providing

317
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,920
services and managing

318
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,120
other people's operations you can you

319
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,800
can probably see the utility here

320
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,680
so um what i can do for instance

321
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
is uh i can come into the certificate

322
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,920
piece

323
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,920
um and if i decide hey i want to get a

324
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,640
new certificate uh then

325
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,199
i can uh i can do that i can plug in a

326
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,920
card

327
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,120
it'll uh payments with stripe and the

328
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,160
beautiful thing is

329
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,800
it's open market so you can see here

330
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,719
different certificates uh prices and uh

331
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,079
tremendously discounted

332
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,160
so you you get a great saving and

333
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,800
you get an automated process you don't

334
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,199
have to go to your other suppliers

335
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,160
uh and this uh is just a terrific way of

336
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,680
working uh

337
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,519
with uh with the product so you can

338
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,319
bring them in um

339
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,200
so the uh the way you would set up uh

340
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,000
the management

341
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,040
of services again uh you know very very

342
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,360
straightforward

343
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,160
and remember i showed you that bank of

344
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,200
america piece

345
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,480
so i can get full details of

346
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,639
uh yeah all of my certificates and uh as

347
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,920
you've seen i can really dive into

348
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,760
into the product um so

349
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,199
as you like everybody else is on the

350
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,160
internet so i've got a slow web here we

351
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,240
go

352
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,079
so if i wanted to uh yeah i can take a

353
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,360
look at ernst young for instance

354
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,359
so and what i can see here is i could uh

355
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,600
set them up just simply add new domain

356
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,120
that's it all right uh we can see that

357
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,240
they're a bunch of sub domains

358
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,560
uh and so that that's how i

359
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,360
i get it going just plug it in and then

360
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,199
key just

361
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,480
goes off and pulls all of the

362
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,120
information

363
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,399
so uh if i want to look at the reporting

364
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,360
this is the the meat

365
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:40,959
of what i need here what i can see is

366
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,120
the um operations reports i've got

367
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,359
security reports so i get instant

368
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,000
visibility you know i can see hey what's

369
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,920
safe

370
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,200
what's uh what's finished uh what's

371
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,040
coming up um

372
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,120
if i want to request a new certificate i

373
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,839
can do this right now

374
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,000
i can take a look at the detail uh and

375
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,040
it'll pull that information up for me so

376
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,519
i know

377
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,560
you know i'm uh i'm getting close to the

378
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,240
end of uh

379
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,479
time so uh so hopefully uh that is

380
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,360
all in place so i can see all of this

381
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,160
information

382
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,200
obviously and i can also have a security

383
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,319
perspective

384
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,600
on uh on my certificate

385
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,959
estate so i can find that uh any

386
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,200
untrusted issuers

387
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,560
uh all sorts of detail here that i can

388
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,040
see um

389
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,638
and i'm pretty safe uh on this one

390
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,360
mainly because this is just used

391
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,560
for a demo i can also identify domains

392
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,160
potentially uh expiring domains uh

393
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,638
you know i'm just so whizzing through

394
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,480
this because uh i think uh you know you

395
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,079
can go to keychest.net you'll be able to

396
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,480
see this and we can uh

397
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,120
um set you up with uh with trials so

398
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,199
that you can

399
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,399
you can take a deeper look but uh you

400
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,719
know we could see uh

401
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,760
you know potential expired domains here

402
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,959
i already showed you the

403
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,639
the phishing threat um and uh in terms

404
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,839
of the notifications yeah i can

405
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,920
set up notifications uh yeah um

406
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,040
different ways different channels slack

407
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,800
and so on uh

408
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,959
what the main pieces are don't want a

409
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,319
customized report maybe the cso gets one

410
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,959
report maybe i get something more

411
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,440
detailed

412
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,599
and maybe my outside agency gets yet

413
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,839
something else

414
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,040
so that was a very very quick sprint

415
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,000
through uh

416
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,040
the uh the product it's uh um i'd say

417
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,800
web ui

418
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,079
and easily uh set up so let me just uh

419
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,120
finish this off here if um

420
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,880
if if we uh we can just uh

421
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,560
this is this is the the key piece this

422
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,680
is a win for you it gives you back

423
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,719
your time okay and time is money uh we

424
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,279
don't have enough of it

425
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,000
it also gives you um it's like having an

426
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,639
extra

427
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,480
an extra guy on your team an extra

428
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,399
person to help you

429
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,079
it's difficult to get people and time

430
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,160
together so

431
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,680
key chest is a tremendously valuable

432
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,000
resource i think you'll find

433
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,000
and

434
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,680
how does it work yeah so that was the

435
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,120
piece so the reason we don't need the

436
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,959
integration the reason we don't need

437
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,279
those four months to two years of

438
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,239
painful integration into other solutions

439
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,000
is that we have a global database uh so

440
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,240
we've got over 11 billion

441
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,079
certificates we track everything uh so

442
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
the work is already done that's why it's

443
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,638
up and ready to go it gives you

444
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,079
real time intelligence uh and

445
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,920
you know you're not having to pull all

446
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,760
that data in it's a very very fast

447
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,079
searching agent we continually

448
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,680
enhance and optimize but uh it's a

449
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,359
beautiful elegant way

450
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,638
uh to be able to uh to work um

451
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,360
and basically this is uh you know how

452
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,480
key chess can help you you know so um

453
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,480
you can

454
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,759
you can start off with a personal uh

455
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,320
edition for free you can go and play

456
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,880
with it

457
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,639
uh you can get uh different options so

458
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,839
you can have

459
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,680
solutions that will help you as an

460
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,120
individual which gives you more

461
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,519
granularity of features

462
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,720
i think the really exciting piece is

463
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,959
that

464
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,639
we offer a full enterprise management

465
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,959
piece for internal and external

466
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,240
certificates with automation

467
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,719
of renewals on a so it's a fixed price

468
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,199
but it's an smb level price

469
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,920
so the other options are so expensive

470
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,959
and they they price per certificate

471
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,560
so this is an all-you-can-eat model it's

472
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,319
a tremendous solution

473
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,959
and we really do encourage you to

obviously we're all uh running away

528
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,799
doing uh doing zoom meetings and

529

conference meetings we had a user group

530
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,720

sending a groupon or something so

538
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,559
