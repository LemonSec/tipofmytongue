1
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,800
well thank you everyone for joining its

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:12,309
in the afternoon and hope everyone's

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,370
lunches was great today's conversation

4
00:00:12,309 --> 00:00:16,869
is going to be around the evolutions of

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,680
artificial intelligence machine learning

6
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:20,259
and deep learning

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,349
um it's part of my passion I really

8
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:24,970
enjoy this to speak in this presentation

9
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:26,829
I'm going to present to you and and

10
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,960
it'll make you think outside of the box

11
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:31,270
as well as you as you go to these

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,180
conferences and I go to blackhead and

13
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,739
DEF CON you hear these these words right

14
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,660
AI machine learning deep learning and

15
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:39,250
what does it actually mean and today

16
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,769
I'll have images for you and in

17
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,940
explanations for you so that you can be

18
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:45,399
a little bit smarter when you have those

19
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,980
type of conversations at the end of

20
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,019
today's call I'm gonna also show you a

21
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,209
website that you can see if there's any

22
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:54,608
jobs opening for my my company at deep

23
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:57,039
instinct I always like to introduce that

24
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:59,260
so that if you're looking for a job we

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,480
do have openings we are the mid-sized

26
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:09,960
startup and we're growing exponentially

27
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:09,960
this year one moment you just uh

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,390
all right a little bit about myself I'm

29
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,158
gonna pause here and talk a little bit

30
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,549
about myself my credentials and and

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,380
where I came from so I'm a cyber or

32
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:25,540
security solutions engineer a deep

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,949
instinct and I'll tell you a little bit

34
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,470
about the company but I really want to

35
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:32,350
just focus around the conversation and

36
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:35,110
my company but I want to take a second

37
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,538
to pause if you see this QR code I I

38
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,310
believe any time I go to a conference I

39
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:41,830
try to meet as many new people as I can

40
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,899
so what you can do with your phone and

41
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,940
I'll give you a few seconds is just open

42
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:48,700
up your camera app and point it at this

43
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,679
QR code it will point you right if you

44
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,200
have the LinkedIn app you'll point you

45
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:56,049
right to my LinkedIn page or just simply

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,970
hit connect and say hi or something I'd

47
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,409
really appreciate that so that we had

48
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,060
this deep conversations with each other

49
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:03,700
and if we need to continue it in the

50
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,659
future or any anything about

51
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:10,299
cybersecurity I can I can assist my

52
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:13,000
background I am a mentor for

53
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:15,040
CyberPatriot I do that it was one of my

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,900
passion to help high school students you

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,570
know learn about cybersecurity I

56
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,290
volunteer and help this team get into

57
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:25,390
cybersecurity competitions and then win

58
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,160
scholarships so local to Northern

59
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,869
Virginia this is something that I do on

60
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,180
the side and that's how I started my

61
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,940
cybersecurity career

62
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,540
well my service call it adventure saying

63
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,720
I help students I learned you know the

64
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,048
Security+ techniques and cissp and I

65
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,690
train these students how to do some

66
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:48,670
basic level pen testing or defending of

67
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,600
their machine boxes and this is through

68
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,988
cyber patron

69
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,440
I've grown beyond that got a job into

70
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:58,390
the cybersecurity I was a firewall you

71
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,920
know cyber solutions engineer as a

72
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,858
checkpoint before joining here at

73
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,690
defense thing moving from then about

74
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:07,940
four years ago I joined deep instinct

75
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:10,700
and now I help

76
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,480
local Department state and local hotel

77
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,040
chains University and colleges in

78
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,679
consult them about cybersecurity and the

79
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,320
threat landscape and and how we adapt to

80
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,940
this changing culture of you know I'm I

81
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,190
have this product I have this product

82
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,740
how do they combine what what is the

83
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,690
Best of Breed technology and that's

84
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,900
that's something I enjoy doing every day

85
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:36,290
and I do it at nighttime too I consulted

86
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,050
the Asia Asia teams over in Japan and

87
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,120
Taiwan and that's quite fun the

88
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,770
translations I have to do but that's my

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,170
past graduate from Virginia Tech I'm

90
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:48,620
very proud about my alma mater and thank

91
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:51,679
you so deep learning there's content

92
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,030
available at the these links actually

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,890
are you can click it within the

94
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,600
PowerPoint but you can't click it if

95
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,839
you're looking at the PowerPoint I'll

96
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,190
share these slides with the team and if

97
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,800
you actually message me on LinkedIn I'll

98
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,750
send you these links personally and

99
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,190
these are just some other deep learning

100
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,050
there's a deep learning dummy for

101
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,180
dummies here on the right hand side I

102
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,860
can give you a free copy so that you can

103
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,950
learn the basic level of deep learning

104
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,200
and have a book for you to read in the

105
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,539
next couple of days and then there's

106
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,450
also ebooks and videos that I can share

107
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,630
with you but let's start what is deep

108
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:29,030
learning right you may have heard it you

109
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,740
may haven't you're actually using it

110
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,039
every day or it's being used against you

111
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,450
every day and I'll tell you have but

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,340
first before I tell you about deep

113
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,940
learning which is a subset if you look

114
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:43,940
at the timeline from 1950 to 2010 it's

115
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,850
an evolution it's the way technology has

116
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:50,620
evolved artificial intelligence started

117
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:54,380
in 1950s about the time when I would say

118
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:57,740
computer science came about the the need

119
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:01,390
for a computer to do what a human can do

120
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,800
calculations the human teaching a

121
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,990
software to do things that you know to

122
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,790
automate things nuts came out artificial

123
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,540
intelligence not the matrix of course

124
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:14,270
the matrix actually before the matrix

125
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,010
and then became machine learning machine

126
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,340
learning was the thought of all right

127
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,590
now I can teach computer what to do I

128
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,750
can teach a robot to do sir

129
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,060
things like you go into a factory and

130
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,880
the robot can pick up you know certain

131
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,710
objects but machine learning takes it a

132
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,190
little bit the stuff ahead in 1980

133
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:36,620
machine learning the algorithms became a

134
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,620
little bit smarter to say I well let's

135
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,810
correct for error right you pick up a

136
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,820
bottle but it misses so what about next

137
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,070
time can it fix it so they can correct

138
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,500
for error automatically without the you

139
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,620
without the human going in and doing it

140
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,320
for them and that a good example of

141
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,140
machine learning was about late teen

142
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,540
1980s there was this IBM came out with

143
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,530
his own eternal blue I believe or it was

144
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:06,500
Project Blue where it was a chess player

145
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:08,599
it's a computer chess player that was

146
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,420
taught how to beat the best chess player

147
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:16,010
in the world using algorithms using a

148
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:18,560
learned mathematical algorithm to defeat

149
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,420
the best player quickly and that was

150
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,330
machine learning right it didn't it

151
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,220
didn't come out of saying or I I taught

152
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,530
it to do something and it did it it was

153
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,120
more of let's learn how artificial

154
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,909
intelligence these algorithms learn how

155
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,610
human behavior works oh I gave a

156
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:38,180
question here and I believe we're going

157
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,100
to be tough it's a I'll answer questions

158
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,080
at the end actually you know what give

159
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,760
me one moment let me see if I can view

160
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,520
the questions while I talk I've got it

161
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,010
I've got it he said I'm deep blue be

162
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,080
blue okay people oh yeah thank you so

163
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:55,610
much all right thank you for correcting

164
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,289
me I never get these things yeah I have

165
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,030
the chat window up so if anybody types

166
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,100
in they're all I'm on mute but I'll try

167
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,679
to get off mute quick for you awesome

168
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,740
yeah okay yeah and keep asking me

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,780
questions or and add anything to my

170
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,330
conversation because it's kind of a

171
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,450
small group here so I am appreciate your

172
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:17,300
time and then deep learning deep

173
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:21,170
learning evolved out of machine learning

174
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,990
where instead of your teaching robot

175
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:26,840
what to do you actually give it examples

176
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,670
right in terms of deep learning I'll

177
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,070
give you some examples today say for

178
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:33,290
example you give it a hundred ways that

179
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,150
a robot instead of telling the robot

180
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,130
what to do you say robots

181
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,219
supposed to do this and the robot is

182
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,409
then able to learn that because you show

183
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,600
it what to do but if you show it a

184
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,830
hundred times what to do then you don't

185
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,780
have to teach it anything you have to

186
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,090
create these algorithms it actually

187
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,739
teaches itself and I'll go into a little

188
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:55,119
bit more detail and then that came out

189
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,480
in 2010 a lot it around the age of

190
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,220
graphic processor units and the need for

191
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,410
videogame systems to learn human

192
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,340
behavior and I'll show you some logos

193
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:08,960
here that you might be interested to see

194
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,820
all right so let's go into a little bit

195
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,560
more detail about the the three the

196
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,510
three categories artificial intelligence

197
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,810
right these are some of the topics that

198
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:20,030
came out in the 1950s the the basic

199
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,560
example of any technique that enables a

200
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,440
human of computer to mimic human

201
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,070
behavior so that's robotics and language

202
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,330
processing and in logic and planning

203
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,580
evolved from that is machine learning

204
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:34,039
where you now have decision trees

205
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,380
Bayesian models it's a technique for

206
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,449
computers to learn without being

207
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,909
explicitly programmed to do so right so

208
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,340
the nearest neighbor learning about

209
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,410
trial and error with reinforcement

210
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,450
learning there's a lot of terminology

211
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,150
here and if you ever take computer

212
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,860
science and learn math and there's a

213
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,410
math portion to it you'll learn some of

214
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,410
these techniques that are used in

215
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:00,560
machine learning evolved from that is

216
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:04,100
the artificial neural networks the deep

217
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,839
learning the now it it uses all the

218
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,910
concepts from artificial intelligence

219
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,970
and machine learning and adds on to that

220
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,400
where now you're looking at neural

221
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,820
network here you're now perceiving and

222
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,680
predicting the future almost and it's

223
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,250
it's multi-layered it's instead of it

224
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,800
being linear you have different layers

225
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,790
to it now I'll show you two pictures

226
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:31,400
what I mean by that so let's go

227
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,890
backwards since 1950s 1980s classical

228
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,600
machine learning and now I'll tell you

229
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,430
then how this applies to cyber security

230
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,050
I know it's a little you see cats and

231
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,459
dogs and you're not sure how this can

232
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,819
apply to cyber security but I'll tell

233
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:47,150
you how these are all evolving into how

234
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,050
we're protecting our home today so the

235
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,560
the general machine learning

236
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:55,140
approaches you label a cat a cat but

237
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,779
human goes and labels a dog a dog based

238
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:02,310
on human right the human goes and says

239
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:04,560
this this cat is able to cat this is a

240
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,989
dog because we know it's a dog you

241
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,170
trained them you trained the system and

242
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,570
you create a model the model say art now

243
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,969
whenever you see this picture it's a dog

244
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:19,110
whenever you see this cat it's a cat

245
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:22,110
and it takes features and what we have

246
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,570
to do is there's two features that we

247
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:27,720
take from these pictures from a human

248
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:30,029
perspective to apply mathematical

249
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,860
mathematical algorithms to it so what

250
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:35,279
you do is look at supervised learning

251
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,870
versus unsupervised learning the basic

252
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,689
concept if you hear those two terms just

253
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,540
think of input data is labeled versus

254
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:45,420
input data is unlabeled in supervised

255
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,699
learning you say this is the size of

256
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:51,180
this is the length of the ear for cats

257
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,370
so that's a label versus unsupervised

258
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,770
learning is you just see a picture of

259
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,110
the ears of the cat and you say that's a

260
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,760
cat and you haven't supervised you

261
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:03,149
haven't labeled it yet so you haven't

262
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,220
created the attributes and so there's

263
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:07,560
two different types and it requires both

264
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:11,190
supervised and unsupervised learning in

265
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,779
order to build these algorithms let's

266
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,120
take a look at that right so with

267
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:17,939
machine learning you take raw data you

268
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,970
take a picture of a dog and then you do

269
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:23,160
manual feature extraction you say this

270
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,140
dog because it has a long style that's

271
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,020
what makes it a dog the eyes are a

272
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,180
certain size the ears flop down that's

273
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,319
what makes it a dog so you extract in

274
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,579
that case three features you create

275
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,410
handcrafted feet you use you create an

276
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:39,449
algorithm and then now you have a

277
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:44,029
machine learning to say anytime these

278
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:46,920
three things combined equals a dog and

279
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:49,980
this is just a little bit deeper example

280
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,209
of that where in in centimeters and

281
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,720
you're actually creating measurements

282
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,719
against it

283
00:11:55,329 --> 00:12:00,290
what about machine learning how does

284
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:04,040
that apply to misleading features right

285
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,569
so when you teach a dog when you teach

286
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,519
an algorithm to say this is what a dog

287
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:09,979
looks like this is what a cat looks like

288
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,420
in your eyes you know what the

289
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,639
difference of dog and cat is but if you

290
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,139
only talk the machine algorithm machine

291
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:17,480
learning algorithm and right now I'm

292
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:19,100
going to debunk machine learning if you

293
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,670
only taught it that the ears are long

294
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,519
then what about if a cat's ears are long

295
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:27,430
or the face of a dog is round in the

296
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,990
cat's face is also round

297
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,810
what is this part in cybersecurity when

298
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:35,120
you when you um when you teach something

299
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:39,589
a feature and it catches it incorrectly

300
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,870
I just call false positives now you have

301
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:45,529
a false positive that this cat is

302
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,399
actually a dog or this this cat could be

303
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:49,040
labeled a dog

304
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,410
what about noise a lot of times cyber

305
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,779
criminals what they'll do is they'll

306
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:57,319
create and I'm trying to create analogy

307
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:59,449
here instead of being a normal original

308
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:02,170
picture these are original pictures they

309
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:05,209
add features to it they create noise

310
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:07,969
instead of it being a PDF they change

311
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:11,209
them hour into a Word document and now

312
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:14,389
it's changes structure and it's hiding

313
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:15,859
itself or they create noise and how do

314
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:18,980
you teach a machine learning if it only

315
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,870
looked at the ears being long but then

316
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:23,660
that years are now missing and it didn't

317
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:26,240
account for the face right so this is

318
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,519
just a picture analogy of you know how

319
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:34,940
cyber criminals are creating mutations

320
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:36,980
of malware for example here

321
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:42,590
this is an example of a malicious font

322
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:45,290
file on the left here this is malicious

323
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:48,380
malware you can see on the bottom here

324
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,930
it's this is where the the code ends the

325
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:54,170
malicious content ends and if you look

326
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:59,229
at the malicious mutation only changing

327
00:13:54,170 --> 00:14:01,699
it by one character now bypasses

328
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,010
signature-based attacks right if it's a

329
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,470
signature now the hash has changed or

330
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:09,020
the Charlotte Russe of 56 has changed or

331
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:11,570
if you taught them the machine learning

332
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:14,960
to only look at this row and it changes

333
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:17,600
rows then no and in this binary this

334
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,810
binary of maurer on this malicious font

335
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,160
file and it changed the locations it's

336
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,680
going to say all right well this is not

337
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,110
malware anymore because it's not in the

338
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,120
same location but you only taught it be

339
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,030
that certain sequence that location

340
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,100
that's just an example of signature base

341
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,459
or the way machine learning would think

342
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,460
about it

343
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:42,530
so yeah one byte offsets completely

344
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,710
changes the verdict so why not let a

345
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,990
model decide on features and and that's

346
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:53,680
that's now we're moving into the

347
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:56,240
generations of 2010 deep learning so now

348
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,180
deep learning is very similar to the way

349
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,880
the brain works training the brain and

350
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,829
when you teach a child the difference

351
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,290
between a dog and a cat you don't teach

352
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:11,570
it based on features you teach it

353
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:13,430
based on examples in a lot of examples

354
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,500
every time you walk your your child down

355
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,540
the street and you see a dog you point

356
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,990
out that dog and say that's a dog next

357
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,810
time you go to a dog park and you say

358
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,540
those are all dogs your child is then

359
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,969
able to quickly learn through examples

360
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,680
that that's going to be a dog and then

361
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,180
you teach it for the cat and now it's

362
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,780
able to differentiate different trees

363
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:38,780
all in a Canon and even the fact that

364
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,550
you can look at different types of dogs

365
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,319
this is a chihuahua this is a small dog

366
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,900
versus big dog this is all that you

367
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,700
should stay away from right so the

368
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,620
detection becomes instinctual and that's

369
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,830
now we're applying that to cybersecurity

370
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:54,770
where we're creating artificial brain

371
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:57,290
this is artificial brain by deep

372
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,780
learning is very similar the way the

373
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,910
human brain works so you have in human

374
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,160
brain stoma and then dry sand axons and

375
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:08,000
internal moles and the synapses that

376
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,130
teach you know the behavior of you know

377
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,870
something hurts or you see a dog and a

378
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:16,160
cat changes different parts of your

379
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:18,170
brain smells and everything well the

380
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,540
neural network is very similar you

381
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,490
create a lot of inputs you put weights

382
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,880
to it saying is this right or this wrong

383
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:27,830
and then you create a output to say

384
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,750
based on what I've learned before and

385
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,480
all the inputs the millions of inputs

386
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,770
that I've received creates an output of

387
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,430
this is what it is

388
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:39,790
this is what I perceive it is and it

389
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,319
requires all the supervised unsupervised

390
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,930
layers and the neural network and I'll

391
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,089
go into loving more detail them on these

392
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:52,519
four topics so

393
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:55,850
leave learning is not a marketing term

394
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:58,610
it's actually something that came out

395
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,259
first publications in the 1960s and

396
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,740
2000's if you actually look up deep

397
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:04,130
learning

398
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:08,949
an example is Cova 19 they're using deep

399
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:14,929
learning to correlate early detection of

400
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:16,939
the lungs x-rays of lungs in pictures of

401
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:19,929
lungs and the computer is able to say

402
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:23,000
with a high I think 90 plus percent

403
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:26,390
efficacy that this lung is going is

404
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,450
covert versus a flu or influenza based

405
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,640
on how the virus is impacting this

406
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,919
person's lungs and this is using deep

407
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,860
learning some just it's impacting the

408
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,299
medical industry it's it's also now

409
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,899
applied to cybersecurity

410
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:44,480
so there's theoretical advances and in

411
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:46,639
1990s a lot of labeled data sets this

412
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,289
requires a lot of data right it's not

413
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,750
something that you could say based on

414
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:52,490
five samples I can make correlation it's

415
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:57,320
more like five thousand or five million

416
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:59,539
and it's done by data Sciences so it

417
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:03,020
requires a lot of GPU computing around

418
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:06,919
the time of you know when graphics

419
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:09,620
processors became very very powerful I

420
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,890
would say Nvidia and AMD and all those

421
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,239
companies have crazies these the the

422
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,860
most powerful part of your computer is

423
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,470
your GPU if you have a nice one

424
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,750
and that GPU can crunch a lot of data

425
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,450
and we're utilizing the GPU to crunch

426
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:25,549
all these mowers mom our samples and in

427
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,380
the scientists are crunching all the

428
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:30,200
data from their research studies to

429
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,320
create algorithms instead of having to

430
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:36,440
create algorithms themselves and in 2008

431
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,129
open source frameworks you create these

432
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,590
frameworks

433
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,659
I think there's five main frameworks for

434
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,860
deep learning and and my company I'm

435
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:47,059
proud to say we created our own

436
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:49,330
framework for cybersecurity all right so

437
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,320
let's review a little bit um okay so

438
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,240
let's review a little bit about deep

439
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,590
learning versus machine learning on the

440
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,610
top is machine learning you have the raw

441
00:18:54,590 --> 00:19:01,760
data you have manual feature engineering

442
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:03,860
right so you have a person to say this

443
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,260
is what malware is this is what malware

444
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,780
isn't

445
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,879
because of these 10 things you create an

446
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,980
algorithm it could be mathematical it

447
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,040
could be theoretical and and then you

448
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,560
create a machine learning algorithm

449
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,980
right but deep learning is different

450
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,110
instead of doing instead of having a

451
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,750
human come in in human being in the

452
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:27,000
picture it just takes the raw data it

453
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,700
takes hundreds of pictures of those cats

454
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,890
and dogs you tell it what the difference

455
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,250
is organic cat is and then it's able to

456
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,730
learn based on examples or malware you

457
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,130
give it

458
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,800
millions of malware samples looked at

459
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,350
the binaries and then is able to then

460
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,500
create this correlation to say based on

461
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:49,110
the binaries based on the core of a

462
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,940
program of a Mauer and we've trained it

463
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,159
there's these millions of ways that

464
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:56,160
these mutations that could happen that

465
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,920
we can we can actually identify it as

466
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:03,230
malware and and quickly to so it it's

467
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,230
much quicker to use deep learning

468
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:08,460
and here's a little bit more difference

469
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,260
between machine learning and applying

470
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,610
because it requires that human

471
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,910
interaction a human can only tell what

472
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,520
they see

473
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,990
right they only can tell what the

474
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,660
picture of the dog and the cat looks

475
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,330
like and the features of it and the only

476
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,400
attract extracts certain features and

477
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,199
this is a really only utilizing two

478
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,390
percent of the data if you have am our

479
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,170
sample for example that is that is a

480
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:36,240
safe example ten megabytes it is a human

481
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,700
able to analyze every single bit of the

482
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,890
code in that ten megabytes effectively

483
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,830
and and we've tested it and said no

484
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,750
because humans have you know time it

485
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:48,240
takes too much time or they have to work

486
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,940
on different projects and in they had to

487
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,640
prioritize certain parts of the sum our

488
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,010
sample we're deep learning at the bottom

489
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,960
here you feed it a hundred percent of

490
00:20:56,010 --> 00:21:02,730
the data and it's able to create an

491
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:05,040
autonomous intuitive automated nonlinear

492
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:07,500
model of correlation right so now it's

493
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,870
not from A to B or A to C there's

494
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:15,270
actually a three dimensional way that we

495
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:17,909
look at mauers in our code and also

496
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:20,160
machine learning limited to certain file

497
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:22,350
types if you look at total executables

498
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,240
or only to look at documents you only

499
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,820
categorize you know what the latest

500
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,950
threats are for PDF files for example

501
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,510
it's it's it's really going to be

502
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,370
limited your machine learnings enemy

503
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:35,490
limited the file types that you can

504
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:39,330
train the human has a train versus what

505
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,760
deep learning you give it a million font

506
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,500
files benign and malicious and is able

507
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,260
to tell the difference between what's

508
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,090
what's Delta right what is the mutated

509
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:51,230
one what is the one that includes a

510
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,230
ransomware inside of it

511
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:58,370
and this is just reviewing the debunking

512
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,799
machine learning in that not debugging

513
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,290
machine learning is great it's it's good

514
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,389
with his uses but again it's just the

515
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,490
limited human knowledge and expertise

516
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:10,760
right you can only human only goes

517
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:13,150
through and looks at the part of the 10

518
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:16,760
megabyte file versus the full raw data

519
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:20,090
and then mutations if you only teach it

520
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:22,160
one way to look at malware or ten ways

521
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:27,399
to look at malware what about the 11 or

522
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,400
the 20th or the hundredth mutation of it

523
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,980
and here's a nice picture here to

524
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,389
summarize what I was talking about this

525
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,410
is the way the human looks at a file

526
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:39,400
right you write code line by line you

527
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,230
highlight when I was an engineer a

528
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,590
reverse engineer I would highlight

529
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:47,950
things that would make the anomalies

530
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,780
look malicious they're the ones that I

531
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,050
think that this is calling out to a

532
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,240
command and control server or something

533
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:58,270
but deep learning has made it so much

534
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,720
more simple I just feed a bunch of these

535
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:04,410
files into my model set and it's been

536
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:08,530
able to say based on a hundred samples

537
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:09,970
this is 90 percent ransomware and it's

538
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:14,350
able to categorize and tell me what

539
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:16,150
malware is and isn't so in that case I'm

540
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:19,540
feeding it a hundred percent of the data

541
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:24,880
its autonomous it's automating my my um

542
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:27,520
my my data sets and categorizing it and

543
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,970
I'm able to train it on the unlimited

544
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,280
training samples and apply the inputs

545
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,560
from many different types of devices so

546
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,160
there's different operating system

547
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:42,490
agnostic so you can actually learn

548
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:45,700
malware in any type of operating system

549
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:48,250
including Android phones right we have a

550
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:51,490
lot of malicious apps that we're looking

551
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:54,010
at and we have a lot of apps in or

552
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,960
Google Playstore even Chromebooks that

553
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,520
we're looking at and we're feeding this

554
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,120
neural network of all the malicious

555
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,830
things and then and then taking out

556
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:08,080
protections and prevention capabilities

557
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:10,330
against it more statistics this year on

558
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,699
the top is machine learning the accuracy

559
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:15,389
with unknown malware so this is actually

560
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,070
with known malware machine learning

561
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:20,410
signature-based can protect unknown

562
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,820
malware where it's mutated and new and

563
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,590
actually if I have some time today I'll

564
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,840
show you an example of some unknown

565
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:28,810
malware and I'll execute it on a

566
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,610
computer to show you that with deep

567
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,440
learning you can actually prevent an

568
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,469
unknown malware in fact I'm a mutated

569
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,290
one so with that you could see with

570
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:41,490
accuracy is 99% and very low false

571
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:43,020
positives with deep learning

572
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,929
so here's some real-world applications

573
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:50,220
of deep learning you might see here some

574
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:53,100
familiar I know you know these logos but

575
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:56,700
let me just show you one facial

576
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:59,750
recognition by Facebook at five or ten

577
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,789
years ago Facebook wasn't really able to

578
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:05,309
do really good their image recognition

579
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:08,460
was very subpar it was it was used

580
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:11,760
uploaded a picture and based on location

581
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,470
or based on your friends list they were

582
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,960
able to categorize and say that could be

583
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:19,320
you but now image recognition has done

584
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,960
so much advanced it has advanced so much

585
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,750
that now with even a picture I have a

586
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,179
hat on and if I'll upload my picture

587
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,130
right now to Facebook you'll actually be

588
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:32,340
able to tell me that that is me and not

589
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:34,380
my cousin or not my brother oh and even

590
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,240
your friends right if you have a picture

591
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,029
of a group of 10 people and they only

592
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,490
see like one part of your face the image

593
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:44,039
recognition using deep learning is able

594
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,870
to to say are well based on the

595
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:48,480
percentage we're going to say this we're

596
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:51,750
going to tag this friend in your picture

597
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,240
in that's advanced so much now the deep

598
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,490
learning is involved it's trained on

599
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,470
your pictures it trains on your in and

600
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,789
now Facebook has there's neural network

601
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,000
of all your pictures and the pictures

602
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:04,799
around the world and it can correlate

603
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,200
without using the small features like

604
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,870
geolocation and that being your friend

605
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,760
is able to correlate based on part of

606
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,649
your face or even bottom of your nose

607
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,470
and it's doing that in image recognition

608
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:18,449
in many ways and Netflix right able to

609
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:21,870
do recommendation systems and learn your

610
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:24,600
behaviors the highlight deep learning

611
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,939
deep cybersecurity deep instinct is the

612
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,189
first and only and this is my company

613
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,620
and and I want to represent my the data

614
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,049
Sciences engineers who created on via

615
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:36,989
this cybersecurity platform where were

616
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:39,510
the first and only cybersecurity to

617
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,960
provide end-to-end protection with deep

618
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,940
learning

619
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,730
utilizing deep learning neural networks

620
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:49,070
to prevent cyber attacks nuts

621
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,070
that's quite an app eat

622
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,130
in many ways 90% in computer vision

623
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:57,280
speech recognition you go through Google

624
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:59,679
Translate in able to actually caption

625
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,770
your voice and caption the translation

626
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,730
of of what you're trying to catch

627
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,980
utilizing deep learning and if you

628
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:08,890
actually look at jobs you go to Facebook

629
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,750
jobs or Google jobs or even Tesla I'm

630
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:13,120
not we're not affiliated with them by

631
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,740
just one say for example like Tesla and

632
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,600
you look up deep learning you'll see

633
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:20,260
that you know they require some of those

634
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,780
those that knowledge of deep learning in

635
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,629
order to produce their algorithms for

636
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:29,080
you're looking at stop signs and in an

637
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,970
image recognition it's not so much using

638
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,230
cybersecurity yet so we're actually a

639
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:36,820
new frontier only two percent of

640
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:39,220
companies are utilizing deep learning

641
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:42,490
today and so it's it's an open market

642
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,780
for for cyber security and there's a lot

643
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,030
of traditional machine learning right

644
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,820
feature extraction but this pure deep

645
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:54,549
learning is only um it's very new and

646
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:56,918
I'm proud to be part of the frontier so

647
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:59,410
the benefits of deep learning to cyber

648
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:01,090
security which is B side so let's talk a

649
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:03,940
little bit cyber right prediction of

650
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:05,860
unknown threats zero time detection and

651
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,940
prevention and I'll have some time today

652
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,159
it looks like we have about 15 minutes

653
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,679
left I'm actually going to show you an

654
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:15,220
example of zero time detection and

655
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:18,610
prevention of unknown malware or zero

656
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,530
you're a time malware yeah sorry not I

657
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:24,549
know it's going to be malware that is

658
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:27,910
found within the last 12 hours yeah

659
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:30,040
and it's it's cross device multi

660
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:32,770
operation system so as you saw on my

661
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,470
maybe three four slides ago there was

662
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:37,809
some it's vendor its operating so big

663
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:39,880
agnostic so we've trained this brain

664
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:42,040
that's now sits on your computer your

665
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,150
desktop or laptop utilizing deep

666
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,190
learning to protect against cyber

667
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:47,590
attacks and it doesn't require any

668
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,480
internet connectivity so you can have

669
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:52,510
protections on your computer without

670
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,440
having to have connectivity to a cloud

671
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:57,520
server you can if Kent connectionless

672
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,130
because your brain your brain doesn't

673
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,408
actually it doesn't get information from

674
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,370
an external source it's everything in

675
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:06,280
here it's in your noggin

676
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,020
right that's deep instinct in deep

677
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,940
learning it's everything is now on the

678
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,010
computer it's like an analyst that

679
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,730
checks everything for you as it gets

680
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,730
written to disk

681
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,870
in here pom this is a good one and then

682
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,720
this is what I'm going in my last slide

683
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:23,550
before I I show you some examples let's

684
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,430
show you the way that deep instinct has

685
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:30,899
applied deep learning from training to

686
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:33,040
prediction to response so it starts off

687
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:36,010
with

688
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,540
malware third party sources dark net

689
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,270
homemade malware mutated malware

690
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,790
millions of malware in malware file

691
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,860
types executables PowerPoint Excel

692
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,960
essence and as you saw on my previous

693
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,939
light where where human has to go in and

694
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,740
highlight all the malicious parts of a

695
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,380
word document and then create a

696
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,300
signature for it if we're just giving

697
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,250
them files we just give this neural

698
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,350
network all the files and it's able to

699
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,350
crunch it and say based on these million

700
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,659
files are merely a 10,000 of them were

701
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,899
malicious and what of the 10,000

702
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:10,210
malicious ones are makes it malicious

703
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:14,620
and then it creates this whole Pro

704
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:16,060
pattern of our samples in be able to

705
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,340
predict alright well let's give it

706
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:22,300
another it's give it a separate sample

707
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:24,280
set it's that bird sample set of another

708
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,840
hundred thousand mile where do we see

709
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,250
some similarities between the first

710
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,419
sample said and the second sample said

711
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:32,920
and then creating correlation against

712
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,720
that and creating another algorithm or

713
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,120
another pattern a deep learning brain

714
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,010
right and you just teach it this way

715
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,020
hopefully that's clear I'll pause a

716
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:43,750
little bit for you guys to kind of read

717
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,330
through this so it requires a lot of

718
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:49,060
these data sampling supervised training

719
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:50,740
and creating noise you know mutating

720
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,810
malware tweaking a little bit maybe

721
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:57,400
adding a different line and then and

722
00:30:52,810 --> 00:31:01,389
then going with with the protections and

723
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:03,700
engines through this deep neural network

724
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:06,070
we retrain it through NVIDIA GPUs so

725
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,590
Nvidia is one of our our partners that

726
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:12,639
we use their business GP years not those

727
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:15,340
you know 1080p eyes or the 220 atti

728
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:19,450
super 2080 super now I think it's the

729
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:24,240
best one for consumer base I'm a I like

730
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:27,790
the game okay I like the game a lot but

731
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,800
so 2020 80 those our consumer base but

732
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,899
then they have these business grade GPUs

733
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,120
actually did sit in the data and via

734
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,070
data centers that we we partner up and

735
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,159
we train our brain and our neural

736
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,290
network with their GPUs and his own can

737
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,710
be done on GPUs because of how much data

738
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:46,649
that's being added to it once it's

739
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:51,269
trained

740
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:54,178
takes about 24 hours a train its then

741
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:57,399
then we create these petabytes of data

742
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:58,929
into one single agent and this is where

743
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:01,899
defensing is we are an endpoint security

744
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:04,799
company we provide endpoint security on

745
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:07,539
devices laptops desktops mobile devices

746
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,759
and we look at any file any device any

747
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:12,009
OS and it's a lightweight agent that

748
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,889
runs on any very low CPU and only

749
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:16,570
requires two updates a year so this is a

750
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:19,899
deep instincts you know that's our

751
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:22,269
market it's the threat prevention threat

752
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:25,570
detection in response or predict and

753
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:27,099
respond it requires only two updates a

754
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:31,029
year and that's that's actually pretty

755
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:32,589
powerful because if you think of it how

756
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:34,149
many times you have to teach your brain

757
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:35,918
what the difference between a dog and a

758
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:37,539
cat is you'll have to teach it anymore

759
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,419
because you already learned it ten years

760
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,408
ago or twenty or thirty years ago same

761
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:42,070
thing for the brain you've already

762
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:44,229
taught it

763
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:46,299
what malware binary looks like and then

764
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:48,489
what malware binaries could be mutated

765
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:50,049
to look like in the future then you

766
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:52,359
don't really need to have signature so

767
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:55,029
it doesn't require signatures it just

768
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:57,718
requires a new brain so we update the

769
00:32:55,029 --> 00:33:01,779
brain two times a year

770
00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:04,539
so with that is there any questions um

771
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:07,119
before I start I'll do a little demo so

772
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:10,679
that you can see this in action but any

773
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:13,658
questions so far if I intrigued you guys

774
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:20,709
based on the topic today yep so we do

775
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:23,019
have something that has come in to us we

776
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:27,309
have seen stories of bias in learned

777
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:29,979
algorithms ie mortgage decisions main

778
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:32,259
maintained racial bias from the people

779
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:36,749
that were watched or computers seen so

780
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:39,369
many pictures that they assume coolers

781
00:33:36,749 --> 00:33:42,969
coders are men and women who are in the

782
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:44,939
kitchen are you seeing that bias in the

783
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:47,859
learning in in the cybersecurity

784
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,209
implementations examples and how to fix

785
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:52,478
them

786
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:54,759
yeah yeah yeah there's bias

787
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:56,259
yeah bias comes from the human yeah

788
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,419
there's a lot of it even in deep

789
00:33:56,259 --> 00:34:00,429
learning I can say that bias is always

790
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:02,649
added by the way you train it the

791
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:06,429
weights that you put on it so there are

792
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:09,038
examples so say for example let me show

793
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:11,079
you here I don't have a picture but is

794
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:15,250
to kind of put into perspective if you

795
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:17,169
teach malware too much if you teach the

796
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:19,359
known networks too many times and you

797
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:21,730
teach it too many malware samples what

798
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:25,268
will happen is then you'll get another

799
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:26,799
neural network that only learns on I

800
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:28,029
only can find malware it doesn't know

801
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:30,849
the difference between malware and

802
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:33,730
benign is so what you have to do is you

803
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:35,559
have to create a baseline and the way to

804
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,529
create a baseline is you say what is

805
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:40,779
clean versus what is malicious um you

806
00:34:38,529 --> 00:34:42,250
don't always teach it on one thing right

807
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:44,230
the only catch on one thing and that

808
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,239
comes out false positives because if you

809
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,469
only teach you know malware and you

810
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,219
teach it too many times

811
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:54,399
then you over teach you over you

812
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:56,649
overcompensate the the algorithm and

813
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,960
they may there's two things I could

814
00:34:56,649 --> 00:35:00,730
happen one you won't catch anything you

815
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,589
taught it so much that you won't be able

816
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,660
to say the difference between wrong and

817
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:07,839
right is or you know white and black is

818
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:09,160
or the second thing is you'll you'll

819
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,259
catch things but it will be false

820
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,930
positives because you don't know what

821
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:18,100
um what's clear and what was actually

822
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:21,069
the gray area and so you fix it you fix

823
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,740
it by and then part of the the training

824
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:26,320
actually if I go back a little bit part

825
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:30,669
of the training is a balanced data set

826
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:34,510
right you want to balance want to

827
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:36,940
balance and not not create too many too

828
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:39,370
much noise into the samples and just

829
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:42,280
enough and that's it's a it's also part

830
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:45,730
of defensins IP or data sciences they

831
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,920
have this train they know how to not do

832
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:50,680
too much or too little and that's the

833
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,250
whole brain behind putting it into a

834
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:57,100
client and protection in more details

835
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,020
Jeff I can go offline I do have

836
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,750
different I have actually has different

837
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,070
slides on peer deep learning and we can

838
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,020
go into a little more detail if you like

839
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:11,500
to look at that in examples in the real

840
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:12,790
world without outside of this call but

841
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,980
hopefully that's able to answer your

842
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,940
overfitting right here that was

843
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,460
overcompensating what I mean by that is

844
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,590
overfitting avoid memorizing the

845
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,570
specific files available in the data set

846
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:24,880
right you don't want to teach it only

847
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:27,850
one thing and it starts to only look at

848
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,490
that when that one thing and that's

849
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:36,130
overfitting is a deep learning

850
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:38,649
terminology it's yeah that's and if I go

851
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:41,950
to back to one more example how do you

852
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,600
fix it it's right the for the example

853
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,790
with Cove in nineteen and they're using

854
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,490
deep learning you show a lot of pictures

855
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:50,710
of the Cova nineteen lungs and you show

856
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:53,200
a lot of pictures of the influenza lungs

857
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:55,630
but just enough for both so that you

858
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,350
don't only teach it that info on that

859
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:01,150
Kobe nineteen long and you know

860
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:03,220
everything else is negative and false

861
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:06,100
positive I just wonder in my head you

862
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,720
know how many influenza patients are

863
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,509
actually being diagnosed as Cova

864
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:15,509
nineteen I don't know but that could be

865
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:15,510
an issue right now all right

866
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,480
false positives that's really bad no

867
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,700
false positives okay here let me show

868
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:28,710
you an example I've created a lab for

869
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:31,439
you me go into my VM I create a sandbox

870
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:34,050
environment and this is a typical one

871
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,310
that I share with some prospects and

872
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:42,510
clients and run through POCs so virus

873
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:45,330
total virus total is it's a beta

874
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:48,630
database of uploaded malware and

875
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:51,240
uploaded malware samples and a

876
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:53,130
consumer-based virus will allow you to

877
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,140
upload any document that you find

878
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,020
suspicious into this database to see if

879
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,750
any other vendor has detected as

880
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:03,570
malicious and once it's uploaded it

881
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:06,450
creates signature and and other vendors

882
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:08,880
are able to use that what deep instinct

883
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:13,580
what I like to do is I look at my word

884
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,980
that is less than 12 hours old so

885
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:19,770
everyone can see my screen it's Q and

886
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,140
13th and 12 hours from now I'm looking

887
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:23,940
at portable executables and just to

888
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,609
create a nice little so I'm not looking

889
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:29,390
at false positives I look at 30 other

890
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:32,520
vendors that find it in less than 45

891
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:34,920
detected so let's take a look here I

892
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,930
have the deep instinct client installed

893
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,290
on my device it's not using any

894
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:42,210
signatures and this is the client that

895
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,630
sits on them on the mobile device or

896
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:49,890
laptop or even server and it's able to

897
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:52,770
as I'm downloading each one prevent each

898
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:55,680
one in real time right so it's able to

899
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:58,020
identify this is a poor that's too deep

900
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,000
static analysis this brain is able to

901
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:02,509
detect that it's a pool and I made sure

902
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,270
you know their example

903
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:07,190
download air before the file so every

904
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,560
file that's being written to disk it's

905
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:11,330
intercepted by this brain to say all

906
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,730
right I'm gonna prevent this right now

907
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:16,069
before you could actually and it goes so

908
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,230
quickly that only a tenth file is is

909
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:20,300
found not even the full files even being

910
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:22,910
able written to disk let me show you

911
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,580
another sometimes quarter barbecue bowls

912
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,200
are easy right you can name it a

913
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:31,460
potentially unknown application what

914
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:35,620
about a PDF that isn't that's actually a

915
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:39,020
malicious PDF so chapter one or a story

916
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:41,210
so when you're looking at other samples

917
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:47,340
right here PDFs do the trojans out of

918
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:49,830
PDFs or I'm going to close this this PDF

919
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,390
fail to air so this was only it was

920
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,040
probably less than a megabyte and it's

921
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,990
already prevented in real in pre

922
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,910
executions this is called pre execution

923
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,129
where it doesn't sit on the desk doesn't

924
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:03,089
require sandboxing it never actually

925
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:05,100
executed or intercepted and at the look

926
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:07,560
at here it's like at the chrome cache

927
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,390
level right before it can even be ridden

928
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,750
to this it's already been analyzed and

929
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:14,339
prevented what about another way a lot

930
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,800
of you know machine learning doesn't

931
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:20,220
some engines don't look at RTS which is

932
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,890
a font file or a file that has certain

933
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:25,589
macros inside so right here is saying I

934
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:28,049
couldn't find ones that were today

935
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:31,140
because not many malware come in RTF

936
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:32,010
format so I had to a couple days but

937
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,160
that's beside the point

938
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:37,410
let me just download an RTF file fail to

939
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,569
download so quick

940
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,790
right so and then I can go into the year

941
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,440
with virustotal

942
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:47,090
and I think I click on something by

943
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,340
accident I can look at this hash and

944
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:51,990
these are all the other signature based

945
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,880
protections and this is some of your

946
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,290
your consumer based signature

947
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,750
protections are able to count as

948
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:59,520
malicious and then there's some of the

949
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,980
machine learning companies out there

950
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,200
that undetected because it didn't isn't

951
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,590
one maybe not able to look at you know

952
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:09,660
process the file type on the file type

953
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:13,830
is RTF and it's not added in the machine

954
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:17,700
learning it wasn't trained on RTS or the

955
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:19,470
the is undetected because there's no

956
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,240
signature and there was no machine

957
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,549
learning algorithm that was that was

958
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:27,899
taught about you know how PDFs can be

959
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:30,480
manipulated for RTF in this example like

960
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,670
to point that out and keep in sync the

961
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,190
actual client is actually three months

962
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:36,900
old the signature is three months old so

963
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:39,540
three months ago was the latest update

964
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:43,560
on the client itself and deep instinct

965
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:46,320
endpoint protection and we're protecting

966
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,090
our pre execution and that's the way it

967
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,980
works online and offline how about this

968
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:52,890
since we have a little bit of time I'm

969
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:55,770
going to disconnect my internet so now

970
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:59,430
there's no internet connectivity and in

971
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:03,780
here I downloaded the top 25 malware on

972
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:04,470
samples you know extract here so the

973
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,650
passwords

974
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:09,598
and on the top 25 from virustotal and as

975
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,540
each file being written to disk is

976
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,940
actually being deleted quarantined

977
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,950
removes before it can infect the

978
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,040
computer it doesn't even have time to

979
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:22,290
sit on the disk and this brain is able

980
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:24,270
to understand I haven't ran this one

981
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,770
before yet so this is brand-new and this

982
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:28,730
is offline this is no internet

983
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:32,190
connectivity 25 out of 25 samples

984
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:34,740
prevented in zero time this is what deep

985
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:37,080
learning this is deep instinct and this

986
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,910
is a what we've created the algorithms

987
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,770
from AI machine learning now deep

988
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:44,069
learning to to apply to an endpoint

989
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:45,570
security product all right without that

990
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:46,859
yeah that's just some of the cool

991
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:48,510
examples here I hope you guys were

992
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:50,580
intrigued either those I think that's

993
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:53,340
fun I'm glad all 25 samples were caught

994
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,930
I feel safe and the user never in

995
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,090
phishing attacks right if you get an

996
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:59,549
email with the PDF that's malicious boom

997
00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:02,849
then the engine will well the brain will

998
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:06,450
then detect and prevent on the decipher

999
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:08,340
the cyber attack us so would they have a

1000
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:11,129
minute left what I would like to also

1001
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:13,940
show you in a recap let me see if I

1002
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:20,420
agree have a recap slide

1003
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:21,770
recap um here so we have the past the

1004
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,810
past is the Aviara

1005
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,280
signature based in heuristics the

1006
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,740
present is machine learning the era

1007
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,520
where we have detection on human

1008
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:33,770
selected features it's limited but now

1009
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,680
the future deep learning has a higher

1010
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:39,380
detection rate that she skips the human

1011
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,710
engineering capabilities and now be able

1012
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:44,510
to defeat it raw data in a file in

1013
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:47,290
actually train on the algorithms create

1014
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:49,730
a brain now presented on the computer

1015
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,470
and that's the future with deep deep

1016
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,510
instinct and deep learning now I

1017
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:56,089
promised you at the end and I know we

1018
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,920
might be going a little bit over join

1019
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:59,839

lot of information a lot of slides I

1039
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,010
think it was about 40 slides but we went

1040
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:44,420
through it quickly I hope you uh you

1041

00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,069
right it took me exactly to your

1050
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:05,450
LinkedIn page to connect so also you had

1051
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:08,329
mentioned about sharing your

1052

presentation with the group so I did

1053
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:11,720
touch base with Michael as we you were

1054
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:13,700

1055
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,348
said that you got an email kind of from

1056
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,790
