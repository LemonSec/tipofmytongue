1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:11,670
hey everybody good afternoon um thank

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,500
you Mike for sure the kind of production

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,090
and then putting on this awesome event

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,060
with all that help and support of the

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,910
community let's go ahead and get started

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,509
because it's it's time to have some fun

7
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:27,750
so title this talk is making sense of

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,850
Splunk Enterprise again my name is

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,590
Jonathan singer and I'm a spun practice

10
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,010
lead in the Southeast region

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,800
I've got point security so a little bit

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,739
about our agenda for today we'll talk

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,839
about Who am I right why do I deserve to

14
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,968
talk about this stuff and what's my

15
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:47,159
background we'll talk about the history

16
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,949
of logging I'm a big fan of building a

17
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,239
foundation and understanding right where

18
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,159
the current technologies that we're

19
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,149
using today what's the history behind

20
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,629
where'd that come from

21
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,670
why is it the way we're doing things

22
00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,710
well talk about what is spark right I

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,110
mean it can be a lot of things well find

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,300
out who uses smoke I think it's also

25
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,210
really important because oftentimes you

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,670
may look at other case studies or you

27
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,990
know companies that are using a product

28
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,450
we want to know what it's doing for them

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,689
and how they're applying this set of

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,880
technology and then my fun facts on how

31
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,439
to get the most out of Spock I've been

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,060
doing this for a while I've learned

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,969
quite a bit about you know some of the

34
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,000
what to do what not to do how to make

35
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:31,798
the most of the tool and then I want to

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,130
remind everybody that you know getting

37
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,159
into this stuff yeah it's free you know

38
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,929
I don't work for Splunk I work for God

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,420
point but this is what I enjoy this what

40
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,740
I talk about and then finally I'll

41
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,960
actually talk about what I do at guide

42
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,719
point security you know just to kind of

43
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,240
round it off if that sounds good

44
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:53,070
so Who am I I already talked about my

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,780
spunk practically down here in southeast

46
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,658
where cyber security company say hi

47
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,909
we're hanging out I'm in I'm in the chat

48
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,990
thanks for the comment on the cool

49
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,390
background it's just hacker stuff prior

50
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,130
to working with guide point and in doing

51
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,020
all this stuff and even this one stuff I

52
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,930
worked in data centers Red Hat web

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,730
application security ir but I spend a

54
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,270
lot of my time reading logs with grep

55
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,730
and that taught me a lot

56
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,010
about how I appreciate spork and similar

57
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,560
sim tools today I've got a bunch of

58
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,290
letters G CIA Japan blah blah

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,150
we love letters right I do have a

60
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,730
master's in cybersecurity I'm a big

61
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,660
advocate for punishment in higher

62
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,519
education and then finally some fun

63
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,560
facts right I leave the local lost

64
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,960
chapter here I co-founded b-sides

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,490
Orlando eight years ago

66
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,740
and I love talking at conferences so you

67
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,470
know just add this one to the list and

68
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,290
then I'm a bad shaker that's one of my

69
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,880
hobbies I admit badges at Def Con I make

70
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,290
that just for b-sides conferences all

71
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,180
kinds of fun stuff like that in fact I'm

72
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,560
a goon at Def Con so if anybody ever

73
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,510
sees me roaming the halls with a red

74
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,110
shirt yelling at you it's out of love I

75
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,750
promise so let's talk a little bit about

76
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:14,100
the history of logging right love

77
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,840
history um fun fact this syslog protocol

78
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,440
it was originally designed in the 80s

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,700
and it was put together by the seminal

80
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,290
team and if anybody's familiar

81
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,350
old-school Linux endmill

82
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,450
is just this classic application for for

83
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,880
email transmission and stuff like that

84
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,350
and so single team wanted to log their

85
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,049
application and so they put together the

86
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,140
initial standards for for the syslog

87
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,730
protocol and you know a lot of

88
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,500
developers and stuff back in the day is

89
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,560
very tight-knit you know community

90
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,209
developing all these applications for

91
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,680
the linux environment and unix and

92
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,260
things like that and so other

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,070
applications at the time started to

94
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,380
adopt this publish standard that said

95
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,579
mil was kind of putting out there and

96
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,690
they said hey look this is how we're

97
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,890
kind of doing things and other people

98
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,109
said that's very clever

99
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,429
oh you know we're gonna do it the same

100
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,760
way you're doing it right lose a little

101
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,530
source code sounds great and from that

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,200
point it started to kind of grow and it

103
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,380
just kind of just became the standard

104
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,970
for any kind of Unix Linux logging right

105
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,040
if your application was generating long

106
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:22,340
data it was from this syslog protocol

107
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,070
you know put out by the send mail team

108
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:30,210
in fact it was just assumed for a long

109
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,349
time that this was a big publicise

110
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:35,340
well-documented stand

111
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:38,420
but surprisingly for several decades the

112
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,770
syslog protocol was being used being

113
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,920
added to different applications and it

114
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,799
wasn't even until 2001 that it finally

115
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,950
made it into the RFC and that's when I

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,770
was just even initially documented it

117
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,990
was actually standardized in 2009 and

118
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,820
when you kind of look back and put

119
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,880
things in perspective you know that's

120
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,680
almost three decades of using a protocol

121
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,020
before it was actually like hey you know

122
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,000
I think we have something here there

123
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,919
seems to be a lot of traction with it

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,210
so it's actually quite impressive of how

125
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:15,030
long these things Lisp existed prior to

126
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,669
it becoming you know published and

127
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:21,809
document it is something that now people

128
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:24,420
will want to apply a standard user oh

129
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,520
yes you want to read our piece totally

130
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,290
cool with me I just you know there's a

131
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,010
couple good ones out there it's a lot of

132
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,750
documentation if you ask me um so one of

133
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,719
the cool things though that I did find

134
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:41,220
while pilfering my history story on RFPs

135
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:44,250
is that is that the they they decided

136
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,870
you know what syslog can can relay in a

137
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,760
lot of different ways and what's

138
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,260
interesting here is that these different

139
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,510
architectural models to allow data

140
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,450
transmitted from the generation of the

141
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,039
log data or application to where it was

142
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,110
ultimately being collected for review

143
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,350
they wanted to be able to be flexible

144
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:04,920
with that right um in fact if you look

145
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:07,830
at this wonderful archaic after display

146
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,570
here um it kind of looks familiar

147
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,460
especially if you're already familiar

148
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:15,390
with with any kind of similar logging

149
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,950
tool the concept of of generating in at

150
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,770
one place and then relaying it through

151
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,360
another system or application whether it

152
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,719
has multiple times or even splitting the

153
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,580
data this is this has been well

154
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,790
understood and well contrived for quite

155
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:32,820
a while here and so in you know in my

156
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:36,150
opinion this is the basis of how almost

157
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:39,210
all modern logging and send technologies

158
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:42,210
are built today and this is from two

159
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,099
decades ago published even prior older

160
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,190
than that

161
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,370
and so this technology you know doesn't

162
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,960
even really look like it's changed much

163
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,390
from when it was originally designed and

164
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,669
architected but it's kind of fun to see

165
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:59,419
where a lot of these tools today came

166
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:02,990
from and that put together that concept

167
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,820
of centralized logging right I think why

168
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,560
do we do this in the first place well we

169
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,150
collect these logs from all these

170
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,580
different systems and applications it's

171
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,320
put in one place okay okay so you you

172
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,810
put all my logs in one place now what

173
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,780
right well you can store them for long

174
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:22,070
term right oftentimes space was very

175
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:24,859
scarce on systems back in the day and

176
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:27,020
it's not like yeah then the log itself

177
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,590
has really changed much it's a string

178
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,840
right but you know a one gigabyte hard

179
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,940
drive back in the day was kind of a big

180
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,880
deal versus what you know today laughing

181
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,110
at a one terabyte and so offloading you

182
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,490
know putting in a central place allowed

183
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,770
you to actually save a lot of space on

184
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:45,260
that host or system generating the data

185
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,109
and then from there it just kind of adds

186
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,550
benefits really you know um you know if

187
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,650
something happened you had to you have

188
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,240
to login into every single box soon

189
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,710
imagine if you're in a data center we

190
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,420
just call in crash cards we had to run

191
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,859
the monitor up and plug into every

192
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,660
single system just to look at the data

193
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,030
so you can review it all from one

194
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,900
centralized place doesn't matter where

195
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,400
it comes from an you can search for

196
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,960
values across multiple systems very

197
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,190
quickly for instance you can look for an

198
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,710
IP address and find out how many

199
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,490
different systems that IP was found in

200
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,440
the log so very cool stuff in my opinion

201
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,510
from back in the day um so let's talk

202
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,120
about you know the whole shining star I

203
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,550
guess well today right what is slow so

204
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,610
we you have spunk here at the top and

205
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:28,340
it's an architecture of different moving

206
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,590
components right you have your searching

207
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,299
capabilities which is going to be like

208
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,250
that magnifying glass layer right so the

209
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,530
people use the search console to look at

210
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,840
the data and to architect these searches

211
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,909
in this SPL language and then we have

212
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,250
what's called the indexing tier and

213
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,500
that's where these little green database

214
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,240
looking symbols are and and that's where

215
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,480
your data is stored so it comes into

216
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,300
Splunk image it's parsed and that data

217
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,130
is then indexed and brought in and it's

218
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,420
it it's not like a like a database

219
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,189
it's a little bit different there's

220
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,120
there's some fun algorithms around it

221
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,620
and there's different types of searching

222
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,930
blooms and things like that but the idea

223
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,790
is that the data stored so that's

224
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,769
quickly searchable based off of all

225
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,569
kinds of different keywords and then

226
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:14,850
finally that that third one and the gray

227
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:16,860
area with the little tux penguins there

228
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,630
that's what we call the 42 right

229
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,360
ultimately where that data is sourcing

230
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,740
from so in that order right we source

231
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,329
the data we send it to our conductors

232
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,209
and then those indexes are searched by

233
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:28,888
our searching consoles right and then

234
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,910
you know that that data that we're

235
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:31,620
forwarding that we're bringing in

236
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,449
remotely all over the place you know

237
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,920
we're talking all your different systems

238
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:36,089
and your applications and your database

239
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,910
is in your virtualization in your

240
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:41,610
firewalls right I mean really it comes

241
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,790
from the vast variety across your

242
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,769
organization um you know just to name a

243
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,899
few places there's a lot of big names

244
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:50,610
out there and they've all you know

245
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,360
looked at you spoke you know in other

246
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:56,069
sims to UM to get familiar with their

247
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,800
logs and their long types and be able to

248
00:09:56,069 --> 00:10:00,839
send that data so can you know you have

249
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,719
to look at these same tools as something

250
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,699
that has to kind of have arms into every

251
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,540
aspect of your enterprise if you're not

252
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:11,420
collecting data from everywhere um you

253
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,980
can't paint the full picture right um

254
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,860
these these people today are just much

255
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,079
more clever as far as a business could

256
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,670
have different ways of being compromised

257
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,290
whether it's your you know your website

258
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,810
or directly into your network at a

259
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,689
firewall or some kind of API with a

260
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,369
partner or insider threat right or your

261
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:30,810
endpoints and somebody's checking email

262
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,029
clicking clicking the wrong waves

263
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,008
there's many different ways and attack

264
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:37,230
vectors in an organization and so just

265
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:40,050
being able to collect all that data and

266
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:42,829
make sense of it is what the big goal

267
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:47,310
that bigger picture is trying to achieve

268
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:49,349
aren't both of that talk tech right what

269
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:52,199
what is a log anyways right like why is

270
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,079
this important why do we care and how

271
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:58,500
does look actually make use or make

272
00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:00,930
sense of this data um and so we fought

273
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,550
machined it and the vernacular of Splunk

274
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,469
but let's just throw this example out

275
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,829
here right and so we have a log and

276
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,720
there's quite a few fields and back in

277
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:12,628
the damaged and how you see these grip

278
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,579
is a very simple to use regular

279
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:16,410
expression based searching tool either

280
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:18,479
something is there it doesn't image

281
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,009
shows you where it is yeah there's a lot

282
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,550
of other things to it but you get the

283
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:22,139
idea

284
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,870
but what spook does is when it looks at

285
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,430
this log there's a lot and so these

286
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,230
green highlighted fields are actually

287
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,849
smart parsing out the data and what

288
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,980
we've done is we parse a date and a time

289
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,680
we've also been able to parse out you

290
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,810
know bytes and command and Department

291
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,689
right and customer name and result in

292
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:43,229
PID in process and so there's a lot of

293
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:47,819
rich fields right and key value pairs in

294
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:49,560
these logs that we can parse out with

295
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:51,959
Splunk and suddenly all of these

296
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,388
variables become individually searchable

297
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,399
so then instead of saying you know I

298
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:59,930
just want to generalize or customer logs

299
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:04,560
it's I want to find logs where the sshd

300
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:06,269
process right was identified or was a

301
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,250
key value pair so suddenly we're

302
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:09,120
becoming more granular and more specific

303
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,699
on our searches

304
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,129
and pivoting off of specific variables

305
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:17,399
or key values rather than a larger

306
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:19,709
string and just like that we went from

307
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,199
making our haystack a little bit smaller

308
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:25,349
but it's always going to be a haystack

309
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:28,349
somehow or some way but if you can

310
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,839
shrink the size of that haystack you

311
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,329
will find that needle quicker and more

312
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,309
effectively right the worst would be a

313
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:38,878
needle in a needle stack but that's a

314
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:42,350
story for another day so along with

315
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:45,059
those fields that are broken out from a

316
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,019
Splunk you know Roman law I'm gonna

317
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:48,689
enter slug

318
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:50,699
smoke also it takes a moment and tack

319
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:53,879
some metal it I called metadata on top

320
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:55,109
of it right and so every log has to have

321
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,259
these three fields

322
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:00,629
the first one is host where did this log

323
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:05,430
come from that's either the host name

324
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:07,500
result by DMS or an IP address so even

325
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,019
if an application on a system generates

326
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,019
logged that host still had to be a

327
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:15,149
computer sending that long to Splunk it

328
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,309
somewhere down the tree chain so where

329
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,519
did the system what system did this come

330
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:21,000
from

331
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,710
now source source helps to find where

332
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,160
the log originated on that

333
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:28,860
system so a source could be a particular

334
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,060
path to a file so if we're reading like

335
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,250
a log file

336
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,109
that's where sources so now we know what

337
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,990
system it came from and what file on

338
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,250
that system this came from and it

339
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,230
finally have something called source

340
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,060
type which is what's the data structure

341
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,730
of it so I know what system it came from

342
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,849
I know what file on the system it came

343
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,150
from but do I know what type of data is

344
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,110
is now that's very helpful because

345
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,750
classification and the identification of

346
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,980
data is gonna help you quickly parse out

347
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,890
what all those fields are there's

348
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,450
characteristics to each type of log and

349
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,850
in that furthermore it's gonna allow you

350
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,410
to maybe isolate oh yeah I only want to

351
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,880
see the log from my talent well two

352
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,390
firewalls I only want to see the logs

353
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,910
you know from my checkmarks application

354
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,890
security review so you get the

355
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,839
opportunity to focus on a specific type

356
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,370
of data because you may have multiple

357
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,480
types and multiple searches from a

358
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,550
single host so you know what do I mean

359
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,160
by logs look different no like really

360
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,319
lawns look different right we have an

361
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,410
example of three different vendors here

362
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:35,850
a FortiGate right that's a firewall for

363
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:37,050
some people um and this FortiGate calls

364
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,700
it source right here

365
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:43,949
sr CIT but palo Pal doesn't even give it

366
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,410
a variable you know something equals

367
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:48,510
term it just throws it in the log so I

368
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,270
need to know that that position in the

369
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,670
log that comma-delimited position that

370
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:55,949
that field is a source that's where that

371
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,490
source type definition comes in is is

372
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,870
being able to say okay this log it looks

373
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,220
like this and this is where the data

374
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,930
exists and this log that looks like this

375
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,730
and this is what this data is and then

376
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,079
finally something like Apache you know

377
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,440
just those IP right up front

378
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:13,560
um and so each one its defining a little

379
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,540
bit differently so Splunk is going to

380
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,729
kind of build a commonality across

381
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,550
different source types using this common

382
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,100
a common information model and and

383
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:25,170
building these like aliases or

384
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,700
comparisons so a source ID and one log

385
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:27,839
is going to look different than in a

386
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,880
different loan but that doesn't mean

387
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,190
that that we can't determine that

388
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,040
they're both the same purpose and that

389
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,210
way we can actually search for one

390
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,120
single value

391
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:40,740
for a source IP specifically no not a

392
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,020
destination in Turkey or anything else

393
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,200
across different types of log so

394
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,270
suddenly we are now operating more

395
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,220
efficiently right in our searches we're

396
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:53,520
shrinking that haystack and we're

397
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,940
actually getting results quicker super

398
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,529
cool stuff right um so so that's how so

399
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,600
what how do we search in the first place

400
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:03,500
right what is this that we're dealing

401
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,480
with here so searching is based off of

402
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:10,649
this language this search process image

403
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,260
called SPL over 140 commands there's all

404
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:17,010
kinds of crazy stuff when it comes to it

405
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:22,980
but um but what's what's cool is that it

406
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:25,980
is based off of UNIX and sequel and if

407
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:28,830
you're already familiar with stuff like

408
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,560
bash and you're already doing day-to-day

409
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:33,450
stuff with SQL any of the variants the

410
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,739
concept is is it's a combination of the

411
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:40,500
two so pipelining your commands and

412
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,400
doing boolean based logic is going to

413
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:47,220
really accelerate learning that that's

414
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:51,000
SPL you know that language so that you

415
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:54,660
can be an efficient searcher and so some

416
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,970
of those commands allow you to do stuff

417
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,500
like filter modify manipulate enrich

418
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,200
insert delete and if you're an

419
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,820
old-school Linux fan like me know we

420
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,970
used to call those cut set and awk

421
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,610
uh-huh but you don't have to do all

422
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,530
those things you can actually you know

423
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:13,020
do it all in line and so part of that

424
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,730
searching process is manipulating and

425
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,679
actively working with the data you can

426
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,819
even create variables you can do

427
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,500
algorithmic you know manipulation and

428
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,209
you can even do testing so if statements

429
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,420
and cases and things like that some very

430
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,670
very deep and honestly I don't use all

431
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,540
the commands but there's a lot out there

432
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:36,420
and if somebody were to ask what's your

433
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,399
favorite command transaction it's pretty

434
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:42,059
cool check it out maybe the end I'll

435
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,910
tell you oh so now that we understand

436
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:46,470
that slug is bringing in our logs its

437
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,880
parsing that data and identifying those

438
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,770
fields and allowing this to make those

439
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,110
fields pivotable and searchable

440
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:55,139
um we've already gotten the approach on

441
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:59,399
okay I am ready to start performing my

442
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:02,070
searches but how do I really make value

443
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:03,510
here like it's you know we invested in

444
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,158
this expensive tool or I'm at home

445
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,140
experimenting with it which because it's

446
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:08,580
free you can get up to 500 Meg's of log

447
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,309
data a day and you can just run this at

448
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,629
your house just for fun there's to see

449
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:14,100
what's going on in your network

450
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,210
you'd be surprised your router makes a

451
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:20,219
lot of logs and and so the big right the

452
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,950
big seller you're in the business space

453
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,049
and the enterprise space is the

454
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,390
dashboard right it's a visualization of

455
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:29,610
that data how do I present my data in

456
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,649
such a manner that anybody can make

457
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,260
sense of it in fact I throw up this

458
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:37,439
executive dashboard here why because

459
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:40,440
executives love dashboards percentages

460
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,390
numbers definitive right is it a yes or

461
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,770
a no is it working or is it not am i

462
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:49,409
making money and you know this is a

463
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,760
great example of just taking data from

464
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:52,590
different departments right we have IT

465
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,270
operations we have security with

466
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,459
application delivery of business

467
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:58,260
analytics and IOT and all of these

468
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,029
different systems are actively logging

469
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,799
you bring that data centralized back in

470
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:03,960
a slum and then you make sense of it

471
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,330
right so we can do trends and graphs and

472
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,149
analytics um we can determine the state

473
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:13,529
of different things all based off of the

474
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:15,090
log data that's generated oh you know if

475
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:18,390
we wanted to go down the security room

476
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,189
we absolutely can are stuff like

477
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,830
firewalls and our VPNs are constantly

478
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,350
generating data based off of those

479
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:29,250
connection attempts where they're coming

480
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:31,289
from in the world are people failing are

481
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,820
people successful or we're seeing 10

482
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,529
fails in a row and then a successful

483
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,950
within you know a certain small time

484
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:40,020
frame is that a brute-force the idea is

485
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,850
if you can collect the data and you

486
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,830
understand what it means you can start

487
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,590
to make sense of it you can make it

488
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,840
alert about actionable displayable on

489
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,760
and then you can build your what we call

490
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,168
correlations right so on the bottom left

491
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,840
we have what's called notable events

492
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:58,039
that's a series of conditions that are

493
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,310
predefined in a search query so that

494
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:02,980
when that event top

495
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:04,659
or that event comes up well creates an

496
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,790
alert it's a notification about it

497
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,550
right and so SQL injection attack

498
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,800
detected well in theory what does that

499
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,450
look like well we would maybe look at

500
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,030
our application logs that are web-based

501
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,280
or public facing and then we would look

502
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,560
for particular characters that are often

503
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,300
used in sequel injection so stuff like

504
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,889
single quotes right what would that ever

505
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,919
need to be in a query

506
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,390
um that's user generated right we're

507
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,920
talking about the parameters here and

508
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:35,800
you know stuff like join and you know

509
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,030
things like that and and those are often

510
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,000
used in sequel junctions so you can say

511
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:42,160
hey slump if these logs from this type

512
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,080
of system have these kind of fields in

513
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,520
them let me know right just let me know

514
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:51,699
when when we're under attack and so

515
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,650
working with the data is is much easier

516
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,370
once it's in and once it actually makes

517
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,650
sense right

518
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,149
oh and by the way I am watching the

519
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,560
discord so if there's any questions

520
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,080
along the way please feel free to shout

521
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,060
out I did crcs mentioned the cool

522
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,129
background so you can also just say hey

523
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:11,620
oh finally here you know a lot of people

524
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:14,170
guess plunk it they do security right

525
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,370
but everybody's gonna hate me when I say

526
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,740
this monkey it's not a send out of the

527
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:20,679
box you can make it a sin but the best

528
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,930
part in my opinion is the versatility to

529
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,060
make it whatever you want like it is for

530
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,520
your organization is a tool that can be

531
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,040
used by different teams let's take this

532
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,070
example for instance so IT operations

533
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:36,700
has a a web application here so we have

534
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:38,919
stuff like apache and mysql that log

535
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,140
source can still be used by other people

536
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,690
so let's just take Apache log that's an

537
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,930
example this for a web application this

538
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:49,570
web application can be used by security

539
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,950
to look for the sequel injections and

540
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,080
other types of web based wonder

541
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,850
abilities it can be used by IT to

542
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,000
monitor application health response

543
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:00,399
uptime 404 errors versus you know 200

544
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,790
successful or their pages missing it as

545
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,730
their experiential and UI issues from

546
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,680
the user space and then finally it can

547
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,630
be used by marketing team to determine

548
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,610
which pages are most popular when people

549
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,690
land where do they click next you know

550
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,100
there's a lot of different

551
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,320
departments and teams within an

552
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,090
organization that can use the one single

553
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,340
long source for multiple different

554
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,320
purposes and just to put it out there

555
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,689
the pricing model first look I hate to

556
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,149
talk about money in business and stuff

557
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:31,029
like that but once data is in spot there

558
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:32,949
isn't a charge to use it so if you can

559
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:34,929
figure out how to maximize the data that

560
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,149
you already have in spunk and get the

561
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:39,850
most people using that same data set

562
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:41,949
like that's free value that's added

563
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,629
value right there where the data is

564
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,210
already in that's where the billing

565
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:47,769
takes place the how are you using this

566
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,629
data how many people can you get

567
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:51,549
enriching it and making sense of it for

568
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:53,199
their departments that's entirely to you

569
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:59,139
and that's an things that I love to

570
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:01,090
support spunk tech who uses Splunk all

571
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:02,678
right at the end of the day we talked

572
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,299
about then it comes from your security

573
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,009
and your network in your databases right

574
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:08,710
it's all these different things you know

575
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:11,710
really look if something generates data

576
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:15,580
or generates logs splut can make sense

577
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,990
of it it can use it so now that we know

578
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,780
that and we know that can be used by

579
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,009
different members of our organization

580
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,428
[Music]

581
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:26,110
let's take a look at some examples here

582
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:29,169
sorry I wish I had my water somewhere

583
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,668
oh so Donna's pizza

584
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:33,850
what girls gonna call them out like that

585
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:37,139
right more than a half of Domino's

586
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:40,059
orders today aren't digital we do not

587
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:41,769
call nobody picks up the phone anymore I

588
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:46,149
don't understand these Millennials and

589
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:48,970
oh you know we have a different world we

590
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:52,299
live in we are digital we are operating

591
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,840
online and we expect it to work the

592
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:55,629
first time

593
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:59,769
right and we're just kind of little you

594
00:23:55,629 --> 00:24:01,719
know we're privileged like that so so

595
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:03,970
whose it's used by their IT mr. security

596
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,039
but but what they're doing it is they're

597
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,899
monitoring that experience health right

598
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:11,559
is the app responsive is the website

599
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:13,989
responsive because if if a website

600
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,580
doesn't work you are bound to go

601
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,960
somewhere else right if you log into a

602
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,418
website and there suddenly becomes an

603
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,549
error you don't often continue to just

604
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:23,139
try like well maybe you don't start

605
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:27,280
working like no if your experience is

606
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:30,459
terrible you lose business right and

607
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:33,820
it is very important for their stream

608
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:37,300
and and flow of successful transactions

609
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,970
to constantly work and be very fast in

610
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:42,370
fact Domino's their most important day

611
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:46,690
is the Super Bowl and if they have an

612
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:48,040
outage on the Super Bowl that I I call

613
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:52,270
is bad business

614
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:54,550
so Splunk is one of the you know many

615
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:57,010
ways Domino's does take this stuff very

616
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:59,470
seriously and utilize it to make a

617
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,500
better business I hope everybody

618
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:05,530
participated in the US Census because it

619
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:07,390
makes a country better uh but this year

620
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,310
all right is the first digital

621
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,780
descending alright so every twenty years

622
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:12,700
first time they're actually letting you

623
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,500
to go online and do this stuff and the

624
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,210
US Census Bureau is making sense of that

625
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,730
data they're breaking down the analysis

626
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,050
with all of that rich information and so

627
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,270
now they can start pivoting office block

628
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,950
by state by counting by all the

629
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:27,280
different statistics and factors that

630
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,080
are part of the census um and it's

631
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:34,810
fantastic what you can do with this much

632
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:37,840
data as far as what it you know really

633
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:39,490
means and how to how to analyze it

634
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,929
quickly we're not crunching paper and

635
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,600
numbers anymore the computers doing the

636
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:47,380
work for us so super super interesting

637
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,070
how that is happening now here's another

638
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:54,370
really cool one Carnival Cruise Lines um

639
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:56,770
they are using Splunk to look at every

640
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:59,649
single system on the physical cruise

641
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:01,660
ship and what that means but I am I'm

642
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:03,820
talking about the HVAC system so that

643
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,890
air conditioning then navigation system

644
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:09,460
the water purification so that when you

645
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:12,430
open that sinker that shower it's not

646
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,710
saltwater right and they're monitoring

647
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:19,150
the whole cruise ship so from an IOT

648
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:21,700
perspective and this data is critical to

649
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:25,020
safety and security of these ships than

650
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:27,340
all of those passengers on board and

651
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,440
another cool thing is they they have all

652
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,080
these new apps now and so you can use

653
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,740
Splunk to monitor the wireless

654
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,199
experience because the program is now in

655
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,080
your app and in your phone you can see

656
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,000
like all the activities for the day

657
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,500
and based off of your location in the

658
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,309
ship they can suggest things that are

659
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,750
nearby and so there now yes from a

660
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:50,399
business perspective tracking you

661
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,230
wherever you go on the ship but that

662
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:54,120
that really does help you from an

663
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,950
experience where they can make things

664
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,219
flow better so that you're not walking

665
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,750
long distances all the time to get to

666
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,100
different areas that maybe you want to

667
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,679
go to next so they have a good

668
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,289
understanding of that that you know how

669
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:10,049
people interact and float around the

670
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:13,649
ship to build better future experiences

671
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:16,320
for you and so all of this data again

672
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:18,809
can be analyzed parse put together and

673
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,529
and tabulated so that you can determine

674
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:26,039
the best route to handle things

675
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:28,830
whoo okay other than next let's talk a

676
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:30,510
little bit about values well great and

677
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,330
I'm not talking about how to throw money

678
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:37,769
at smoke I'm talking about how to make

679
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:41,250
pay for itself the first one is Splunk

680
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:44,940
base this is the de-facto App Store for

681
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:48,720
Splunk and you can go onto the website

682
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:51,630
and this is where you download the apps

683
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,639
and modules for spark this there's only

684
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,620
really let's be honest at the other day

685
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:59,059
there's a handful I think about five or

686
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:02,039
six paid ones but the rest are free and

687
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:04,889
this is where you see the partnerships

688
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:08,220
between major vendors insula so if you

689
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:09,689
run um you know a particular piece of

690
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,639
hardware in your environment type it in

691
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,940
the search and bring and download that

692
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:17,939
app that's going to plug into Splunk um

693
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:21,029
for that particular log type that way

694
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,559
when when you bring in the laws smoke is

695
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:23,880
already familiar with it this is the

696
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,370
trick to making

697
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,899
Splunk understand your logs and parse

698
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,449
out those individual fields that we

699
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:33,330
talked about now you can go to swamp

700
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,700
acecomm or you can use this book basic

701
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:40,439
built into Splunk this is actually in a

702
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:42,149
swamp what interface and you simply

703
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,380
browser more apps and it's the same

704
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:45,779
searching functionality and you can

705
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,080
click install with a one-click deal

706
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:53,039
you're now importing these different

707
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,530
parsers and apps okay right into your

708
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,290
spunk

709
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:58,180
environment now what's cool about smoke

710
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:00,970
base and all these apps that's up there

711
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:02,350
nearly 2000 apps and I just checked a

712
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,030
little bit earlier before this toxin yes

713
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:06,730
there's like nineteen hundred and

714
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:09,340
seventy something like that apps and

715
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:13,060
add-ons available on sport base today

716
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:16,000
right and these different apps are going

717
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,040
to help you make Splunk successful smoke

718
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,380
is itself as a data parser and you have

719
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,409
to tell it I'm getting logs from XYZ

720
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:27,790
vendor here's the app that makes it

721
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:31,120
parse those logs and so um these apps

722
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:34,360
are valuable in my opinion to making

723
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,500
Splunk do what what you what you're sold

724
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,750
on what you read about what it's

725
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,240
supposed to do in here you know in your

726
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:42,640
perspective in your view right now

727
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,650
there's some apps that entirely just

728
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,970
demonstrate and visualize data that you

729
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,640
know there's apps from certain vendors

730
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:51,010
that this is what is capable as far as a

731
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,320
visualization and a processing of logs

732
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:56,050
from our source and then other ones are

733
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,760
truly just background parsers but the

734
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:00,970
key here is that there is a cooperation

735
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,450
between the vendors and spawn to process

736
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:07,720
that data okay um when you get the app

737
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:09,700
from XYZ vendor it is prepared you're

738
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,250
now prepared to receive logs from that

739
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,930
system and it won't make sense right it

740
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,660
will break out those fields that you can

741
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:19,330
search off of one of the next other cool

742
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:22,810
tools that I love is answers this is a

743
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:25,840
QA forum where it uses an upvote system

744
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:28,139
to you know providing which is actually

745
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,490
kind of gamified users can log in and

746
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,620
participate in supply answers and if

747
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:35,110
they're you know voted the right answer

748
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,760
for users questions they get points and

749
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,590
it actually some cool stuff that happens

750
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,090
at the larger national conference if

751
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,790
you're a big participate in this kind of

752
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,290
stuff and so oftentimes you start out

753
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,820
here by searching you know is somebody

754
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:49,090
having the same issue that are how do I

755
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:51,520
do this and you might find an answer I

756
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,840
often times 9 9 out of 10 times don't

757
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,580
find exactly what I'm looking for right

758
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,649
here and answers but you know it if you

759
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,679
do not that's ok too

760
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:03,670
you can ask and the community will

761
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:05,560
respond so cool stuff there and then

762
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:07,330
finally I kind of made a little joke

763
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:11,379
about RFC's and

764
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:14,260
GOx earlier but um will soon raise a

765
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:17,640
hand if you've ever read the Microsoft

766
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,530
Windows documentation thoroughly I

767
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:23,230
didn't think so

768
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:24,760
look docks are actually pretty good they

769
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,510
are very well written

770
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:30,610
um they give you a lot of examples

771
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:34,450
visually step by step all kinds of

772
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:37,689
different things like that and you would

773
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:40,690
be surprised if you just simply pop over

774
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:42,610
to the docks and you know kind of search

775
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,290
for what you're looking for and there

776
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,649
will be provided a command line version

777
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:49,270
of it a web GUI version of it and and

778
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,740
what it does in the different caveats

779
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,230
and haven't even examples of different

780
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:55,000
parsing codes

781
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,550
really I'm absolutely impressed with the

782
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,330
documentation of Splunk and I don't say

783
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:06,399
I like reading the talks of most things

784
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:08,260
but these these are good Oh something

785
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,300
else that's really cool uh there is this

786
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,550
Lexie partnership look lexicon there's

787
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,260
so many words that are unique to Splunk

788
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:17,830
architecture or binocular things like

789
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:20,740
that that understanding what all of

790
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:22,419
these different key components are and

791
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,860
defining them is going to help you when

792
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,170
you're talking to support when you're

793
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,240
talking to professional services or even

794
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:31,180
when you're talking to other smokers you

795
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,400
know using the language of Splunk that

796
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:37,480
way you can get your message across

797
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,920
appropriately um and and so so what are

798
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,470
some of those things defined us right

799
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,180
well we have stuff like a search head

800
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,680
right that is the definition of the web

801
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,660
search console there's something the

802
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,730
indexers and oftentimes this is

803
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,740
comparable to other sins right smoke

804
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,620
does it one way but another sin they do

805
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,850
it you know similarly and they just call

806
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,679
it a little something different you know

807
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:58,240
Universal forwarders right that's the

808
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,790
agent that can also be called a

809
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,840
collector in other environments a heavy

810
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:07,180
folder is a Splunk system dedicated to

811
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,310
receiving from other forwarders so it's

812
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,810
like an intermediary point and then

813
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:13,690
finally of stuff like a deployment sir

814
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:16,480
it's a really fancy term for agent

815
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:20,010
management console you know but again

816
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,140
learning these particular words and

817
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,360
understand

818
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,429
where they play a role within this funk

819
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,040
environment is going to help you talk to

820
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:29,420
other professionals and get your point

821
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,360
across and so that you're all in the

822
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:34,010
same page and as especially if you're

823
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,428
going to do any kind of like education

824
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:39,320
and training which is free um you want

825
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:43,070
to know what these different key

826
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:46,220
components mean so a day you can go on

827
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:51,260
swung calm and take fundamentals one um

828
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:54,049
this is a free self-paced training that

829
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,700
you can just kind of get you know the

830
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:57,168
lay of the land so it's stuff like

831
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,820
navigating this one crate and use

832
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:01,850
different fields that we talked about a

833
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,500
big breakout right um you know you can

834
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,389
get statistics from you so these are

835
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:07,309
great examples of okay now I have my

836
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,359
data how do I start using it so walk you

837
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:10,369
through some of the capabilities and

838
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:11,359
examples so that creating reports

839
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:13,520
dashboards and alerts

840
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:18,199
that's the executive wing right there um

841
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,340
and did I mention a spring so this is a

842
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,689
great starting point

843
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,399
um and it's actually the training

844
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,260
required to get your first slump

845
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:29,418
certification which is called slump user

846
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:31,550
certified it's okay so when I'm often

847
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:33,949
working with a customer and they're

848
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,500
telling me oh you know we have about ten

849
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:37,250
analysts that will be using this spark

850
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,679
suite

851
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,929
I say alternative need to go and take

852
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,429
fundamentals on right now I don't think

853
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:44,840
they're allowed to login until they've

854
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:46,010
completed fundamentals one because

855
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,990
they're gonna have a million questions

856
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,820
how do I do this how do I do that

857
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:51,739
fun of those one is gonna cover all of

858
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,659
those things and so this is your

859
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:57,618
opportunity to get free training to your

860
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:59,990
employees and save time and time is

861
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:02,630
money from asking a million questions

862
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:07,520
that may already be answered in this

863
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:08,840
training material not funnels to its the

864
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,340
next step it's gonna get a little bit

865
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,750
more advanced searching reporting

866
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,930
commands right we talked about getting

867
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:16,970
into those those SPLs in creation of

868
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:18,560
knowledge objects and knowledge objects

869
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,089
are those rich things there's dashboards

870
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,130
with those units we talked about

871
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,830
transforming commands mentioned

872
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,450
transform was my favorite visualizations

873
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:27,920
right there's a lot of value and then I

874
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,480
think you have a filtering correlating

875
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,820
and data models the point is is this is

876
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,619
the next step in it now although not

877
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,539
necessarily free too

878
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:37,999
public and everybody well it does have a

879
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:41,029
really good program for veterans and so

880
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:43,399
if you are a veteran this second set of

881
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:46,430
training is also free and so I would

882
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:49,759
highly suggest you know taking advantage

883
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:52,399
of this if you are in an enterprise that

884
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:55,849
smoke is already at why not take the

885
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,490
free training if you are looking to

886
00:35:55,849 --> 00:36:01,069
learn more about slot Thank You hours

887
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:02,299
yes sir for posting up that link oh if

888
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:04,279
you're looking to learn more about it

889
00:36:02,299 --> 00:36:05,990
they sir these are things that you can

890
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:08,809
put on your LinkedIn right this is

891
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:10,848
marketable stuff it's one thing to say

892
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:12,200
that I've seen smoke what's another

893
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:13,490
thing to say that I've took some

894
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,140
training in it and I got a certification

895
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:17,328
and that actually does mean something

896
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:20,299
when you're looking at opportunities

897
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:23,210
it's like an analyst check it out

898
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:25,579
alright so sorry what some closing

899
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:29,299
remarks I always got a shell just a

900
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:31,220
little bit here but in my professional

901
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:33,319
opinion the key to success is you get

902
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,419
data in so we locate that source and we

903
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:37,430
tag it with the appropriate vendor stuff

904
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,680
out of base then we validate and verify

905
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:43,149
is it data correct and can you perform

906
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,779
basic searches on it okay you always

907
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:48,559
trust but verify

908
00:36:44,779 --> 00:36:50,210
oh then step three is gonna be build

909
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,940
those dashboards and reports this is

910
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:54,859
where you prove worth this is where you

911
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:58,339
make the investment into a piece of

912
00:36:54,859 --> 00:37:00,980
software actually pay for itself make

913
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:02,630
Splunk yours and then finally let's

914
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,700
deliver that success to management let's

915
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:09,380
get some huge wins here all right let's

916
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:12,049
show them why this tool or you know

917
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:14,779
really anything like it is going to make

918
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:16,999
sense of your data and bring value to

919
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:19,099
your company hopefully even protect you

920
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:22,970
to and alert you when bad things are

921
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:25,579
happening so what the hell do I do it

922
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,738

projects and staff augmentation and we

930
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,489
focus on you know

931
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:44,599
Splunk itself we also spoke to us on

932
00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:46,580
some of those premium modules like

933
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:48,260
enterprise security 90s I'd you

934
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,779
out of here's one cloud user and

935
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:52,190
phantoms for automation right and so

936
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,100
what are the things that I'm dealing

937
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:56,300
with a and yes you know I have to talk

938
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,220
about what I do but I want people to

939
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,560
also be inspired to seek out a

940
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:02,779
professional unk and smoke Enterprise

941
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,940
and smoke engineering because there's a

942
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,200
lot of fun doing this stuff right so I'm

943
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,710
doing architecture and I'm doing

944
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:13,189
migrations installations upgrades tuning

945
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:16,900
and helping other people you know take

946
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:18,890
all this massive amounts of big data and

947
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:22,400
parsing it and processing it and

948
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:25,910
enriching it such that it makes their

949
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:29,060
business better right it it is such a

950
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:32,629
cool thing to see the impact that you

951
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:35,090
can have on incorporation um you know

952
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,990
when I walk into an environment I try to

953
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,580
look at it from a health check

954
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,870
perspective so what is going on in your

955
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,370
architecture what are your

956
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:42,410
configurations look like well you're

957
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:43,730
absolutely cuz your licensing are you

958
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:45,140
clustered so all kinds of different

959
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,090
things and then I'm you know present

960
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,400
that is this is where we're at today me

961
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:51,080
this is your baseline how do we get to

962
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,300
that next step and let's build that road

963
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,740
forward so that you are happy with the

964
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:59,000
software you're happy with the product

965
00:38:54,740 --> 00:39:01,009
and you feel that experience in that

966
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,350
value is really you know adding to your

967
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:05,660
company so I wanted to take this

968
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:07,250
opportunity to you know as we wrap up

969
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,910
here to take the next five minutes

970
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:11,900
before in our next kind of thing here to

971
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:14,390
see if there's any questions out there

972
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:18,650
and I want to again say you know thank

973
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:21,440
you to the the B sides Greenville team I

974
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:23,830
live down in Florida but I have been to

975
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,640
Greenville it is a wonderful city and

976
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:29,900
again I mentioned I'm of a big

977
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,730
background in cybersecurity in besides

978
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:35,060
this one so so so we love to hear but I

979
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:37,880
see a question coming from from discord

980
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:40,070
here you've been given access to Splunk

981
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,440
and you want to watch over your digital

982
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,850
flock any other recommendations on where

983
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,160
to start beyond the fundamentals you

984
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:51,170
class especially schema searching good

985
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,420
folks references etc um so the big trick

986
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:55,490
is I think like anything else the more

987
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,360
you use something the more you get

988
00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:00,160
familiar with

989
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:03,200
the more all you get the opportunity to

990
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,399
learn about the little nuances and click

991
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,520
tricks and tips along the way so really

992
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,530
look at what other people are doing in

993
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,360
your field by bringing in some of those

994
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:16,730
apps with example dashboards when you

995
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,970
download the dashboard for instance for

996
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,980
Palo Alto it is full of what is capable

997
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:24,740
with pal amount of data and so you're

998
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:27,950
not left on your own to try to determine

999
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:29,689
it I like okay great I've got the logs

1000
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,080
now but how do i you know where do I

1001
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,730
start

1002
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,990
what's the first thing I should be

1003
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,030
looking for right I need some kind of

1004
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:38,419
direction here and so those apps are

1005
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:40,130
often going to help you build out some

1006
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,930
examples of potential directions you can

1007
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,360
go and you may find that those examples

1008
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:47,149
are very useful to ultimately building

1009
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:49,240
out your ideal dashboard of my Security
