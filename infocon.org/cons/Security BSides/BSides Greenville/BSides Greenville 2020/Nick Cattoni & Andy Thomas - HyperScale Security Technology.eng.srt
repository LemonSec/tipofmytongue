1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,120
so my name is nikkitoni

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,559
i'm uh asked for checkpoint uh here in

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,518
south carolina

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,320
i work with chris herron i focus mainly

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,480
on

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,520
commercial business um i've got andy

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,600
with me if you want to introduce

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,439
yourself

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,279
sir i'm andy thomas uh been with

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,759
checkpoint for about four years but was

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,359
a customer for about 20 years

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,399
done various i.t and security roles

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,399
in as a customer and uh

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,800
switched over to i guess they call it

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,760
the dark side the sales side but uh

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,800
hopefully uh we can um bring you some

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,239
information on

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,199
um just some some technologies that

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,480
we've seen that

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,280
uh benefit uh the scale that to keep up

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,078
with the cloud

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,079
in our data center

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,360
like andy said that today we're going to

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,399
talk about hyper-scale security

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,680
basically how we can use some of that

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,199
same hyperscale

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,240
um methodology from data centers

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,960
and apply that to scaling on our

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
traditional

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,798
network security um so i'm gonna try to

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,679
keep that product stuff to a minimum but

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,680
i think you know

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
one of the things we see is that

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,520
scalable solutions are

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,880
you know not a new thing in the cyber

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,240
security world

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
i think you know we just want to show

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,960
you kind of a unique way that

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,759
uh the problem can be handled but also

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,000
in a way that's

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,520
much more cost effective so at the end

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,240
of the powerpoint we're going to have a

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,360
uh q a section you know feel free to

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,039
unmute your mics

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,000
we'd love to you know talk to you or

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,920
answer any questions that you might have

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
so that'll roll into it

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
so i want to start with the pro typical

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,360
conversation organizations

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,799
look to move to the cloud so the

51
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,479
more and more customers are increasing

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,040
their footprint in the cloud and whether

53
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,960
that's sas

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,719
applications or putting infrastructure

55
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,559
up there and it seems that

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,919
every business now is in the cloud in

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,840
some manner

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,439
usually the ones that tell you they're

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
not change their mind once you start

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,280
asking about

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,640
office 365 or backup solutions

62
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,040
stuff like that so the main reasons this

63
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,399
is

64
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,480
you know look to take on the cloud

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,720
transformation is the productivity

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,079
so users are able to you know access

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
information from anywhere

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,760
they're using this technology or the

69
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,200
newest versions of software

70
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,959
that's going to enable the business to

71
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,238
be more agile

72
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,840
i think you know this is the perfect

73
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,200
time in the market to show why it's you

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,200
know important to be able to respond

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,238
quickly to changes

76
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,079
so cost other factor

77
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,160
uh cost can really be an advantage or

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,920
disadvantage if you hear a lot of people

79
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
you know moving to the cloud and it ends

80
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,119
up you know costing 10

81
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,000
cost but if an organization can utilize

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,720
a cloud infrastructure efficiently it's

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,920
going to lead to

84
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,000
better performance and cost savings

85
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,440
cobit again is another great example of

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,959
how businesses can

87
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,879
you know that are in the cloud more of

88
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,879
the ability to scale down

89
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,399
and really just utilize the resources

90
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,879
that you need rather than having all

91
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,080
that overhead of uh

92
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,799
you know maintain data center which is

93
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,920
going to

94
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,200
you know play right into the

95
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,839
topic of flexibility

96
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,200
but going to a public strategy it's not

97
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,239
always the perfect solution

98
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,959
um you know it's not draw free

99
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,239
so the organization is going to lose all

100
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,599
over the hardware

101
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,680
you're trusting all your data in the

102
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,560
hands is a new challenge for security

103
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
teams

104
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,519
they're going to have to adapt to new

105
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,120
strategy they're going to have to secure

106
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,640
the cloud environment

107
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,400
you're going to keep track of your

108
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,599
assets in the cloud

109
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,080
but you're also going to have all of

110
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,760
that traffic going from the cloud

111
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,680
or sorry from your on-prem data center

112
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,640
or from your users to the cloud and

113
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,000
that's another thing that you need to

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,439
keep in mind about

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,799
you know being handled and then

116
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,879
last thing to point out is unless a

117
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,480
company is born in the cloud

118
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,079
you know i mean they started up there

119
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,480
and that's really what they've got it's

120
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,400
it's hard to see customers cutting the

121
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,720
top you know all ties to the

122
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,720
center

123
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,040
you take a look at some recent trends

124
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,280
it's clear to see

125
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,880
why the public cloud is or it's clear to

126
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,320
see that the public cloud is being used

127
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,960
to complement on-prem

128
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
data centers or private clouds so you

129
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,479
see 87

130
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,159
of organizations are using some form of

131
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,000
hybrid cloud strategy

132
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,280
with major enterprises conducting a

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,199
majority of their workloads

134
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,440
in the data or private clouds

135
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,880
so you know another piece that plays

136
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,719
into that is mentioning that a lot of

137
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,120
organizations have to battle compliance

138
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,880
moving to the cloud so with a large

139
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
amount of workloads remaining

140
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,040
in the on-prem data center how can we

141
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,040
put a security solution in place that

142
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,759
has cloud-like scalability

143
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,520
to the data center needs so the

144
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,000
scalability of network gateways has

145
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,320
always been

146
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,840
difficult to achieve you've got devices

147
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,360
that end up needing to be replaced by

148
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,198
better ones

149
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,039
i think they say network traffic we're

150
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,880
seeing like almost a three times

151
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,800
increase every single you know year over

152
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,159
year um so you're you know constantly

153
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,160
having to replace network

154
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,320
devices to keep up with you know the

155
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,199
needs of the data center

156
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,199
and also you have high availability um

157
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,000
as an issue you know redundancy is such

158
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,000
a huge benefit that the cloud offers

159
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
um but when you know a lot of times

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,680
you're securing with traditional network

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,080
you know static network devices you have

162
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,199
that issue of hey one of these things is

163
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,840
you know sit in h.a and it's not doing

164
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,680
anything

165
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,960
you know it feels like a waste of money

166
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,800
um so what we're going to talk about a

167
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,599
little bit later is kind of a unique

168
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,120
way to address this problem use true n

169
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,360
plus one solution really something where

170
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,160
we can just keep adding resources

171
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,039
um address the scalability but all done

172
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,360
this

173
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,960
question by eliminating those idle

174
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
resources that are that are not doing

175
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,280
anything

176
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,280
so this is where hyperscale technology

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,800
comes into play

178
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,599
um so definition of hyperscale just to

179
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,360
kind of read it off

180
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,759
it's the ability of a technology

181
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
architecture to improve and scale

182
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,240
appropriately

183
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,400
as per demand is added to the system so

184
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,319
you know we see this with facebook with

185
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,799
the googles the netflix you know these

186
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,960
huge hyperscale data centers that can

187
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,639
just grow and grow and grow

188
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,880
basically you know we're looking at how

189
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,440
can we take that same concept that hyper

190
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,400
data centers use and apply that to the

191
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,840
traditional

192
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,520
data center uh security market and so

193
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,039
what that's going to do is if we can

194
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,400
achieve that it gives us a solution that

195
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,240
has incredibly high levels of

196
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,840
performance or throughput

197
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,400
while still having that redundancy that

198
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,400
we talked about

199
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,159
so scalable platform we kind of

200
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
mentioned in the beginning

201
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,240
it's you know everybody has some way of

202
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,440
having a scalable solution to handle

203
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,080
security needs

204
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,280
um it's not new in the industry and so

205
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,479
while many vendors us

206
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,840
included all our chassis solutions these

207
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,639
are really targeted for those huge

208
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,080
enterprises

209
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,240
that really just need tons and tons of

210
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
time

211
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,639
and so chassis solutions are too

212
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,479
expensive for mid-size businesses

213
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,720
and you know for a smaller mid-size

214
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,560
business you don't need a hundred gigs

215
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,120
of you know throughput at the firewall

216
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,120
so it's just it's overkill anyway

217
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,319
so what we're going to go into is you

218
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,800
know kind of talking about a new

219
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,280
platform that we have called maestro

220
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,440
which basically uses regular appliances

221
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,758
rather than a blade architecture

222
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,520
so it's bringing all the benefits of

223
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,039
scalable platform solutions to a

224
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,080
business of any size so it doesn't

225
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,639
matter if you have

226
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,440
you know a couple hundred employees or

227
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,440
you have

228
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,319
you know 50 000 employees you're going

229
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,440
to have the ability to stay

230
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,080
at that huge upfront cost of traditional

231
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,759
chassis

232
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,719
solutions and so there's various use

233
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,360
cases where

234
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,720
having a scalable solution based on just

235
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,479
normal appliances

236
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,840
is beneficial and one of the

237
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,120
going to be for obviously customers like

238
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,280
we talked about that want scalability

239
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,639
but the chassis is just just too big

240
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,039
gets them in an entry cost gives you the

241
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
you know the ability to

242
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,639
long term know that you're not going to

243
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,800
have to rip and replace your gateways

244
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,240
um but you know without that huge front

245
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
cost of the chassis

246
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,479
on the flip side it's kind of the exact

247
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
opposite of everything we talked about

248
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,280
which is

249
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,319
you know very very large enterprises can

250
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,878
can use this

251
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,680
um so if you've got you know massive

252
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,640
companies where chassis solutions are

253
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,320
you need multiple chassis solutions this

254
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,479
is a way to achieve

255
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,000
you know significantly more throughput

256
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,479
without the complexity

257
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,399
of managing and using all of those

258
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,680
chassis solutions so

259
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,760
using normal normal gateways

260
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,279
we can we can actually get about 10

261
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,600
times the throughput that some of these

262
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,000
chassis solutions are able to offer

263
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,880
and then you know we talked about

264
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,839
managing

265
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,360
or i mentioned managing multiple classes

266
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,160
that's kind of the last customer that

267
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,800
really

268
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,760
you know this use case makes sense to um

269
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,599
and that's for people that want to

270
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,240
consolidate resources

271
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,279
under the same management platform so

272
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
you know the whole

273
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,120
you know one of the huge benefits to a

274
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,600
hyperscale data center is saying hey

275
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,040
you know we have that automation we have

276
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,200
the ability to just keep adding

277
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,160
resources and have the environment scale

278
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
to us

279
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,360
um you know if we apply this to security

280
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,279
it's not

281
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,360
not useful if it means you know a huge

282
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,160
headache and management so

283
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,080
there's a way that we can you know keep

284
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,839
same scalability but just keep

285
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,240
you know adding on to it while keeping

286
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,640
management um you know just a single

287
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,920
single object and so from there i'm

288
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,480
actually break the share for a minute

289
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,439
and head over

290
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,600
andy um who has some you know more

291
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,560
slides on exactly how we can kind of

292
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,160
take another look at how to handle you

293
00:09:50,560 --> 00:10:05,040
know a question that has traditionally

294
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:08,719
caused the headaches

295
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,719
so let me get started here

296
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,279
so good setup nick um appreciate it um

297
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,719
you'll you'll hear me probably be

298
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,800
redundant in some of the

299
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,959
statements nick made but uh just to

300
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,920
reiterate some of them so

301
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,959
he touched briefly on why why we need

302
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,920
hyperscale

303
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,319
um we should just put this why do we

304
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,560
need more capacity in the data center

305
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,560
i was told whenever everyone was started

306
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,439
to go to the cloud

307
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,199
uh that there would no longer be any

308
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,120
need for inspection of

309
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,880
you know hardware appliances or

310
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,000
inspection

311
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,959
and i don't as much as people are moving

312
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,279
to the cloud and

313
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,719
some of that will probably dissipate

314
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,399
over time

315
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,240
there's new requirements when you shift

316
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,600
your data center to the cloud or

317
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,120
your compute or storage whenever you

318
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,519
shift that to the cloud you still have

319
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,680
your

320
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,560
a lot of you companies have users on

321
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,959
premise

322
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,560
kind of changing with codefood but you

323
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,319
still have a lot of users that are still

324
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,880
going to the cloud you have to inspect

325
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,120
the whole

326
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,560
entire cloud every connection

327
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,320
essentially that goes to the cloud

328
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,560
because the cloud's untrusted that's the

329
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,320
point or the internet rather

330
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,760
so um you also have people that'll

331
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,160
always have on-prem um

332
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,920
networks maybe not always but at least

333
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,000
for the foreseeable future

334
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,000
and with that you want east-west

335
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,920
inspection there's a variety of needs of

336
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,680
doing network inspection now

337
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,680
with the modern data center and the

338
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,920
modern way of computing

339
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,359
things are being distributed branch

340
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,959
offices

341
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,880
people aren't backhauling everything

342
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,479
back to the data center

343
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,560
people are working from starbucks so

344
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,680
that communication may or may not be

345
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,239
inspected by a network device it may

346
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,519
be that you just depend on uh the

347
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,639
endpoint agent

348
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,800
but yet even with that maybe you're

349
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,720
doing remote access to get access to the

350
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,839
corporate internal corporate resources

351
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
and when you do that you're going to

352
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,880
need capacity

353
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,200
for that vpn connection or the

354
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,639
inspection that goes with that so

355
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,079
things are shifting for sure but what we

356
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,760
found is what we

357
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,439
the benefit of what we've learned from

358
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,160
the cloud and how it's

359
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:31,040
been scalable we felt like that same

360
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,040
method could be

361
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,720
used in the data center and and again i

362
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,560
don't want to get too much in what

363
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,440
checkpoint is doing here this is really

364
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,359
an industry

365
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,000
problem it's a unique way that

366
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,480
checkpoint is

367
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,600
to address a solution but really this is

368
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,320
a problem that's

369
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,519
industry wide and and other vendors have

370
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,200
other solutions

371
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,720
most of them what we've found is in the

372
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,760
chassis so

373
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,480
um back to what hyperscale is or why we

374
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,360
need it

375
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,560
you know the un unpredictable traffic

376
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,279
patterns that i mentioned here on the

377
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,920
slide

378
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,560
just the increase of usage um you see

379
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,120
the

380
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,518
seasonal patterns you know holiday

381
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,920
shopping is a perfect example and

382
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,440
you know how how things may ramp up on

383
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,719
e-commerce during that time

384
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,639
and and and take away from other

385
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,160
not take away from other resources but

386
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,839
add to what's also going

387
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,480
on in your shops uh you know physical

388
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,519
stores

389
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,160
brick and mortars um but that's a shift

390
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,279
in traffic it's a burst and then a

391
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,360
in a down downgrade and

392
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,279
and that's what we see the benefit of of

393
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,000
cloud that's one of its

394
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,839
uh hallmarks is its agility to both flex

395
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,760
up and flex down as needed

396
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,079
you also see new applications coming

397
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,439
online that really spike the usage i'll

398
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,760
give an example

399
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,440
of you know five years ago or no

400
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,240
no it's probably been about seven years

401
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,560
ago when i first as a customer thought

402
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,839
okay i need to start doing this

403
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,839
next-gen firewall consolidation surfaces

404
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,079
i don't want to be managing a proxy

405
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,079
and a firewall and an ips i want to

406
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,319
consolidate those and when i did

407
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,760
it was about the same time office 365

408
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,000
was being turned up

409
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,680
and so at the same time i had to size my

410
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,440
gateways for

411
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
the change in how i was going to do

412
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,959
things because i felt like that was the

413
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
best use of my resources i didn't have a

414
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,760
huge team to manage three different

415
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,880
appliance

416
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,639
solutions i wanted to do it all in one

417
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,240
and it was the right decision for us but

418
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,040
with that being said

419
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,880
as this office 365 we didn't get good

420
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,040
metrics on what the traffic flows would

421
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,199
be we sized our boxes appropriate

422
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,439
and pretty much nailed it except for one

423
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,199
instance we had problems in europe and

424
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,040
there was just it was just

425
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,760
hard to manage that uh traffic had to do

426
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,760
some

427
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,079
load sharing on our gateways and kind of

428
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,240
limp along until the next budget cycle

429
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,199
came along which isn't isn't always

430
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,959
practical

431
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,199
and that was more of a branch office

432
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,000
type of use case but it still applies

433
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,319
the idea is

434
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,519
you get locked into the appliances and

435
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,600
you're pretty much

436
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,040
either you buy way over more capacity to

437
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,000
what you need for the next

438
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,839
five years or or or you don't have

439
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,519
enough capacity and you have to rip and

440
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,399
replace your solutions

441
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,040
so for that for that solution it would

442
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,600
have been

443
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,399
great to have an alternative like this

444
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
uh

445
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,680
a scalable platform that allows you to

446
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,680
uh

447
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,000
you know grow the solution without

448
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,599
having to to rip in place

449
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
as i mentioned the movement of the cloud

450
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,920
isn't limited to sas

451
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,519
which that was my use case but uh you

452
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,199
know infrastructure service

453
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,680
huge that's really a lot of your data

454
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,359
center moving out to to the cloud

455
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,719
and then platform as a service and

456
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,360
there's going to be

457
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,160
uh you know as a service i think it's

458
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,839
infinite of the

459
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,000
the message that we're going to be

460
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,839
putting stuff in the cloud

461
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,040
but as i mentioned that whole

462
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,880
consolidate

463
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,480
consolidation of network security

464
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,759
inspection um

465
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,600
that drives up the need and maybe maybe

466
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,279
a lot of company what we find is they

467
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,240
don't they start off and they'll maybe

468
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,399
consolidate

469
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:11,199
you know like i did ips and and proxy

470
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,120
or or some other function dlp but when

471
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,800
they do a lot of times they don't do the

472
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,759
ssl part of it and then so they need ssl

473
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
turned on

474
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,880
inspection turned on so where are you

475
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,880
going to get the capacity for that

476
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,079
you're going to go out and buy another

477
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,199
aj pair

478
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,399
just to handle to bigger to handle this

479
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:33,519
um that's been the old methodology so

480
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,800
we're looking at um you know kind of

481
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,279
turning that up and

482
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,319
and in in the right situations coming up

483
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,880
with something

484
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,120
that you don't necessarily have to keep

485
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,519
ripping and replacing upgrading

486
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,759
um gateways and you don't have to buy a

487
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,360
full-on chassis to grow

488
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:54,800
uh that you have options

489
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,320
um you know just to fully complete that

490
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,079
you know some of the other ideas like

491
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,399
the remote access i have on the list

492
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,638
here that's another thing that's dried

493
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,000
driven more uh the more capacity

494
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
requirements is coveted more

495
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,559
people are working from home so that

496
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,520
could have been a perfect use case

497
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,559
for why you would need a extendable

498
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,918
solution

499
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,000
where you're not locked into where you

500
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,400
could add capacity maybe

501
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,679
maybe you've got all this set up and

502
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,799
configured

503
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,919
and remote access was one of your

504
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:29,360
deployments in a in a

505
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,559
an orchestrated type of solution

506
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:35,120
um that like in in meister's case

507
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,879
all you would add need to do is throw in

508
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,479
another gateway

509
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,160
so just examples of why we need it i

510
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,559
think everybody understands that we're

511
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,039
just

512
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,080
we're um trying to catch up with um

513
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,760
catch up with something that's

514
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,120
impossible to catch up with i mean it's

515
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,760
just constantly

516
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,760
um we're chasing security essentially

517
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,439
so why do i need an alternative to a

518
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,520
chassis it's a chassis as

519
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,640
uh nick mentioned chassis have been the

520
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,039
solution

521
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,400
for uh scalable capacity ads

522
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,039
and they're done through blades you

523
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,559
basically have a switch in a device

524
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,760
that distributes the traffic to multiple

525
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,280
uh blade security gateways

526
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,280
they're essentially blades within the

527
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,799
hardware and

528
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,879
you know a lot of times you're limited

529
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,760
to eight or ten slot how many are slots

530
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,280
whatever size

531
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,400
the chassis is and that's been

532
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,440
effective on really large organizations

533
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,720
but it's it's extremely costly to get in

534
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,640
to a chassis and um

535
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,200
and how do you do it did you fully

536
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,520
populate start off with or

537
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,880
you know that that can really get

538
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,799
expensive

539
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,400
that's why i mentioned the entry cost to

540
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,000
that for smaller orgs they didn't have

541
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,400
an option there was no large

542
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,480
there was no small chassis there were

543
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,960
usually two options

544
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,039
more of a medium and a large but it just

545
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,080
does it practical for most

546
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,280
uh businesses and you know

547
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,399
even within that you're still an lha

548
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,480
model even on the

549
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,520
you know high availability within the

550
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,919
chassis

551
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,240
you do have some of the n plus one type

552
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,160
of aj capabilities built in within the

553
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,720
chassis but that's another thing that

554
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,480
you know what we're talking about here

555
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,000
what what checkpoint has done is put

556
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,679
basically a switch in the top

557
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,480
of a rack and then allowed you to fill

558
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,720
up that rack with as many gateways

559
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,640
uh i wouldn't say as you want but there

560
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,720
you'll see the limitations

561
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,080
uh but much more than what you could

562
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,080
actually fit in the

563
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,280
chassis so therefore the throughputs are

564
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,439
much higher than even a

565
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,160
a chassis so you can start small

566
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,679
where you can grow in to it um and then

567
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,240
you have the ability to auto scale

568
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,480
there's

569
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,520
orchestration built into the system to

570
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,760
you know just like the cloud you ought

571
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,480
to

572
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,480
automatically add resources and up

573
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,320
upscale and downscale

574
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,240
um based on capacity requirements based

575
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,320
on thresholds and we'll see a demo later

576
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,320
on

577
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,000
so this is an example of just some of

578
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,600
the throughputs

579
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,720
uh that you can get so

580
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,000
almost a terabyte of throughput some of

581
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,280
this is theoretical

582
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,360
but it's still a significant

583
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,120
amount of any amount of traffic

584
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,000
throughput inspection that you can get

585
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,799
from

586
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,400
a chassis platform pardon me

587
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,840
uh so the auto scaling um can be for

588
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,760
your traffic going to the cloud or

589
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,840
branch offices uh

590
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,200
really the use cases we'll talk about a

591
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,199
little bit more

592
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,320
um you have a restful api that allows

593
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,320
for the orchestration

594
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,039
as you can see here you've got up links

595
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,280
and downlinks as you would imagine and

596
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:02,960
uh your downlinks or 10 40 or 100

597
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,720
gig and your uplinks the uh the same

598
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,039
but you just have the ability to

599
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,799
basically uh

600
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,799
the user communication goes to the

601
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,158
switch and that's distributed between

602
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,440
the gateways

603
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:19,919
um and we keep

604
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:23,120
session management synced up um

605
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,880
each lot a group of appliances are put

606
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,559
into what they call a security group

607
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,000
and that security group is safe

608
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,360
basically what you would have in a

609
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,880
gateway instance so security group one

610
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,840
would be an inspection for one

611
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,200
particular

612
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,080
use case and group two in this slide

613
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
would be for

614
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,760
another particular use case um it would

615
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,360
just be

616
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,360
you know you if you have multiple

617
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,439
firewalls on your floor that would be

618
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,799
each one of those would relate to that

619
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,000
that firewall

620
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,918
instance that you have for you know

621
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,360
maybe you have one for finance maybe one

622
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,360
have one for

623
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:03,600
e-commerce that kind of division

624
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,600
and here's some of the specifics on the

625
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,959
just the limitations single management

626
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,080
object is basically just a way to talk

627
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,840
to a single

628
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,840
security group and manage it

629
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,840
so there's a load balancing map uh

630
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,678
mechanism that distributes the load

631
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:27,439
equally and you're in plus one it it uh

632
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,039
it basically pretty much raid fives of

633
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,080
traffic similar to what you would do in

634
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,720
disk

635
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,000
um you you're you're putting everything

636
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,200
across

637
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,320
those um across the gateways

638
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,200
that you have to to send the load to

639
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,960
and you need basically one to handle

640
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,840
redundancy you lose one you still have

641
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,919
the same capacity

642
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,879
uh that it's load balanced through a

643
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,480
dynamic

644
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,919
uh algorithm and it's has to do with

645
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:02,240
basically the five tuple type of

646
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,840
criteria there's a correction to ensure

647
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,880
that there's no asymmetric

648
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,399
uh communication so that's obviously a

649
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,919
problem whenever you're doing something

650
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,440
like this it's not like you're just

651
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,280
talking to one device you're talking to

652
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,840
a

653
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,799
multiple we we have software to actually

654
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,879
handle that

655
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:25,440
um basically that uh making sure that we

656
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,159
can keep up with the connection across

657
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,159
the gateways

658
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,120
so just some dynamic scalability

659
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,360
requirements that come from our

660
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,439
different business units

661
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,879
you have um shops for example

662
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,640
this is done from our israel

663
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,159
counterparts you know

664
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,440
shops is more of a european term but

665
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:55,120
you know any of our e-commerce or

666
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,200
um brick-and-mortar type of stores big

667
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,639
box stores whatever they may be

668
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,039
you telco's a great use case

669
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,600
government you know you know i could

670
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,279
only imagine some of the

671
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,439
systems that have had to come online for

672
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,360
the government to support

673
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,559
covert coveted what's going on in the

674
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,158
world would uh

675
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:20,158
require dynamic uh significant

676
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,720
uh increases of of dynamic traffic

677
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,679
transportation companies just a few uh

678
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,960
there's

679
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,520
so many different use cases um i

680
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,600
support a hospital and they're very

681
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,158
interested in it because

682
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,240
where some some organizations

683
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,640
decentralize with branch office on their

684
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,600
their

685
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,000
their model is to centralize the traffic

686
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,639
uh

687
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,080
coming all their inspection coming from

688
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,279
all their employees going out

689
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,320
a single inter one or two internet pops

690
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,080
so with that uh consolidation of all

691
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,279
that traffic coming through means that

692
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,720
you gotta have

693
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,720
you know large inspection to be done

694
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,600
so

695
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,960
so here's an example of just a couple

696
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,719
different security groups and the

697
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,799
unassigned gateways

698
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,120
you can assign reassign these gateways

699
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,760
based on on thresholds

700
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,120
so essentially what happens to it we

701
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,120
don't really call this out that

702
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,559
that that much in these slides but

703
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,399
essentially what happens you can

704
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,918
manually move these things by a simple

705
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,200
web interface

706
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,919
but essentially what happens on the auto

707
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,960
scale

708
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,640
is you set threshold policy and if

709
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,600
a certain security group it's over

710
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,720
50 cpu utilization you pick your own

711
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,959
thresholds

712
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,720
if you get to that you say okay things

713
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,360
are gonna happen here where i need to

714
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,600
move in more resources

715
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,360
it automatically does that for you and

716
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,240
again that's what we'll show in the demo

717
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,799
here

718
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,799
in a minute

719
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,120
so here's an example okay so

720
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,960
you're um i'm not sure the significance

721
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,678
of this 30 here but

722
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,240
uh you've got you've got threshold set

723
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,840
your

724
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,480
uh 70 is the threshold um

725
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,158
62 it looks like it's at right now you

726
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,440
add the other gateway

727
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,440
and now you're down to 25

728
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,400
so again the benefits are it's more for

729
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,559
any business

730
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
there were limitations and scales

731
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,760
solutions to really large companies who

732
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,240
could

733
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,158
purchase really large chassis and that

734
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,159
has been an inhibitor and it's not been

735
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,320
fair it's not been a

736
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,159
fair playing field for for smaller

737
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,879
companies to not really have an

738
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,919
option but to keep having to buy rip and

739
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,159
replace gateways based on capacity aids

740
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,039
again buying way more capacity than what

741
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,000
they

742
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,760
uh actually need at the time and just

743
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,799
letting it sit

744
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,640
or buying it more

745
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,720
right sizing and then finding out

746
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,080
because a new application comes along or

747
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,760
there's a shift that uh that there's

748
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,240
gonna be

749
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,039
enough capacity i mean just just being

750
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,880
into those

751
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,960
in that situation it's just not a good

752
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,000
solution with this

753
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,679
you hit with um a scalable platform top

754
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,400
of the rack you got a switch that you

755
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,320
put in

756
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,320
you just uh add gateways in as needed to

757
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,158
address capacity it gives them much more

758
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,320
flexibility

759
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,279
i mean andy if you don't mind if i add a

760
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,360
point to that i think

761
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,640
absolutely one of the you know benefits

762
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,639
i like as you can see kind of on your

763
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,080
slide there the start from little

764
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,679
um you know it uses using the same

765
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,199
technology that you're already gonna you

766
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,279
know have securing

767
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,440
you know that network meaning you can

768
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,880
start at a right size solution and then

769
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,880
find out later that you need the

770
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,960
scalable solution and add that

771
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,159
on down the road so you don't have to go

772
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,640
you know all

773
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,760
in on you know a scalable solution right

774
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,279
off the bat

775
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,039
you can you know just protect these

776
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,080
assets like normal

777
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,240
and then put in a scalable solution

778
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,360
the other piece of that is you know andy

779
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,120
talked about

780
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,479
you know new inspection you find out you

781
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,158
have to do let's say all of a sudden you

782
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,279
decide you know the organization decides

783
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,399
that you need to inspect

784
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,600
you know us to sell traffic you can also

785
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,039
you know instead of having if you're in

786
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,439
a chassis solution instead of having to

787
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,158
buy an incredibly expensive you know

788
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,320
additional blade to to run that you can

789
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,480
just put even a smaller gateway and so

790
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,720
you might have two large gateways

791
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,240
and then you know let's just add a

792
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,960
little bit more on top of it to be able

793
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,919
to handle

794
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,440
the needs that we need so it i think you

795
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,760
know those two things are worth pointing

796
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,679
out

797
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,200
for showing you know how this really can

798
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,360
help not

799
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,360
not the giants you know how it can help

800
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,158
the your average businesses

801
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,000
handle the scalability problem andy you

802
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,760
gave the example of the offices in

803
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,799
europe generating more traffic than

804
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,799
expected

805
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,158
do you provide an inspection solution

806
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,840
that does not require

807
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,760
the traffic in europe to come back to

808
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,000
the usa

809
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,960
yeah in that example that's exactly what

810
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,960
it was and this

811
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,799
is not like we're doing this in cloud

812
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,840
this is on premise

813
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:09,200
so this was actually the the european

814
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,320
uh gateways were sitting in europe um

815
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,240
[Music]

816
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,439
so yeah it didn't have to come back to

817
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,840
the u.s

818
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,159
we were just uh the company i was with

819
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,639
was we were distributed

820
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,000
um but we had regional data centers and

821
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,159
since then they've

822
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,159
done even branching out to where they

823
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,559
have more of a

824
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,440
direct internet access from their branch

825
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,480
offices

826
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,000
but those regional offices kind of

827
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,679
provided failover

828
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,240
if there was a failure in the in the

829
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,640
direct internet access at the branches

830
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,640
but with that said they still had those

831
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,480
regional data centers they had dmz's

832
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,720
they had other capacity requirements

833
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,240
other than just outbound user traffic so

834
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,480
you had inbound

835
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,840
but the the point is is where it was

836
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,840
really pushing

837
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,158
uh really pushing the need for more

838
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,000
it was putting office 365 that was the

839
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,240
one single solution that

840
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,320
or problem that was introduced that

841
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,480
really caused the need for

842
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,840
uh additional capacity there but does

843
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,840
that make sense

844
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,279
yes thank you sure so

845
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,678
um nick makes a great point too there's

846
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,799
so much flexibility in this and the fact

847
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,640
that when we started out

848
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,320
we were limited to certain models that

849
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,559
could participate

850
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,559
um to explain this orchestrator that

851
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,240
happened something that happens too that

852
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,559
we kind of flew through and didn't touch

853
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,480
on it essentially what happens in this

854
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,320
orchestration process is

855
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,080
you've got auto scaling which i i'm

856
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,158
going to again show that demo but you

857
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,918
can manually move stuff around

858
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,520
through this web interface that you'll

859
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:48,320
see but

860
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:51,120
um with with that said

861
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,840
what happens when you actually move a a

862
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,279
un

863
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,918
um untagged resource

864
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,960
a gateway that's unused into a security

865
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,840
group

866
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,159
we basically deploy the code the proper

867
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,199
code it could have a release of

868
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,840
software on it that is not current

869
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,440
maybe it's newer or older it doesn't

870
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,799
matter when it's moved in that security

871
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,840
group that's wiped out and it's

872
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,480
re-imaged

873
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,840
with the proper software version and it

874
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,440
receives the policy

875
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,120
for that security group and all this

876
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,480
happens automatically through the

877
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,279
orchestrator

878
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,640
and another gateway that associates uh

879
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,360
that deployment

880
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,200
um that that all happens within like a

881
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:35,199
five minute process

882
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,919
uh and again we'll see that in an auto

883
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,600
auto deploy environment what's also cool

884
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,200
about this is when we started out you

885
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
were limited to certain

886
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,559
gateway models we've opened it up to all

887
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,918
our currently supported gateway models

888
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,678
and it used to be uh that particular

889
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,679
gateway models had to be identical

890
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,960
within a security group

891
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,360
um that is that is a limitation now but

892
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,279
soon

893
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,360
it won't be a limitation so what was

894
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,640
really cool is theoretically what you

895
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,840
can do is you can

896
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,960
migrate to all new newer models without

897
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,678
any downtime

898
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,760
all you do is just move the new models

899
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,240
in the gateways take the old ones out

900
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,080
so that's one use case of the benefits

901
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,320
of this whole orchestration

902
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,760
so you don't really have to do anything

903
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,360
other than just hook the stuff

904
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,240
up and and move it over and it

905
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,918
automatically repopulates all this stuff

906
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,760
and this is this is the way stuff is

907
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,039
done in the cloud it's automatically

908
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:31,200
provisioned it's

909
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,080
it's auto scaling like you see in azure

910
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,080
and aws

911
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,158
so um we're really trying to take the

912
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,600
idea we took more from google of how

913
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,760
they

914
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,918
took and put us you know how they

915
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,399
distributed stuff they use the

916
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,039
what we call a top of the rack switch

917
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,000
and then

918
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,799
put all these devices uh connected them

919
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,480
all together

920
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:58,320
in a single system so i'm gonna

921
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,799
i'm gonna do this demo there it is

922
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,918
i'm deciding well i think we have time i

923
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,918
think i'm just going to let the whole

924
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,559
thing run it takes about five minutes

925
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,399
it's the actual process it's real time

926
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,158
so you get to see the full thing

927
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,518
it gets kind of dead at some time

928
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,519
nothing's happening

929
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,039
you'll if you want to shoot some

930
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,559
questions while that's going on where

931
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,039
there's not much happening

932
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,120
feel free to i'll probably fill in with

933
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,600
some commentary as well but

934
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,719
let's just get at it and let you see

935
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,719
what it what it can do

936
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:38,480
so what you see here is um

937
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:42,159
two gateways already in a particular uh

938
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,720
group security group configuration

939
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,720
and it has no auto scala settings so

940
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,960
we're turning on auto scaling here

941
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,039
and we're adding the configuration for

942
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,600
it so it's telling it what to do

943
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,559
in a scale-up situation if there's more

944
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,678
than 70

945
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:00,960
cpu or consecutive

946
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,559
60 seconds then we're changing to 30

947
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,399
there to speed things up

948
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,239
but um well actually just change to 50.

949
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,679
i'll let it i'll let the screen tell you

950
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,918
i don't have it memorized

951
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,320
all those parameters but as you can see

952
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,359
this is your scale down rule here

953
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,359
and you've got a couple different

954
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:21,839
parameters what you what you actually

955
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,839
scale down or scale up on

956
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,040
so that's set so now they're gonna start

957
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:49,520
sending traffic to it

958
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:52,000
to change the behavior

959
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,199
so as you can see the cpu utilizations

960
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,599
and and the average

961
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:59,919
for the two gateways so it's 44 now

962
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,800
so it's this is kind of the wait time

963
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,400
it's got to

964
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,359
hit be that at that criteria for a

965
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,359
certain amount of seconds

966
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,920
so we're looking for a scale-up event so

967
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:21,440
watch the top one

968
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,720
so there's 30 seconds

969
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,440
all right now we're going to start

970
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,839
seeing the other system

971
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,480
come online with the unused system

972
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,920
that's our

973
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,440
uh being automatically added to the

974
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,400
scale group

975
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,400
or the security group

976
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:45,839
see it added into the gui populates

977
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,680
so you see the node detached it's

978
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:06,560
getting its configuration now

979
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,560
and this is kind of where it gets boring

980
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,119
any questions about what's going on in

981
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,200
the screen or anything is it

982
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:18,000
clear i'll point out here

983
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,000
you see this this is the version this sp

984
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,320
is a scalable platform operating system

985
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,599
that runs

986
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,520
you got two of three sgm's or security

987
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,920
gateways

988
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,160
ssms or security switches or

989
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,599
orchestrators

990
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,720
you got two in use but three in the

991
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,480
security group

992
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,839
so that's that's the point of this two

993
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,839
and the three here

994
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,598
you get the policy firewall policy

995
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,520
update so that's what's going to get

996
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,520
deployed the firewall policy with that

997
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,839
date

998
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:04,480
again this is all happening you think if

999
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,759
you if you need this on the cloud

1000
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,400
and you're doing um

1001
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,119
you're doing inspection you're going to

1002
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,079
have to have

1003
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,440
the ability to scale up automatically

1004
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,359
on-prem

1005
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,880
as well either that or run way over

1006
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,520
capacity again

1007
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,200
you get the benefits of moving resources

1008
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,119
around another point

1009
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,279
i didn't make earlier too is on the

1010
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,359
whole portability of the gateways maybe

1011
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,119
nick touched on it but that you have the

1012
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,520
ability to not only use these gateways

1013
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,680
you could

1014
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,079
use them in an orchestrator and all that

1015
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:40,078
and maybe your orchestrator is good

1016
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,240
your your maestro solution it's good

1017
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,920
you can take and use that gateway take

1018
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,359
it and send it to a branch office or

1019
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,960
something like that you can pull them

1020
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,640
out of here obviously there really

1021
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,320
there's no special

1022
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,480
they're the same gateways that you buy

1023
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,480
for

1024
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:57,280
non-orchestrated environments as well so

1025
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,720
that gives you a more flexible

1026
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,400
investment right

1027
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,359
and just gives you um

1028
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,079
you know an environment that you can

1029
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,279
customize

1030
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,920
and use as you need so it's got the

1031
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,040
policy

1032
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:17,040
it's rebooting now

1033
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,040
as a policy in the new software update

1034
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,680
you still see it up here on expired on

1035
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,880
everything

1036
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,720
but it's in the scale unit you're still

1037
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,760
you're running still hot on these two

1038
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,759
members is

1039
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
um

1040
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,440
and participants are automatically muted

1041
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,839
when they join the meeting

1042
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,839
but participants do have the ability to

1043
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,839
unmute themselves to ask a question

1044
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,839
great thanks

1045
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:53,920
now you see things average out average

1046
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,078
cp utilization is going to come

1047
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,839
more normalized as load gets distributed

1048
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,839
to that third unit

1049
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,280
and then andy another thing that i know

1050
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,240
i see with the

1051
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,880
with our customers is that this also

1052
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,118
kind of helps

1053
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,720
you know from from a high availability

1054
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,720
perspective instead of having a gateway

1055
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,799
you know sitting there idle

1056
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,560
um you know you can use this in the

1057
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,119
sense of as long as you can handle

1058
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,560
you know one member being down and

1059
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,680
handle that you know meet the traffic

1060
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,599
requirements

1061
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,200
this makes uh i know it's definitely a

1062
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,960
rare occasion but it makes the rma

1063
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,480
process a lot easier as well because if

1064
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,040
anything you know happens and you need

1065
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,680
to you know swap gateway members it's

1066
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,359
just you know

1067
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,080
automatically built you know as quick as

1068
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,210
you showed in the demo

1069
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,210
[Music]

1070
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,359
all right so that's the demo absolutely

1071
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,440
nick

1072
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:50,799
um that's a that's perfect

1073
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,359
uh lead in i mean that

1074
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,800
that whole h8 that always bothered me i

1075
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,000
had a box sitting there that's why i

1076
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,160
turned up load shearing when

1077
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,359
i could but load shearing is also not

1078
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,960
good if you uh

1079
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:02,720
actually lose one of those load sharing

1080
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,319
members and you were going more than

1081
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,319
one unit could actually uh

1082
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,440
process by itself then you're then

1083
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,960
you're oversubscribed on capacity again

1084
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,920
and you can't ever count i'm not losing

1085
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,440
the gateway

1086
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,800
this this ability to do um being able to

1087
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,000
lose a gateway but not

1088
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,119
having a 50 percent uh or 100

1089
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,839
overhead for your gateway counts is

1090
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:30,319
another

1091
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,759
um huge advantage of of the platform so

1092
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,599
it just gives you a better way of

1093
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,000
managing your

1094
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,440
your security spend your investment in a

1095
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,599
multitude of ways again i just want to

1096
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,200
just say you know we kind of did get it

1097
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,000
go into the product a little bit because

1098
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,319
that's what we do

1099
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,839
we see it as a problem and whether other

1100
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,200
vendors come along and do something

1101
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,520
similar we don't know

1102
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,759
we just know that this is a unique way

1103
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,040
to really address a scalability problem

1104
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,040
in the data centers

1105
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,440
again i don't believe all the processing

1106
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,680
and security inspection can

1107
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,480
can or ever will be done all in the

1108
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,399
cloud

1109
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,160
your you know the cloud has to have

1110
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,599
connection points from somewhere whether

1111
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,920
it's a mobile device

1112
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,440
whether it's a endpoint or whether it's

1113
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,119
network connected to the cloud

1114
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,119
there's got to be inspection done

1115
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,119
somewhere to give us that security

1116
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,560
security trust that we need

1117
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,078
you know the internet is untrusted we

1118
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,000
can't say that we trust that

1119
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,720
if we're not going to trust it then we

1120
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,040
have to expect inspect it and get

1121
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,078
a disposition of what we see give

1122
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,400
protection

1123
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,079
or prevention you know prevention is

1124
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,560
something that i think is so overlooked

1125
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,640
and

1126
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,000
and if you're really able to the more

1127
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,040
you're able to inspect

1128
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,200
and detect maliciousness the much

1129
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,480
that much more that you'll be able to

1130
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,759
prevent

1131
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,920
so again um

1132
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,520
whatever your whatever you do find

1133
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,280
solutions that can give you them full

1134
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,720
inspection don't take shortcuts and not

1135
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,200
do ssl

1136
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,839
or other things because it's too hard or

1137
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,919
it's too

1138
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,680
uh resource intensive there are

1139
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,359
solutions to help you scale

1140
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,839
in a way that you can get the inspection

1141
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,839
that you need

1142
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,960
all right do we have any uh any

1143
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,240
questions

1144
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,200
hopefully we have answers now for a

1145
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,919
configuration consistency is is maestro

1146
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,240
able to manage um devices in multiple

1147
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,760
locations

1148
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:30,479
so we do have a redundant um

1149
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,520
redundancy solution and this is

1150
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,280
something that wasn't an

1151
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,520
initial product but it is now as long as

1152
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,319
you have well good connectivity

1153
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,599
you can put security groups you can use

1154
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,520
gateways

1155
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,839
in disparate locations

1156
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,400
in the same security group so that means

1157
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,560
yes absolutely you can do that

1158
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,400
most the time it's somebody's large data

1159
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,440
center their production and their dr

1160
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,240
environment

1161
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,680
that they have a redundancy land

1162
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,919
redundancy and

1163
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,279
bgp and they'll be able to fail over to

1164
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,920
the second data center

1165
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,720
and that's how it's done but we've got i

1166
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,480
had a slide

1167
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,160
what didn't make it here but basically

1168
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,359
showed you a security group that went

1169
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,319
across site or one that ran in and then

1170
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,440
ones that ran

1171
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,200
individually on the two different data

1172
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,560
centers so

1173
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,000
yes but i would say that you would

1174
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,359
probably do that in

1175
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,640
you know maybe one one two sites at most

1176
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,240
i would think

1177
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,680
um that's typically what it is and it's

1178
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,279
for those larger things if you're

1179
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,118
thinking of branch office there's other

1180
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,359
ways of doing those kind of

1181
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,240
uh inspections whether it's inspection

1182
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,839
in the cloud or

1183
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,839
on-premise gateway

1184
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,520
and do you typically only inspect your

1185
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,160
own company's traffic

1186
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,800
or if you're collaborating with another

1187
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,118
company

1188
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,240
and they're accessing the cloud does

1189
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,560
their traffic go

1190
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,000
through your device before going to the

1191
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,440
cloud

1192
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,200
only if they're connected through your

1193
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,319
network um

1194
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,359
obviously this is an on-prem solution so

1195
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,359
wherever

1196
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:07,598
that inspection point is so it would

1197
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,440
depend on the topology of your network

1198
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,839
some bring partners in like that and

1199
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,960
then feed them back up to the internet

1200
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,400
um there's uh like in the hospital case

1201
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,160
there's times whenever they do

1202
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,560
partnerships with other hospitals and

1203
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,399
the

1204
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,640
the big comp the big hospital would have

1205
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,319
say in what the little hospital does and

1206
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,359
says we're going to inspect all your

1207
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:30,720
traffic

1208
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,160
so but this is the inspection isn't done

1209
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,480
in the cloud even though it works like

1210
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,720
the cloud and it's technologies that are

1211
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,119
that we're basically born in the cloud

1212
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,200
this whole auto scaling idea

1213
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,640
it really is still on premise so it

1214
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,640
would depend on the topology

1215
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,839
good questions though

1216
00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:05,839
and again everyone can take themselves

1217
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:05,839
off me to ask a question

1218
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:13,680
um along the lines of sight redundancy

1219
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,799
there's also a lot of people say okay

1220
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,960
that's great

1221
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,720
you're gonna give me a you're gonna give

1222
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,720
me this switch

1223
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,240
basically to distribute this traffic to

1224
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,439
the gateways and the gateway can fail

1225
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,839
and you have enough capacity

1226
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,280
what about the switch well that's one

1227
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,759
where you have the choice

1228
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,599
you can run a single switch or yet and

1229
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,520
this is to a

1230
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,680
consider it as a single site you can run

1231
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,079
one switch but then

1232
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,040
you got a single point of failure but

1233
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,119
the switches

1234
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,520
are you know not aren't really as costly

1235
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,760
as the gateways

1236
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,560
depending on the gateway models but the

1237
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,560
switch

1238
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:52,960
essentially can have redundancy

1239
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,720
um if that's a concern of the single

1240
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:00,800
point of failure in which most there are

1241
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:02,160
most people most customers buy too

1242
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,000
yeah i was going to actually add that to

1243
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,240
the first question andy is that you know

1244
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,079
the switch redundancy can be done over

1245
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,040
you know multiple sites as well so you

1246
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,440
can have a

1247
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,800
you know second second stack of you know

1248
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,880
entire solution at a

1249
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,880
you know secondary data center

1250
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,280
hey guys this is uh chris i just want to

1251
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,680
make one comment i know

1252
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,560
nick and andy have both mentioned this

1253
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,759
but

1254
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,200
you know from what we've seen people at

1255
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,800
different levels within

1256
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,879
an organization have a different

1257
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,000
appreciation for

1258
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,319
for the solution um people are who are

1259
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,720
more hands-on

1260
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,319
appreciate the technology and how you

1261
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,118
know innovative it is and how it can

1262
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,119
allow them to

1263
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,200
be more effective and more efficient

1264
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,960
what they do as you move

1265
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:58,000
up um people are more appreciative

1266
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,440
of the financial impact

1267
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,280
and again this is the part that was

1268
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,040
emphasized a couple times but i i

1269
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,319
want to emphasize it again just because

1270
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,200
we've seen it

1271
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,160
play out where you know instead of

1272
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,598
buying

1273
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,520
capacity that you think you're going to

1274
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,640
need in three to five years

1275
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:17,520
you buy the capacity you need now

1276
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,920
if you grow quicker than you thought you

1277
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,240
were going to grow

1278
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,040
you just buy the additional smaller

1279
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,680
gateways

1280
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,119
sooner if for whatever reason you don't

1281
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,160
grow as fast as you thought you were

1282
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,400
going to grow

1283
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,200
you just don't buy those gateways as

1284
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,280
quickly

1285
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,118
so it allows you to be a better steward

1286
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,119
of your companies and financial

1287
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,599
resources rather than spending a lot of

1288
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,720
money

1289
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,720
upfront on something that you know

1290
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,760
may even be you know obsolete sooner

1291
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,440
than you thought because of rapid growth

1292
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,839
in the company

1293
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,240
or spending a lot of money and not ever

1294
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:58,480
actually hitting the

1295
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,000
the capacity you know in three to five

1296
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,000
years because

1297
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,440
covet and you didn't grow as quickly as

1298
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,480
you were going to grow

1299
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,119
you know the for people who are very

1300
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,040
budget-minded this is also a very good

1301
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,960
solution in addition to

1302
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,759
people who are more just concerned with

1303
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,760
the technology

1304
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,920
leave it to the sales guy to to bring in

1305
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:23,280
the financial inspect

1306
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,280
impacts to keep us honest

1307
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,920
right chris and at the end of the day

1308
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,680
something can do you know everything in

1309
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,559
the world but if you can't afford to pay

1310
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,799
for it

1311
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,599
it's not going to benefit that company

1312
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,599
yeah that's right

1313
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,480
landy and nick thank you for your

1314
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:48,240
presentation today and for your support

1315
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,400
of b-sides greenville

1316
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:58,399
thanks mike thank you thank you

1317
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:58,400
appreciate it
