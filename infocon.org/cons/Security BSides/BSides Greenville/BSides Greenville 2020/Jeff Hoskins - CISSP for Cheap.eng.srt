1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,600
hey welcome everybody I am Jeff Hoskins

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,080
and yeah that's the title is how to get

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,699
your CISSP for cheap this came from all

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,880
the things i wish that somebody would

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:22,948
have told me whenever i was thinking

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:25,079
about this certification and yeah i went

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,119
to people and said hey you've got this

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,960
I'm thinking about it and I got one of

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,380
two responses

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,090
I was um yeah I got it 10 years ago I

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,879
have no idea I never want to do that

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,350
again and I don't really remember what

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,850
was on it but I have some books and I'll

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,370
send you the books then they didn't send

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,820
me the books or I got just go to boot

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,290
camp

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,250
and then I looked up boot camp and it

18
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,600
was lots of money so um I decided to go

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,770
about it a different way save a little

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,850
money see if I could do it without

21
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,170
spending all that money and I did and I

22
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,280
want to tell people what these sources

23
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,470
are so here we go

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,290
we'll go through the what is the CISSP

25
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:07,110
I guess we need to break down that those

26
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,720
five letters why do it how to do it and

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,150
how to do it cheap the goals are to save

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,300
money save time and to be confident when

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,909
you walk in to do your test

30
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:21,030
oh yeah and I've got a disclaimer on

31
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,700
there that um you know I'm not really my

32
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,400
feedback doesn't my opinions don't or

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,190
not for any other companies or anything

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,409
so who is this presentation for if you

35
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,720
are thinking about taking the CISSP if

36
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,850
you are concerned about passing it are

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,908
you concerned about funding

38
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,798
are you considering using the CISSP to

39
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,770
develop others and you don't really want

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,799
to pay $10,000 to fund their education

41
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,048
but you want to help them get it

42
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:50,490
especially because they could just get

43
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,420
it and leave your company and you've

44
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,929
developed them so what now where do I

45
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,630
start

46
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,500
so what is it here is the is c-squared

47
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,820
explanation of what a certified

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,000
information systems security

49
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,299
professional is that's a lot of bla bla

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,849
bla basically this shows your experience

51
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:15,360
in your exposure it could just be a

52
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:17,010
check box for applying it is considered

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,240
the gold standard for information

54
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,060
security certificate

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,400
and our certifications you are a

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,020
security adviser when you get this

57
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,670
you're not deeply technical in anything

58
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,680
and it doesn't indicate basic that you

59
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,420
really have an expertise it just says

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,180
you've put some time and you've tried to

61
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,750
really go around and learn this from a

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,820
well rounded point of view there's a lot

63
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,830
of misconceptions about how deep you

64
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,010
need to go and it's really it's it's not

65
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:51,710
very deep it's more about connecting

66
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,850
ideas so why would you get the CISSP

67
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,880
you may want to do it for self growth

68
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,530
self growth you may have a position

69
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,810
requirement you're trying to get a

70
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,010
position and it's a requirement or maybe

71
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,320
you've been told you need to grow in

72
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,899
that to keep your position or to keep

73
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,700
you know getting good evaluations you

74
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,860
may have heard about a skills gap in the

75
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,589
industry and that these are needed or

76
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,640
people and you want to shine above other

77
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,610
people whenever you're going after

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,679
opportunities one thing I put in this

79
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,900
presentation months ago when I first

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
started drawing it up unless you might

81
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,110
want to get the CISSP for your

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,870
confidence I actually don't believe that

83
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,100
anymore I believe that um you should you

84
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,230
need to find your confidence within

85
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,570
yourself and even do things where you're

86
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,310
not confident go up in if you think the

87
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,890
CISSP is gonna help you go talk in front

88
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,990
of people or go talk to people in a if

89
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,450
we ever get to network in person again

90
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,650
and you see a group of people and this

91
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,570
certification is not going to make you

92
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,920
better at interacting with them go

93
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:51,660
interact with them and you know people

94
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,040
aren't that evil you're gonna have a

95
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,630
good conversation so you'll learn

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,579
something maybe they'll learn something

97
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,609
maybe you'll realize that there's

98
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,520
they're not they're not the wizards

99
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:06,420
which goes into the next slide

100
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,130
how do you get the certificate you need

101
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,890
five years of experience in two or more

102
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,299
domains and if you don't have the

103
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,029
experience there's some other stuff you

104
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,829
can do but these are the eight domains

105
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,470
just to give you a little bit of my

106
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,710
history Atlas more I've been more in the

107
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,690
security and risk management I do a

108
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,950
little bit of everything but security

109
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,200
risk management and then I didn't the

110
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,529
access management are my two big ones

111
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,929
and yeah

112
00:04:31,529 --> 00:04:35,639
got some some of the other ones but not

113
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:38,779
as deep that number one and number five

114
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,009
or my deepest just from my experience

115
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:43,699
you need some book knowledge

116
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,809
like I said broad but not deep and

117
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:49,019
forget the idea that you have to be a

118
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:51,659
wizard or a magician or some you know

119
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,069
savant you you don't need any of that so

120
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,319
I just want people to know that you can

121
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:56,909
just build the blocks up get this

122
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:01,799
knowledge under your belt go take the

123
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:04,188
test and you'll be good so what does the

124
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:08,128
certificate cost or what does the

125
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:10,589
certification cost you can you might be

126
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:13,469
in buying books you could spend hundreds

127
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:15,149
of dollars on various books boot camps

128
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:17,189
that was one of the big things people

129
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:19,969
told me to go do they told me the

130
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:22,289
company might pay for it I had some I'm

131
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:24,498
maybe maybe if you want to go and you

132
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:26,308
consider hey I got to go away for a week

133
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:28,169
but if you have to pay for yourself

134
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:31,049
that's the boot camp the travel the

135
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:33,779
lodging the food you're missing work so

136
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:39,058
all of that I just didn't want to go

137
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:40,709
after that in that way also boot camp

138
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:42,569
puts a lot of pressure on you and your a

139
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:46,949
lot of them let you take the test on the

140
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:48,029
last day if I'm not ready then I don't

141
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,889
want to be pressured into taking the

142
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:51,389
test so I decided to try to get ready

143
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:55,349
without boot camp if I have failed

144
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:57,089
miserably May got a look at it you have

145
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,589
to pay for the test itself you're gonna

146
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,479
have the hassle of all of this

147
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:02,519
coordination and any of the that's an

148
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,699
overall cost time away from family as

149
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:08,489
you prepare and then you've got fees to

150
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,959
is C squared and you know of course

151
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:13,229
you've got fees there's no way I'm gonna

152
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,879
tell you how to get around those the

153
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:16,739
path that most people told me to do with

154
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:21,089
the boot camp in the books was probably

155
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:22,198
gonna cost me around $7,000 and I did

156
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,669
all this and I'm gonna tell you how I

157
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,799
did it for about nine hundred dollars

158
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:27,359
and eight hundred twenty-five dollars of

159
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:35,039
that was going to is C squared so that

160
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:37,109
was unavoidable okay so how do you get

161
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,239
the certification what are the steps

162
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:42,808
first you have to confirm you have the

163
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:44,638
required experience just for yourself

164
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:44,969
and then you go go register they're

165
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,099
going to

166
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:49,289
back after everything and make you show

167
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,909
and prove you have the experience but

168
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,989
just for yourself count up how are you

169
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:55,438
going to get to your five years of

170
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:58,679
experience and you know there's eight

171
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,569
domains so if you were doing networking

172
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:04,498
that's one of the domains if you were

173
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:07,259
doing security assessments that's a

174
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:08,759
domain so you can a lot of stuff count

175
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,659
so don't count yourself out until you

176
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:15,839
actually go and look into the

177
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:17,099
requirements then you register for the

178
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,289
test that is going to cost you six

179
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:24,029
hundred ninety nine dollars I typed this

180
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:25,919
up back in like November December so I

181
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:28,829
don't think it's going up but it might

182
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,558
have and actually just to tell you all I

183
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:33,929
took the test in like November first so

184
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:37,019
and I passed or I wouldn't be given this

185
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:40,229
presentation so yet to pass the test

186
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:43,019
then you contact a sponsor somebody else

187
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,239
who has the certification that knows you

188
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:47,099
and knows that you've actually put time

189
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:49,529
into this or they can vouch for your

190
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:51,959
experience and you get them to sponsor

191
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,969
you so as you pass the test you will get

192
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,949
an email that says hey you made it you

193
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:58,469
passed the test now you need to give us

194
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:00,419
tell us who's going to sponsor you you

195
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:03,058
contact that sponsor they will give you

196
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,489
their sponsor information and then you

197
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:09,300
put that into the tool on the is

198
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:11,128
c-squared webpage and submit that you

199
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,779
allow them Tom this this is like the

200
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:15,179
longest six weeks ever even though I

201
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,979
knew I had a passing score I was you

202
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:20,998
know well we'll get those scoring in a

203
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:22,619
few minutes you finally received accept

204
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:27,749
its notification and then you pay

205
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:29,669
another $125 and as soon as you pay that

206
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:31,529
they say wow you're certified you're

207
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:33,179
always in this from the time you pass

208
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:35,849
the test until the time you pay that fee

209
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,318
you're in this pending phase but as soon

210
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,039
as you pay you're magically certified at

211
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:42,808
that point and then for the rest of your

212
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,889
life until you retire or you decide you

213
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:45,990
don't want to do this security thing

214
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:48,290
anymore you pay that annual fee because

215
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,759
you never want to take this test again

216
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,709
you also collect CPEs

217
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,990
those are going to be a requirement but

218
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:57,359
all certifications seem to have that and

219
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,630
you'll get some today and then you can

220
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,690
help advance the profession

221
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,939
helped others just be a good steward of

222
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:08,220
this certification and helping this be a

223
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,220
good career path for many other people

224
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,510
all right what are the experience

225
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,940
requirements like I said five years in

226
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,010
two of the domains I've told you I was

227
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,280
in domain one and domain five for the

228
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:24,280
majority of my experience if you don't

229
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,660
have that you can you can get one year

230
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,439
of experience by showing that you have a

231
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:31,480
four-year degree in a relevant for a

232
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,300
relevant for your degree or that you

233
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,520
have another security credential you can

234
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,849
look up the exact requirements on the

235
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,350
CISSP website I did put the URL there

236
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:45,370
you're going to need to become familiar

237
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:47,320
with that site to go forward anyway you

238
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,000
can pass the exam without any experience

239
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,760
and get an associate level credential

240
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,990
and I didn't really have to look too

241
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,569
deep into that cuz I had the experience

242
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,920
but you can do that if you just want to

243
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,910
get ahead and have it and then it'll

244
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,890
turn over when you prove the experience

245
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:07,060
okay so what is the test how does the

246
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,830
test work this is something that made me

247
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,319
pretty nervous to think about so first

248
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,760
of all you're paying your $700 I can't

249
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,670
help you get around that that's your

250
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,800
biggest fee so the way the test is these

251
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,740
days and this is not the test that

252
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,229
people 10 years ago had but you get on

253
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,420
you get three hours you will get a

254
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:29,320
minimum of 100 questions and a maximum

255
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,900
of 150 questions and the tool is dynamic

256
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,150
so if you are showing that you are not

257
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,439
showing expertise on some questions it's

258
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,790
going to give you more questions in that

259
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,910
area to give you a chance to show

260
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,349
expertise if you do answer well and show

261
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,920
your expertise it'll move on to another

262
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:47,700
subject so that tells you it's going to

263
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,130
be dynamically changing as you answer

264
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,810
out of the first 100 questions 25 of

265
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,370
them are going to be test questions that

266
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,040
don't even count against you they're

267
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,020
just seeing if they work if they look

268
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,240
like they're good indicators of somebody

269
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:07,619
having mastered this knowledge

270
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,869
at question 100 the test might stop at

271
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:12,480
question 110 the test might stop at

272
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:14,429
question 150 the test might stop so

273
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,589
you'll get to a point in the test where

274
00:11:14,429 --> 00:11:20,850
it has made a decision the tool has said

275
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:23,429
with you know 95% clarity or you know

276
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,649
whatever their algorithms are they don't

277
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:28,980
release the exact numbers but it has

278
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:31,829
said I statistically know that you're

279
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,059
good or I statistically know that you're

280
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:35,489
not good

281
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,410
so at 100 questions it could stop and

282
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,689
fail you it could stop and pass you or

283
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:43,769
at 150 it could stop it or anywhere in

284
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:46,980
between one thing that that leads people

285
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:51,300
to doing is if you go out into the

286
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,639
reddit forums the are the subs or

287
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,139
whatever they're called or anywhere

288
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,920
you'll you'll see people just posting

289
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:01,980
past him 100 100 questions in 65 minutes

290
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,529
passed at 120 questions didn't pass at

291
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:08,129
150 don't get tied up in reading all

292
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:10,230
that you everybody gets the same you

293
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:11,970
passed or you fail you you don't need to

294
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,839
know if somebody passed it 100 and think

295
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,449
that that means they're more valuable

296
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,839
than somebody had passed at 110 who

297
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:19,498
cares

298
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,999
so don't perpetuate that how many

299
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:22,769
minutes you took well you had three

300
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:24,569
hours you know if you took it in 65

301
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:25,619
minutes okay somebody else took it in 90

302
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:26,849
minutes they'd like to read more

303
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:31,110
somebody might have been sick that day

304
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,730
who cares about the minutes so that's

305
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,980
why I'm not sharing with you I mean I

306
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,139
solidly passed but I'm not gonna say I

307
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,730
did it in X and X it's just it doesn't

308
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:44,970
help anybody so um I talked about the

309
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:48,660
adaptive format and when the test ends

310
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:51,029
so if you don't like that if you want

311
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,889
the six-hour test you want it to be 250

312
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:54,839
questions you can look at the

313
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:57,990
non-english offerings because they are

314
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,220
still offered that way and that's where

315
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,369
I would hope that the room would giggle

316
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,809
but you know okay so I took it with that

317
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:05,939
test okay

318
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:07,980
the electronic test was not available

319
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:10,559
when I took it and I will tell you guys

320
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,879
it was painful you know what I mean cuz

321
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,669
you're sitting there that long and it's

322
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:17,040
and it's the old school you know style I

323
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,480
mean when I took it bubble boxes like

324
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,730
you took you know and again I don't know

325
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,589
how old everybody is so that's when I

326
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,570
was growing up and he took the SAT and

327
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:27,990
every other test it was all bubble boxes

328
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,820
you know what I mean everything was you

329
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:34,290
name it everything was bubble boxes and

330
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,850
and yeah it was a long test yeah so now

331
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,920
the worst thing about the test for me

332
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,079
was there you don't over all we need

333
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,029
yeah when I was gonna say when you take

334
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,560
that test and the old one you do not

335
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,720
find out immediately I don't know if

336
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,279
they do now but in the old days you know

337
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,380
what I mean you found out weeks later

338
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,959
where at least where the electronic test

339
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,870
you know at the end of the test failed

340
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:57,119
back then you did not so there is there

341
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,509
is a delay there and I will talk about

342
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,339
that you hit a certain number of

343
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:04,560
questions in the tool says okay I'm good

344
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,120
and then you have to raise your hand

345
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,709
you're in that you know the proctor room

346
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,360
and they walk over and that you know

347
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:11,339
you're a strain of copán and you showed

348
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,230
them the screen it says hey I'm done and

349
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,120
they say okay thank you and they they do

350
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,579
their checks on the system to make sure

351
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:22,440
that you're not you know being nefarious

352
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:23,910
there and then you walk out and you're

353
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,930
stand there and then they they check you

354
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,699
out and you have to sign something

355
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,949
saying you didn't you have to do a palm

356
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:31,019
scan and there's like this delay and

357
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:32,609
then a printer across the room prints

358
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,260
out a sheet of paper and you know what's

359
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,459
on it but you're not allowed to run over

360
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,310
there yet because they're still doing

361
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:40,589
their due diligence of making sure you

362
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,779
haven't done anything bad so during that

363
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,279
delay period you're like what what

364
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,069
what's going on what's going on what's

365
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:48,750
going on but eventually you get the

366
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:50,849
sheet of paper I see somebody's asking

367
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,160
on discord about how proctoring is

368
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,839
working during kovat I've seen a lot of

369
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,180
people talking about that on different

370
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,089
forums of how various tests are being

371
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,399
proctored now I don't know what cissp is

372
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,800
doing right now I know that some people

373
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,569
just couldn't take a test for a while

374
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,939
and then the test dates were hard to

375
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:10,709
come by so if you're looking for it go

376
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:13,410
into the site try to schedule a test and

377
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:15,750
see what it offers you it may be

378
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,730
offering something that is months away

379
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,529
or some people said that wow it opened

380
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,569
up something tomorrow I think I'm gonna

381
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,980
go take it tomorrow and like that may

382
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:29,459
not be the best choice but if you feel

383
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:29,690
you're ready it might be so just to tell

384
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,969
you

385
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,230
what what I did as I was going through

386
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,590
this and what I wish people would have

387
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:39,440
shared with me he has I developed a next

388
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,850
generation solution I used some

389
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,850
artificial intelligence some deep

390
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:46,160
learning a little bit of blockchain I

391
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,610
put it all in one pane of glass and

392
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,069
that's what I have for you today no I'm

393
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,450
not just kidding but I wanted to cover

394
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:58,790
all the buzzwords that you're supposed

395
00:15:53,450 --> 00:16:00,350
to say at a conference so here's how you

396
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,089
prepare for the test first of all you

397
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,020
have to know the code and that is to

398
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:06,530
code of ethics

399
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,780
don't steal training materials you know

400
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,699
we're all in this industry where we know

401
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:14,540
how to get two things or we can find

402
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:17,510
ways to share things and don't do that

403
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,530
there's there's plenty of cheap sources

404
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,970
there's plenty of people putting out

405
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,760
free sources I'm going to tell you who

406
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,200
some of those people are and you don't

407
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,150
need to go after something that somebody

408
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:31,280
intended to charge for and unless you're

409
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:38,030
willing to pay for it so now free trials

410
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:40,449
take advantage of free trials so and I'm

411
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:45,140
looking at the discord

412
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:46,730
it looks like proctoring stuff okay so

413
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,310
the code of ethics you'll need to know

414
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,440
this in order the the canons you see

415
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:55,069
there there's four of them protect

416
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,140
society act honorably provide competent

417
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,300
service to your principles and advance

418
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,740
the profession those are in order so if

419
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,589
you were to come across a question that

420
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,930
asks you you know do you do this or do

421
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,910
you do that and you know all this looks

422
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,459
like an ethics question then you have to

423
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,310
remember what order because you might be

424
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:15,260
required to protect society before you

425
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:19,429
are providing competent service to your

426
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:23,510
principles at least for the test now if

427
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:25,250
you're you know military or law

428
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,990
enforcement you might have other rules

429
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,470
but for this test you've got to go with

430
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,840
these canons in this order those are

431
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:38,150
also available at the is c-squared

432
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:40,520
website so here's the sources that I

433
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,950
used to get a well ran up test

434
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,550
preparation and the idea is I don't want

435
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,700
you going all

436
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:49,850
and thinking you need to buy everything

437
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,530
a lot of people will tell you go buy all

438
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,469
these books go to all these boot camps

439
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:57,010
and you could spend all over your time

440
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:59,450
you could spend all of your money and

441
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,710
are you really effectively using your

442
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,320
time and money so I'm gonna tell you

443
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:06,380
some videos some books some test

444
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,360
simulators and then after you do that

445
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,160
you'll need to learn how to you'll learn

446
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,469
your weak spots so you need to learn how

447
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,780
to go after those weak spots and then

448
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:17,570
the immersion part that's that's putting

449
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,639
it all together I believe that's one of

450
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,889
the most important parts about this test

451
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,540
is that it doesn't ask you things all

452
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,030
from one domain at the same time

453
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,740
it'll ask you a question that actually

454
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:31,510
interacts with four different domains

455
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:33,740
and lets you make a risk decision so

456
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:37,370
that's where the immersion comes in as

457
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,510
is making a risk decision and then time

458
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:41,629
wasters I'm going to tell you some

459
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:43,580
places where I wasted time I thought

460
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,780
they were gonna be good sources they

461
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,850
seemed like they were gonna be good

462
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,139
sources and now that I've taken the test

463
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:53,419
I realized that they were leading me

464
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:58,600
astray so three free video series and

465
00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:01,790
these were free back in February March

466
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,679
but they still might so we'll just go

467
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:07,340
through the list sigh Prairie Kelley

468
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,260
Hanrahan's series this is multiple hours

469
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,290
of her explaining everything you need to

470
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:14,360
know for the test this is a great series

471
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:17,720
you need to sign up for a cyber e free

472
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,879
account but about a month ago I heard

473
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,660
they pulled her videos off of the free

474
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,570
site are off of the free offerings but

475
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,160
cyber area is always shifting stuff

476
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,530
around so she might come back onto the

477
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,710
free she might have fallen off the free

478
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:36,710
because my account got to be six months

479
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,850
old a year old so she wasn't free to me

480
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,270
anymore

481
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,949
look for her videos also on cyber re

482
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,240
there's always once you sign up for a

483
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,920
free account you can look up in the

484
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,010
corner of the page and they're always

485
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:51,050
saying hey sell ins today everything's

486
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:56,000
50% off sale ends tomorrow everything

487
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:57,409
70% off there's always an unaware e so

488
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,300
if you need to get a month and

489
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:05,200
just see her videos that's worth it the

490
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:08,000
next set of videos is fr secure and

491
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,980
those are always free that is a I

492
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,200
believe they're in Minnesota it's a

493
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,620
security firm and they're just offering

494
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,480
a CISSP Mentor Program you go up onto

495
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,610
their page I believe it's under the

496
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,860
events tab they've done it for several

497
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,649
years they're like a thousand people

498
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,689
taking it this year you're a little late

499
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:29,210
to sign up to take it synchronously with

500
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:31,790
them they're there wrapping up their

501
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,590
program right now but they post

502
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,600
everything to YouTube so I didn't take

503
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:40,429
it synchronously when I did it I used

504
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:42,409
their 2019 videos and they were on

505
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:44,240
YouTube and I watched all of their

506
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,710
videos and those helped me so that was

507
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,770
my second exposure to all of the

508
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:53,030
material then later on I found out about

509
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:55,190
CBT Nuggets they had a one-week trial

510
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,620
where you get to listen to the guy it's

511
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:02,480
a guy's training site I mean he probably

512
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:05,479
speaks it besides as well you go in his

513
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,790
sight he all for seven days and it's a

514
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,970
free trial he chose to put on a free

515
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:13,790
trial I used about five days got through

516
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,620
those videos and I'll say you know maybe

517
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:18,470
I'll go back one day and actually need

518
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:21,379
something and get a paid site we get a

519
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:23,720
paid membership to his site so I am

520
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:27,530
gonna say that I did use his seven day

521
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:29,210
free trial there so those are videos

522
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,680
that is you can speed them up you can go

523
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,010
to one point two five one point five

524
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,750
speed but they are gonna expose you and

525
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,210
that's multiple people so you get

526
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,950
different exposures and even on the fr

527
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:44,990
secure it's gonna be a different flavor

528
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:49,490
in 2018 2019 2020 videos so you can get

529
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:51,020
a lot of free content there and not and

530
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,610
that's basically the boot camps that's

531
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:59,670
what I envision a boot camp would have

532
00:21:52,610 --> 00:22:01,800
given me so next books I did

533
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:04,080
go buy some books these are the two sets

534
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:08,070
of books I bought I just went on Amazon

535
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:11,970
spend about $50 on the sea is the

536
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:15,120
official cissp book from is C squared

537
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:18,900
and the practice test so that came in a

538
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,090
big stack of two books and then later on

539
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,970
about the eleventh hour see Isis people

540
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:25,949
there are other books and there are

541
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:31,580
other good books these are the two I

542
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:33,600
bought the good thing about the CISSP

543
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,810
books from is C squared is they're

544
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,419
considered the official study guide and

545
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:41,550
they have practice tests in them so

546
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:44,700
that's that's great and they even have

547
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:46,200
an online test simulator the bad thing

548
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,060
about that is a lot of people say they

549
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,880
they read those books front to back

550
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:54,270
cover to cover multiple times I couldn't

551
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,840
do that it's awful sorry I just can't

552
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:59,670
sit there and read those I would read

553
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,780
the intro to each chapter or each domain

554
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:05,610
and look at the tests and then for weak

555
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,649
spot concentration I'd go back into the

556
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:12,899
book and find exactly what I wanted to

557
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:14,850
look for then the next book I got was

558
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,160
the eleventh hour that one that one's

559
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,659
short I could actually read it and I did

560
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:26,240
read it cover to cover and I did it

561
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:28,500
later in my study process so then next

562
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,710
okay here's the test simulator this

563
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,740
comes with the book there's instructions

564
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,360
inside the book that tell you and then

565
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,980
you go to there it says go to this

566
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,429
website and then you go to the Wiley

567
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:44,640
website and it says look at page you

568
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,440
know 47 third paragraph of the book and

569
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,150
you just you're proving you have the

570
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,530
book that's what they wanted so that

571
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:52,430
they could give you a 12-month account

572
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:55,170
at Wally so you prove you have a book

573
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:58,020
and then you get to get their test

574
00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:00,570
simulator their test simulator was good

575
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:03,810
it was the only one I used and you can

576
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,879
see here it has the chapters so you can

577
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:10,409
do a practice test based on each chapter

578
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,450
you can do a full exam and it'll it'll

579
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,200
time you and it you know you can tell it

580
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,330
don't give me the

581
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,200
until I'm done and that's whether you do

582
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:20,070
it in practice mode or an exam mode

583
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,320
somebody's asking about the all-in-one

584
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:26,129
books I don't know I didn't use those

585
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,418
books um and that was one of my things

586
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,639
is I didn't want to go out and buy

587
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:31,500
everything so I'm what I'm trying to

588
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:33,539
tell you here is if you do these things

589
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,100
you will get adequate exposure and you

590
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:39,269
don't have to worry should I have done

591
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:41,039
that should I have done this this will

592
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:46,590
be adequate exposure to if you do these

593
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:49,080
things so the kana had about this the

594
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,939
Wiley Cybex test simulator is the

595
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,689
explanations of the right answer are

596
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,529
just not enough and here's an example

597
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:59,940
this is not a real test question but

598
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:02,880
let's let's we're just going to go

599
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,470
through this so let's assume they give

600
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,120
you a question of your company has sent

601
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,360
you overseas to conduct a security

602
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:12,360
assessment on a vendor that processes

603
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,979
phi4 your company and and they won't

604
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,610
write out pH I don't expect you to know

605
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,970
what that is

606
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:21,240
so you look at this setup and you say

607
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,970
okay my company so I'm employed I've

608
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,470
been sent overseas okay so there's some

609
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,149
country and boundary things but I don't

610
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,549
know where I got sent so I can't say

611
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:32,489
this is European Union stuff or if this

612
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:33,600
is I can't say it's got California

613
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,830
privacy in it

614
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,260
I don't know much there but I went

615
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,939
overseas okay I'm conducting a security

616
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,220
assessment that's why I'm there I'm

617
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,500
looking at a vendor okay so now I've got

618
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,260
the interrelationships third parties

619
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,059
here so and I'm looking at pH a so

620
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:52,230
there's a there's a health flavor here

621
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:53,730
okay so this lead-in has told me you

622
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,620
know eight or nine things I already know

623
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,169
I need to be thinking about different

624
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,268
risks and variables are starting to

625
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:01,590
float in my head and then the question

626
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:03,590
comes up what is the first thing you

627
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:09,389
should do upon arrival to the hotel and

628
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:13,500
if y'all post in discord and see what

629
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:16,799
you think the answer is here and I wrote

630
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:21,539
this question way before the the coded

631
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:23,190
thing but you should you immediately

632
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,990
begin to hack the vendor since your IP

633
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,059
address will be local should you wash

634
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:29,549
your hands should you take a nap

635
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:33,269
or should you text your next of kin to

636
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:38,220
advised of safe arrival so I'm seeing

637
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:41,100
some people say I say B D C B and

638
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,409
definitely B now and B okay

639
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,230
like I said I wrote this before Kovac

640
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:48,149
and this is the idea of this is to show

641
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,980
you the type of explanations that the

642
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:53,248
wildly Cybex text test generator is

643
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,720
going to give you um the answer the

644
00:26:53,249 --> 00:26:57,740
first thing you should do upon arrival

645
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,539
to the hotel is wash your hands now

646
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,999
yeah that happened I left it there with

647
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:04,740
the kovat thing going around but to me I

648
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:07,529
don't see that as being an explanation

649
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,080
so I want to know well why did they

650
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:13,019
think that because yeah I can look at a

651
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,178
and think yeah I'm not supposed to just

652
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:16,830
go hack the bender that that's something

653
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,470
I need rules of engagement and nobody

654
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,480
has told me I had that and that's not

655
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,889
all a security assessment is so I can I

656
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,659
can pretty much write that one else it's

657
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:29,008
probably illegal I could wash my hands I

658
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:31,259
could take a nap I could text somebody

659
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:35,159
well those are all three I don't know

660
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:36,659
health security relevant they are and so

661
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:39,269
you're kind of looking at these I don't

662
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:40,710
know how to choose among those three you

663
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:43,590
know my wife is gonna tell me to text

664
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,240
her but that's not something the book

665
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,999
told me see some of these questions

666
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,360
she'll be looking at confused as to why

667
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:53,369
and the test generator is not going to

668
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,990
tell you so that is something that's a

669
00:27:53,369 --> 00:28:00,749
little bothersome about that test

670
00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:02,700
generator and like set us a fake

671
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:05,159
question there's no right answer there's

672
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,759
no wrong answer but well I would say

673
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:09,899
hacking them without you know proper

674
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:13,649
authority to do that is probably the

675
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:17,758
wrong answer but nobody said do a so

676
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:19,139
there we go good job the next thing so

677
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,129
that's the reason I'm gonna tell you

678
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:21,330
that there are some other test

679
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:25,469
simulators that you might want to look

680
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:27,029
at but they're gonna cost more so after

681
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,460
you've done the videos after you've done

682
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:31,649
the test simulators then you're going to

683
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,480
find out your weak spots and that's

684
00:28:31,649 --> 00:28:36,779
whenever I think you should go and read

685
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,330
read the book in depth and that's when

686
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:40,830
you pull out YouTube I don't recommend

687
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:44,158
you go into YouTube and just

688
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:46,830
not typing CISSP training you will get

689
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,960
you'll get a lot of results some of it

690
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:53,039
is more stuff to put you asleep some of

691
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,690
it might be good a lot of it was just

692
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,250
wrong after I've taken the test I've

693
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:59,490
realized that a lot of these daily

694
00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,340
questions that people put out or we're

695
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,380
not the kind of stuffs on the test

696
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,149
there's I don't want to particularly

697
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,029
call out any youtubers that are doing

698
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:10,649
this but just just be careful out there

699
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:12,510
because they're not putting out the

700
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:14,489
right material they're asking very

701
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:17,250
technical questions they're asking about

702
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,830
you know this particular server

703
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:23,760
manufacturer and that's that's just not

704
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:29,399
the way the test works so and you mean

705
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:31,529
every type of algorithm or software

706
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:33,120
version is probably going to have a time

707
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:34,529
when it becomes deprecated I mean it's

708
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,510
going to become something that you don't

709
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:37,860
want to use anymore so they don't want

710
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,450
to have questions that are gonna age

711
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,860
like that so a lot of the questions are

712
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,360
not going to you know because they don't

713
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,699
want to have something that's a question

714
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,830
in here that you know last month news

715
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,529
came out and said never do this again

716
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:50,158
but two months ago it was the best thing

717
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:51,899
to do

718
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,240
well then their questions gonna be bad

719
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:56,489
so their questions are trying to be

720
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,279
somewhat timeless so a lot of the

721
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:02,820
questions I saw on the YouTube different

722
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,799
channels were um people who had too much

723
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,260
specificity and their question and it

724
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,480
would have mislead people

725
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:13,440
um yeah somebody's mentioning Sean

726
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:16,110
Harris I didn't use her series but

727
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,519
everybody told me it was great so if

728
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:22,799
that I needed one more thing I would

729
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:24,779
have used that okay so after you've done

730
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,760
you've found your weak spots then you

731
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:30,389
can go out I do recommend YouTube for

732
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,860
you know memorizing some you know I

733
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:33,779
recommend you spend extra time to

734
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,120
memorize some ports look at some

735
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:39,720
encryption algorithm stats maybe you

736
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:42,330
need YouTube to get a few more people to

737
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,250
explain the OSI OSI model to you you

738
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,389
just you just didn't quite get it you

739
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,940
want a refresher you want to hear

740
00:30:45,389 --> 00:30:49,320
somebody else explain it or um you know

741
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,419
what does a router what does a switch

742
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,200
you may realize that I'm from these

743
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:56,510
things to spend extra time on my history

744
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,800
not my experience was not networking so

745
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,290
that was one of the places I had to

746
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,659
build up my knowledge but go to YouTube

747
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:05,409
for those specific questions where you

748
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,410
know you need help

749
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,370
alright the immersion this is where you

750
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,250
get to put things together you get to

751
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:16,879
learn how you know sisters really look

752
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:18,290
at risks and that's one of the things

753
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,800
that's very important to the questions

754
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:27,020
on the test so join the is c-squared

755
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:28,490
chapters aisaka issa go to b-sides see

756
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,730
what people were actually talking about

757
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:33,860
and you know don't exact don't get

758
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,720
sucked into all the the pen testing

759
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,439
that's you know not going to be how to

760
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,760
pin tests that's not what this test is

761
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,070
listen to podcasts some of the ones I

762
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,680
like are unsecured a smashing security

763
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:47,629
and security now sometimes security now

764
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,850
gets you know awful threads that aren't

765
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:53,170
relevant to the test but it's it's good

766
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:56,810
to see how people bring various

767
00:31:53,170 --> 00:32:00,530
different aspects of the test together

768
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:02,860
and make those domains mingle so and

769
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:05,720
then news and blogs are like Krebs

770
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,580
schneier and naked security they give

771
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,920
you articles of current events and

772
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,250
seeing how things are working I believe

773
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,360
this is immersion is the way that you're

774
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:21,680
actually going to now to answer the

775
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:23,870
questions so time wasters going to

776
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,400
reddit for the substance the ISIS be

777
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:29,590
that's where you'll see how fast

778
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:32,210
somebody else failed or passed the test

779
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:34,580
may be in there you might get a few more

780
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:36,110
ideas for some sources to use I think in

781
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,080
this presentation I've given you a lot

782
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:43,639
of ideas of sources to use if you do 90%

783
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,889
of these sources you'll be good you know

784
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,350
read it could also lead you into reading

785
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:51,740
about other people's just troubles and

786
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:55,129
not passing what they studied but a lot

787
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:57,500
of it is just time wasting same thing

788
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:00,620
happened with groups for cissp on

789
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:04,790
facebook there is an app for your phone

790
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:07,040
called pocket prep and that when it

791
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,600
wasn't that it was bad it was just it

792
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,850
took about

793
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,990
it was about ten minutes it just got

794
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:12,520
there all the questions and it had

795
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,530
nothing else for me so if you want to

796
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,580
you know put ten minutes into that but

797
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:19,299
don't think it's gonna be a real good

798
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,649
study aid and then YouTube like I said

799
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:22,299
the general searches could lead you to

800
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:26,140
people who aren't gonna give you great

801
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:29,350
information the next thing that's time

802
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:31,299
wasters is you need to create a parking

803
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,639
lot so all the shining objects that you

804
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:35,379
come across that look really cool while

805
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,650
you're studying you know they're there

806
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,480
is a the book touches on lock-picking so

807
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:43,990
you might need to know that lock-picking

808
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,880
exists well you don't need to go by the

809
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:49,210
practice kit and by the pics and try to

810
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,520
lockpick every lock in your house and

811
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:54,610
every padlock you can find and get

812
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,840
online an order and there's there's a

813
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,209
lot of interesting stuff about lock

814
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,949
picking but it's not gonna help you on

815
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,090
the test to know how to do it what will

816
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,980
help you on the test is just knowing

817
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,220
that lock picking is important to

818
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:09,040
physical security Kali Linux you don't

819
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,710
need to even know what Kali Linux is on

820
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,619
this test so being able to install it

821
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,600
putting in virtual machines running this

822
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,240
going to hack the Box Metasploit able

823
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,270
you don't need to know any of that so

824
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,969
don't put your time in that

825
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:27,280
yeah gary mentions baking into your

826
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:28,449
neighbor's house you know sometimes you

827
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,560
might be want to be a good neighbor and

828
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:31,569
they've locked themselves out and you

829
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,918
save them locksmith bill but that's not

830
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,500
helping you for your test and you know

831
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,850
be careful with that and then I just got

832
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,350
the disco ball for whatever your shiny

833
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,480
object is put it in your parking lot

834
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:41,529
write it down don't forget about it it's

835
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,290
interesting stuff you want to keep

836
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,909
growing but just put that for after the

837
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:48,609
test say you know after I passed this

838
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:51,879
test then I'm gonna and I'm gonna buy a

839
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:53,560
new laptop and put Kali on it or then

840
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:54,639
I'm gonna buy my lockpick set and me my

841
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:00,990
son are gonna learn lock picking

842
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:03,490
together so do that after the test so

843
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:04,930
one thing after I gave this presentation

844
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,240
to some of the people they asked me

845
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:09,029
about a prep plan

846
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,939
how many weeks how much time did I spend

847
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:14,500
so I didn't exactly do it this way but

848
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,510
because I didn't figure out my sources

849
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,730
until later and I did some bad sources

850
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,050
and some good sources but here's the way

851
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,190
I would do it if I was doing it again I

852
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,980
would decide to take the ten

853
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,599
and then schedule it out 12 weeks the

854
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,950
first four weeks I would view all the

855
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:33,369
cyber are E and F are secure videos um

856
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:34,839
and then you know keep up with those do

857
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:37,299
them the right way don't try to speed

858
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:39,759
them away through them do a few hours a

859
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:42,730
night and this is this is planning on 10

860
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:44,619
to 12 hours per week then I would do

861
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:48,130
practice exams for six weeks and this is

862
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:51,700
something I did so the testing later had

863
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:53,500
six weeks of practice tests and I went

864
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,939
off and my daughter was half off at

865
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,369
college I went in her bedroom at the

866
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:00,069
back of the house with my laptop so I

867
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:02,470
could have quiet and I spent three hours

868
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:04,119
there taking a test simulator and then I

869
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:07,058
spent another hour reviewing the results

870
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,710
of you know it says I was weak here well

871
00:36:07,059 --> 00:36:10,690
I would look at every question and try

872
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,579
to see you know the explanations weren't

873
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,680
that great but I would find the weak

874
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:16,119
spots and then during the weeks I would

875
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,529
do that on Saturday morning and then

876
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,069
during that that week I would go to

877
00:36:17,529 --> 00:36:25,569
YouTube Wikipedia the is C squared book

878
00:36:21,069 --> 00:36:28,180
and I would brush up on the things I was

879
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:29,589
having as weak areas something I've

880
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,720
learned since then as there is another

881
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:33,490
site because I feel that I was telling

882
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,589
you to go to cyber re and now it's not

883
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,848
free so I was trying to replace that in

884
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:39,220
the last week or so with another

885
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:41,650
learning O'Reilly com

886
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,269
that's great they have a 10 day trial so

887
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:47,019
at some point you could use that and

888
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:49,000
there they have the books seem to be

889
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:50,799
available you can read the books pretty

890
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,470
well videos are not gonna be available

891
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:55,509
in your trial but the cost wasn't that

892
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:58,720
bad for that if you want to get a month

893
00:36:55,509 --> 00:37:00,849
of that membership so I would do that

894
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,308
for the next six weeks I was always

895
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:08,140
hoping to get up to 90% on the tests but

896
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:12,220
really I stayed in the high 70s I was 77

897
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:15,549
81 88 89 I kind of stayed right there in

898
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:17,680
the right there near 80% I wanted to be

899
00:37:15,549 --> 00:37:19,660
higher but that's where I was coming out

900
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,779
but I'll tell you that that worked out

901
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:26,348
very well on the test so I was not a

902
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:29,769
barely passer so I recommend if you can

903
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:32,170
be around 80% on those that Cybex wylie

904
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:34,600
test generator that's probably that

905
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,450
worked out for me

906
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:40,210
so then I did spend a week and did the

907
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,890
trial version of CBT Nuggets videos

908
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,240
those were good that was you know

909
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,759
another way of just getting another

910
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,919
exposure and then I read the 11th hour

911
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,160
book and then I took the test

912
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,900
so with those you know and also

913
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,149
throughout that time period throw in

914
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,680
listening to your podcasts you know if

915
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,350
you ever have to drive your car again if

916
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,029
we ever you know I used to have a about

917
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,460
an hour commute each way and I could

918
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:06,040
listen to podcast every day now I try to

919
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:09,600
remember to do it but I'm working with

920
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:12,220
home is giving me some other freedoms

921
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,230
you can read the news read the news

922
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:17,350
sites and attend your local inter set

923
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:19,090
groups like b-sides maybe your town has

924
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:21,610
others I'm in about three or four of

925
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:23,980
them in the Columbia area but those also

926
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:28,200
just give you a chance to mix these

927
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,200
ideas and overlap these domains

928
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:39,130
additional sources if you need to you

929
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,900
know you feel this just isn't enough you

930
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:44,860
want some more things get the Sean

931
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:46,360
Harris all-in-one exam guide that's

932
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:50,080
available on Amazon there's lots of used

933
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:52,690
copies do the CBT Nuggets maybe you want

934
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,509
to pay for unlocking the practice tests

935
00:38:52,690 --> 00:39:00,010
in there that's $60 for a month and that

936
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:02,020
way you get their practice tests bosun

937
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,580
they have practice tests to a lot of

938
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,020
people said they have the best practice

939
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:10,060
tests I didn't pay for it

940
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:13,720
I see somebody is asking about cissp

941
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:16,840
versus CISM I did the CISM a few years

942
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,669
before the CISSP the tests are really

943
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,110
quite different but I think they're

944
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:22,240
still looking for the same type of

945
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,100
person that information security manager

946
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,990
versus information security professional

947
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,430
and the titles aren't that different

948
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:30,399
they are offer about two different

949
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:32,980
organizations that was just as I was

950
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,990
coming into this people told me that say

951
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,250
I assume is something you would take

952
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:39,520
first actually they told me security

953
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:43,600
plus first so security plus then C is M

954
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,120
then C is SP and when I went looking at

955
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,560
what the jobs required I used that as AI

956
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,910
these are the jobs I'm kind of wanting

957
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,799
to look at

958
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:53,410
looked at what they required and then

959
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:55,299
chose to do the C Isis in CI SEM first

960
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:58,839
and then a few later few years later

961
00:39:55,299 --> 00:40:01,180
came back and got CISSP don't know how

962
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:05,589
I'm doing on time but um we're almost

963
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:08,950
done anyway then you can also like

964
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:11,229
mention learning O'Reilly oh yeah the

965
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:15,399
tests for CIS MSA Isis we are very

966
00:40:11,229 --> 00:40:17,529
different they're they're not better or

967
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,269
worse but the test questions are very

968
00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:21,700
different

969
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:24,339
CIS em I felt like I was sure I was

970
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,890
right it was kind of a binary sometimes

971
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:29,380
and see Isis B it was like well this is

972
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:31,299
kind of a 60/40 question

973
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:37,119
I hope I'm on the 60 side and not on the

974
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:40,989
40 side so the next one is so I'm gonna

975
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,430
wrap it up I didn't tell you how to pass

976
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:44,259
the test I didn't tell you what the

977
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:47,769
material was on the test you're gonna

978
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:49,509
have to do the work what I am saying is

979
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:50,950
you don't have to pay a bootcamp for you

980
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:52,779
to do the work even if you go to boot

981
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,390
camp you still have to do the work so

982
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:58,479
why pay someone if you're gonna do the

983
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,799
work using the sources I presented you

984
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:01,689
can be confident that you'll be

985
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:06,038
adequately exposed at the proper depth

986
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:07,509
and if you see an odd question on the

987
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:09,190
test if you're taking the test and they

988
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:10,719
throw something at you you've never seen

989
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:14,259
before you don't remember it revealing

990
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:16,599
the book anywhere then you know tell

991
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:18,099
yourself in your head that that was one

992
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,420
of their practice questions that was one

993
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:21,819
that they are reviewing to see if it's

994
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,890
any good and it doesn't matter what I

995
00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:25,420
answered maybe that's true maybe that's

996
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:31,808
not but tell yourself that so you can

997
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:33,819
move ahead then the last thing I have

998
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:37,410
that I'll close with is the

999
00:41:33,819 --> 00:41:39,700
dunning-kruger effect you walk o through

1000
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:41,200
multiple versions of this as you are

1001
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,029
moving from you know you start on the

1002
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,180
left you have no experience and then on

1003
00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:48,009
the right you're very experienced as

1004
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,598
you're getting prepared for this test at

1005
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:51,430
some point you're gonna feel really

1006
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,229
confident you're gonna think I know

1007
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:54,279
everything I'm good well not you don't

1008
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:56,890
know everything but you're gonna think

1009
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:58,450
you're really good at this and then the

1010
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,339
next week you might fall off of that

1011
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:02,348
mount stupid peak and be in the valley

1012
00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:02,670
of despair of thinking you don't know

1013
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:05,610
any

1014
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:07,170
just know that in doing that and going

1015
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,670
from thinking you know a lot to thinking

1016
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:11,670
you don't know a lot you have moved

1017
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,380
forward and overall in what you know so

1018
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,910
I also like to use this when I think

1019
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,260
about my teenagers and they're they're

1020
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:21,270
writing us for life as an adult so um

1021
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,770
but keep that in mind that it's okay

1022
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,120
even if you feel like you're in the

1023
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:29,040
valley of despair you're still moving

1024
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:32,040
forward closer to expert here's all of

1025
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,920
the study materials put on one slide so

1026
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,610
if you weren't taking notes then you

1027
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:41,220
could have them all in one place and

1028
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:43,440
then offer for you all to ask questions

1029
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,939
also in watching the other people giving

1030
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,400
their presentations I noticed a lot of

1031
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,770
people asking for slides so I went and

1032
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,680
just created a github and the only thing

1033
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:53,850
on that github is these slides so that

1034
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,440
way y'all could go out and grab them

1035
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:58,049
today you just go to github and look for

1036
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,350
the repository cheap CISSP and there's

1037
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:03,090
the slots that's all I have on them I'm

1038
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:04,080
gonna look at discord or Shane if you

1039
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,750
want to tell me if any questions have

1040
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,400
come in let me check real quick got it

1041
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,700
and see me a second ago people were

1042
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,620
doing more comments there was go ahead

1043
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:19,350
yeah I see I see a background question

1044
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:22,620
and so my background is management

1045
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:26,250
consulting into project management IT

1046
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:28,140
areas and then those IT areas suddenly

1047
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,030
are not suddenly merged and to always be

1048
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,350
in security area so I was helping

1049
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:35,190
different security areas get their

1050
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:37,620
processes better and then get their

1051
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:40,590
tools new tool installs so doing IT

1052
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:42,569
security project management and realize

1053
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:44,370
I liked working with those teams and be

1054
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:47,670
joined to those teams doing risk

1055
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:50,190
assessments helping companies improve

1056
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:53,420
their security posture so more in that

1057
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:56,580
working in the office of the CISO and

1058
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,410
deciding the now deciding strategy for

1059
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,420
various aspects of tools we want to

1060
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,609
improve or different risks we want to

1061
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,620
minimize over in the next few years so

1062
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:07,050
that's my side of it it's not technical

1063
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:11,640
I'm not not networking not a programmer

1064
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:14,190
just more of that risk decisions so Jeff

1065
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,710
there was one a little ways back and it

1066
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:20,700
was a few but if you if you had

1067
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:23,460
these kind of certifications on your

1068
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:28,049
goal list and you had to pick one would

1069
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:30,840
you pick with the CISM or the CISSP I

1070
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:33,330
tell you cissp gets you more calls from

1071
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,150
recruiters so if that's what you're

1072
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,740
looking for then it's going to know it's

1073
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:42,750
it's more difficult I believe than

1074
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:44,490
getting the CISM so if you just feel

1075
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,900
like you need to get one and you want to

1076
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,180
you don't really you want to be done

1077
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,520
with it as fast as possible I'm not

1078
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,680
gonna say a CI system is easy but I

1079
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:56,070
would say that one's the that was easier

1080
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:58,730
for me the CISSP though the recruiters

1081
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,730
do call more
