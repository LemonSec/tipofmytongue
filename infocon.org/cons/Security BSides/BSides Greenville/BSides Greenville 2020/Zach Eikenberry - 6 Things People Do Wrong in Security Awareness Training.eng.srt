1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,960
let's get going all right

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,440
well thank you all for coming back after

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,120
lunch

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,399
to uh uh join me

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,279
and talking about something i'm pretty

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,800
passionate about which is training

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,480
um before uh

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,279
as we get started here i enjoyed a

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,320
uh the previous conversation on this

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,679
track on how to

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,800
bypass uh bitlocker and i i quickly

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,160
realized that

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,680
um my conversation my uh my topic today

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,319
is not gonna be as technical

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
although next year i am more than happy

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,760
to talk about

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,120
uh how people actually see things in the

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,039
world and

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,519
uh share a lot of research that i've

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,000
done on how roombas actually work

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,680
uh but that's a whole nother talk um

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,120
that is probably gonna be a ted talk one

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,519
day for us but

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,199
um i'm happy to do that in the future

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,879
today's talk we're going to go over

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,039
six things people do wrong in security

27
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,559
awareness training

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,960
and don't get me wrong there's going to

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,000
be a lot of

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,479
hope hopefully at the end but i wanted

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,720
to

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,080
to start off uh jumping in and saying

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,240
you know

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,840
who am i why is zach here this is my

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,039
first b-sides

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,159
um and uh what is it that i

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,159
i'm hoping to offer today so i'll start

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,080
with quickly with my bio a

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,079
farm boy from the middle of indiana went

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,439
to the big city in the big school

41
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,119
and uh got a philosophy degree and

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,520
like most people who get philosophy

43
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,640
degrees i realized that the

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,798
job market was very tough for me so

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,880
um at the age of 22 hired myself

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,399
i haven't looked back i've only had the

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,119
privilege of working for myself over the

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,600
years

49
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,360
started a number of companies most

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,559
recently

51
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,799
prior to hook security where i'm the ceo

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,640
and co-founder now

53
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,560
started the next schools in the upstate

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,079
of south carolina so two high schools in

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,280
middle school

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,720
for entrepreneurs and it'll be

57
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
self-evident throughout here but i'm

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,000
most certainly not

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,680
a graphic designer as a as a matter of

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
fact another thing that i did after

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,160
listening to

62
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,959
uh dr adam anderson's talk on how to

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,280
start a business

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,400
i realized that i needed more graphics

65
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,959
so you'll see

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,599
memes throughout here that are literally

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,480
the first

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,160
meme that i discovered when googling

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,679
something

70
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:37,680
for example i googled who am i meme

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,400
and this popped up so i

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
i shared this with you because it made

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,239
me laugh

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,200
and it's not wrong but uh it also has

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,760
nothing to do

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,399
with the presentation at hand so we're

77
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,879
gonna

78
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,040
i'm gonna jump pretty quickly into the

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,518
six things we do wrong because

80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,640
i have this intuition that most of you

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,920
in the audience

82
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,238
uh are aware vaguely or

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,319
acutely of the things we do wrong with

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,840
security awareness training so the power

85
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,599
of our presentation is not

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,159
in that topic but it's actually in

87
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,599
uh how we go about thinking and

88
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,679
addressing those

89
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,200
in 2020 so let me back up and talk about

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,800
something that i'm

91
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,879
um certainly incredibly passionate in

92
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,080
and that is public education

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,840
and i'd like to make a case that um as

94
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
we get going into

95
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,440
uh understanding our own security

96
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
awareness training

97
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,359
that it parallels a number of things

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,959
that we've discovered in our public

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,200
education model so

100
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,360
um some people might call me a public

101
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,959
education reformer or radical

102
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,280
but i don't think you can do that until

103
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,040
you really appreciated how we got the

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,400
public education system especially in

105
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,439
the u.s

106
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,920
that we have today and one way to think

107
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,799
about it

108
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,640
one layer of analysis would be to start

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,040
back at the early 20th century

110
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,839
and say it was quite a miracle

111
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,120
for us to go from having a population

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,959
where less than 20 percent of the

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,360
population was educated

114
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,319
to 80 percent over the course of 50

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,000
years that was

116
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,399
a remarkable journey that we were able

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,519
to do and we did it through this

118
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,719
um mass production batch processing one

119
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,400
size fits all

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,720
training now fast forward to

121
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,320
the last 40 years and i'll kind of give

122
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,320
you a heads up

123
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,919
and continue to shock people because

124
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,280
this is always shocking to me

125
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:41,680
1980 was 40 years ago

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,840
so fast forward to the 1980s

127
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,440
we started seeing some really crazy

128
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,638
trends in our public education

129
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,400
and that is we really couldn't get

130
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,120
past um an 80 graduation rate

131
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,479
or um what educators like to say rather

132
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,560
than call it a push out rate they like

133
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,280
to call the dropout rate

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,840
we got to a 20 dropout rate and that was

135
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,599
largely nationally

136
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,039
there are some different uh states

137
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,560
different regions that responded

138
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,960
differently to the public education

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,360
models that we had but

140
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,280
basically public education as it sits

141
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,120
today and that's true even in greenville

142
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,960
county in 2020 about

143
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,800
80 percent of the young people going

144
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,000
through it do really well

145
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,280
and 20 struggle immensely

146
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,320
so um i'd like to go ahead and make a

147
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,239
sweeping claim i'm happy to address this

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:38,080
if you are skeptical in the future

149
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,479
that we have built a corporate

150
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,719
training methodology and we have

151
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,240
mirrored our corporate training

152
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,320
based on the uh pedagogy that is

153
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,160
the way in which the methodologies in

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,520
the way in which we educate people

155
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,120
from 1995 to 2005. so what we did when

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,120
we came out with corporate training in

157
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,160
particular security awareness training

158
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,479
um as part of the infosec environment

159
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,639
we just said well if it was good enough

160
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,479
for how we learned in colleges and

161
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,400
high school and middle schools we're

162
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
going to take those same ways in which

163
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,960
we train and we're just going to put

164
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,560
them right over into our corporate

165
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,960
training experience so

166
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,840
you ended up with batch processing one

167
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,198
by one size fits all

168
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,679
um rote memorization training techniques

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,639
in our corporate training space so i say

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,960
that to say

171
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,479
we all know in 2020 we need to start

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,680
doing some things that are radically

173
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,039
different

174
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,199
my passion in corporate training is to

175
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,639
bring forward the latest in neuroscience

176
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,240
and our psychology

177
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,880
to disrupt the security awareness

178
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,960
training space i like to call it psysec

179
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,960
or psychological security as opposed to

180
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,000
infosec but that's not the point of this

181
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,400
talk

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,400
what i'm against that backdrop i want us

183
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,960
to stop and appreciate

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
the things that we really do wrong um

185
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,919
when it comes to our training and there

186
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,919
are much there are many more than just

187
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,440
six but these are the highlights

188
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,599
and i'm going to jump right in and

189
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,759
this right here would be the number one

190
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,759
thing um that we hear as an objection

191
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,000
so over the past few years as i've been

192
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,440
doing security awareness trading

193
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,319
we often get this listen there are a lot

194
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,560
of things

195
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,400
to do here in this organization there

196
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,319
are i appreciate security awareness

197
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,599
training i know it needs to be done

198
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,599
but we're going to get to it when it's

199
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,800
convenient right i gotta look at

200
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,719
everybody's schedule

201
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,840
we're gonna figure this out there's a

202
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,639
lot of things that have to come into

203
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,440
play

204
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,280
and essentially it boils down to a

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,800
convenience argument right

206
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,758
whenever it becomes um the easiest to do

207
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,680
that's when we'll strike and do it

208
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,199
so there are some questions that that

209
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,440
raises of course

210
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,319
um but primarily i want to i want us to

211
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,120
think okay

212
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,960
if that's a symptom if we're faced up

213
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,400
against and you're in an organization

214
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,440
that just does security awareness

215
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,479
training

216
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,919
when it's convenient

217
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,520
we're faced with a series of questions

218
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,240
but i want to point out and pull a

219
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,440
thread

220
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,960
that says you might need to ask

221
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,000
questions about your security culture

222
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,799
at your company at your organization and

223
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,840
even so i

224
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,000
i would say most of the time it's hard

225
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
to figure out exactly

226
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,280
why we're only doing security awareness

227
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,359
when it's training if there's not even a

228
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,000
clear decision maker or an owner within

229
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,000
the organization on who's in charge

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,080
of the company schedule and where this

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
fits in

232
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,599
uh this is the meme that you get when

233
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,399
you uh

234
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,679
do convenience meme apparently karen

235
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,519
wants to talk to the manager when it's

236
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,559
convenient

237
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,880
the second thing that uh

238
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,800
that you probably do wrong or i'll say

239
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,560
we it might be mean for me to point a

240
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,479
finger at all of you but uh

241
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,839
i'll say we it's kind of like the

242
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,600
seinfeld we

243
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,519
um you only provide annual training

244
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,279
okay and and i get this you're right

245
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,480
like for years

246
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,560
since the early 2000s late 90s

247
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,839
when the security profession really

248
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
became formalized

249
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,440
it was a best practice to do security

250
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,199
awareness training annually right like

251
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,839
best practice is to go everything once a

252
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,200
year right

253
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,480
but we have some issues with that

254
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,480
one of the first things i want to point

255
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,200
out is like how long does it take

256
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,399
you just you personally i'm pointing at

257
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,000
pointing at all of you on the

258
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,200
on the talk to forget new information

259
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,480
all right so i i sometimes i like to do

260
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,120
this i'll go ahead and do it right now

261
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
but

262
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,720
if i ask you right now what was the

263
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,200
first thing we just talked about 15

264
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,040
seconds ago

265
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
there's a number of you that will pause

266
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,560
and have to concentrate and say oh

267
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,319
we talked about convenience yes

268
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,719
but that information is just 20 seconds

269
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,720
old what happens to information when

270
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,560
it's 300 days old

271
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,920
right and how long does it take you to

272
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,239
forget

273
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,120
and there's a whole body of research

274
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,160
around

275
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,760
how people actually

276
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,360
or what annual experience is due

277
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,760
and how people remember annual

278
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
experiences and you have a part of your

279
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,600
brain

280
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,279
that remembers traditions um and that's

281
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,920
a fascinating part of this narrative

282
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,480
structure

283
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,279
of our brains i'm gonna pause right

284
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,920
there

285
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,680
and say one thing just this level set on

286
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,719
your neurology what's going on in your

287
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,920
head

288
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,600
um as of late in the

289
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,599
in the neuroscience psychological field

290
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,160
there's finally been agreement

291
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,040
that you have multiple brains kind of

292
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,640
like you have

293
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,880
multiple muscles in your hand i think

294
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,279
your hand has like 18 muscles

295
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,120
um you arguably have somewhere between

296
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,880
five and nine brains

297
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,839
that work together so you don't have

298
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,760
just one brain you have a number of

299
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,440
brains and there's one of those brains

300
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,959
that actually resonates really well with

301
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,880
traditions

302
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,560
and it looks like if you want to set a

303
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,160
memory or some

304
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,079
way in which you remember things year

305
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,719
after year there needs to be food

306
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,399
involved

307
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,160
there needs to be songs there needs to

308
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,760
be enjoyable experiences over time

309
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,439
and you can actually develop traditions

310
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,000
well uh

311
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,600
think of it like christmas or easter or

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,880
thanksgiving those are oftentimes

313
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,200
trained

314
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,279
traditions in our heads because those

315
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,440
are annual experiences that have a lot

316
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,519
of other things to them

317
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,640
i'm not aware of anybody having a set

318
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,480
meal and songs

319
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,680
and enjoyable experiences on like

320
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
veterans day

321
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,000
right and what happens is that you end

322
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,199
up forgetting

323
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,720
those traditions moreover than you do

324
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,000
the other traditions but i

325
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,120
i digress to say that if you're actually

326
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,800
focused on creating

327
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,959
security awareness across your

328
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,120
organization at a habitual level

329
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,160
that daily all of the users in the

330
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,120
organization

331
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,079
are aware of when they're secure and

332
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,079
when they're vulnerable

333
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,240
annual training does not hit that part

334
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,600
of the brain and it does not work

335
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,440
effectively there

336
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,920
even if it becomes a tradition in your

337
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,360
organization

338
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,360
this is what happens when you type in

339
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,519
annual meme apparently

340
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,600
every year he comes back all right

341
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,200
third thing you do wrong you do it all

342
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,360
at once

343
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,240
right this is usually just a practical

344
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,600
matter it's

345
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,360
hey it's really hard to get our

346
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,399
organization no matter if it's just two

347
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,480
or three people

348
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,440
or three four hundred several thousand

349
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,720
folks

350
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,240
it's incredibly difficult to get

351
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,760
anybody's attention on this so when i

352
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
get everybody's attention i'm gonna go

353
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,920
over

354
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,680
everything okay uh again there's some

355
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,399
there's some memory errors but i'm gonna

356
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,319
i'm gonna point to

357
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,000
what you really have is a coverage and

358
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,240
dilution error

359
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,320
and what happens in training where you

360
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,040
go over everything frankly if you go

361
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,920
past two i know we we violated that

362
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,399
issue with six

363
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,519
on here but the subtitle of my talk is

364
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,240
you might remember

365
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,360
one of these six items so pick one that

366
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,639
you want to remember and that's what

367
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,240
you'll keep

368
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,320
what you actually end up having is a

369
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,200
coverage or dilution error

370
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,480
and that is when everything's important

371
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,320
nothing is important

372
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,839
and when you come to an organization you

373
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,680
say listen it's incredibly important

374
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,000
that you lock your desk clean your desk

375
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,519
make sure that you don't click a

376
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,839
phishing email make sure that

377
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,800
you change your password make sure that

378
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,480
you're

379
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,920
properly patched make sure that you talk

380
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,680
to somebody if you see this

381
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,519
if all of those things are equally

382
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,279
important to the end user

383
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,800
all at once and they're given to them

384
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,959
all at once

385
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,880
it's impossible for those users to

386
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,839
actually adopt those habits because

387
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,560
they have they done you've diluted the

388
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,000
effect of

389
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,760
priority and what's important to

390
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,079
remember

391
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,079
right that's another memory meme

392
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,000
number four i see this actually quite

393
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,000
common you avoid

394
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,920
training executives and your contractors

395
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
right people who have disproportion and

396
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,599
influence to your organization

397
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,760
and it's just like listen don't get me

398
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,760
started

399
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,519
every security professional that i've

400
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,240
met who is involved in awareness

401
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,120
training at some level

402
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,320
hates this argument hates this fight

403
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,600
zach i get it

404
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,800
i don't know why you brought it up but

405
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,360
i argue all the time that the ceo needs

406
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,719
train

407
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,320
they need to do this too etc well

408
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,320
um i want to flip the script

409
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,600
and make make an interesting argument

410
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,480
here that

411
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,079
uh your executives or one of the key

412
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,959
things that we found

413
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,719
with executives when you do studies and

414
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,599
small business owners and executives

415
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,760
actually

416
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,279
do perform different so i i won't get

417
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,240
into the data there but if you allow me

418
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,839
to aggregate it all together

419
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,320
in general executives managers

420
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,079
leaders and organizations are more

421
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,320
open-minded

422
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,519
when they feel empowered to know what's

423
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,839
happening right so there

424
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,839
there's a curiosity level that is much

425
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,440
higher in the c-suite than anywhere else

426
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,560
and that might strike you as odd because

427
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,320
the c-suite might hit you back in a way

428
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,518
that you think that they're not actually

429
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,760
curious

430
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,839
um but the the data shows that

431
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,000
fundamentally leaders and executives are

432
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,560
curious so when it comes to training

433
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,839
one of the big fallacies that um

434
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,279
training um

435
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,760
solution providers do right now is they

436
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,279
train

437
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,199
executives in the same way that they

438
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,079
train other users and people in the

439
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,240
organization

440
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,519
and they don't focus on the curiosity

441
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,680
let me

442
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,519
go ahead and give out one possible

443
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,199
solution to this because it might help

444
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,600
illuminate it for you the

445
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,040
the difference between training people

446
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,079
on how to lock doors

447
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,599
and how to pick locks okay when we

448
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,040
approach executives and people in

449
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,680
leadership

450
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,079
um there's a level of how do you empower

451
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
them

452
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,439
so that they know they can do something

453
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,239
with the information

454
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,160
so in an organization traditionally you

455
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,600
just train people how to lock your doors

456
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,920
these are the things you need to do to

457
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,680
be

458
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,279
safe well the data shows and the

459
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,519
research shows that if you approach

460
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,360
executives with that same material

461
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,959
there's often a tremendous drop off

462
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,360
of attention because it doesn't hit

463
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,920
their curiosity however if you train

464
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,959
them

465
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,759
on how to pick locks your executives

466
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,680
will not only

467
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,519
feel empowered and their curiosity will

468
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,800
be met but they will

469
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,839
know also the importance of locking

470
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,839
doors

471
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,279
so you end up with different content

472
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,720
experiences

473
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,480
for your leadership and for your

474
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,160
managers but

475
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,519
that's one thing we do wrong is we

476
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,680
rather not fight that fight

477
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,279
and we want to have one size fits all

478
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,800
and so we want everybody to go through

479
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,320
the same training at the same way at the

480
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,599
same time

481
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:51,199
so um

482
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,399
you are using old content so

483
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,439
this uh this is this is a debatable

484
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,639
thing out there i

485
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,959
but i will say uh if you

486
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,839
are using the same training content year

487
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,240
after year

488
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,000
annually for your organizations and it's

489
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,720
two or three years old and you know it

490
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,039
is

491
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,199
but that's the library you purchased

492
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,919
from some solution provider

493
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,160
um you know it's bad everybody knows

494
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,640
it's bad it's the best that's out there

495
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,120
and you're using an old library you're

496
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,640
just like does it even expire

497
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:28,000
my argument is yes right um when running

498
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,520
um the schools like we were um i quickly

499
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,520
made a ban

500
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,520
you know banned for bid textbooks to

501
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,360
enter the school

502
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,559
and that's because the take for example

503
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,199
like a science tech

504
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,480
textbook the second you hit print on a

505
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,280
science textbook

506
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,919
it's outdated right the delivery of a

507
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,760
textbook

508
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,160
to an end user at that point in time

509
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,240
it's just dangerous and sloppy

510
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,760
and so like i like to point out when

511
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,960
we're talking with folks about

512
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,640
their content do you even

513
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,760
remember two years ago just 2018

514
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,919
the most popular netflix originals

515
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,360
right and i i i usually ask this

516
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,280
question out there

517
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,199
um or even like game of thrones like we

518
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,799
just went through a whole quarantine

519
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,160
and i think it's hilarious that nobody

520
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,559
watched game of thrones but that's

521
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,880
because of a whole nother set of issues

522
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,080
but that's because the content we

523
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,919
consume

524
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,918
does have an expiration it does have a

525
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,280
shelf life most content

526
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,000
is not timeless um but if you're curious

527
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,200
here are the uh here are the top

528
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,720
consumed and

529
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,400
netflix doesn't actually release the

530
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,360
data on this so this is done by third

531
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,120
party

532
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
they say these were the top five in

533
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,760
order um house of cards didn't even make

534
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,879
it

535
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,440
and you might have thought house of

536
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,640
cards but uh these were the top five in

537
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,320
2018

538
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,320
uh consume netflix originals

539
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,720
the last thing that we see people doing

540
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,559
wrong in their security

541
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,240
training is they just do it for

542
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,918
compliance purposes

543
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,120
right and it's like hey all these guys

544
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,960
are the same

545
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,439
everybody is in the same so we just do

546
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,440
whatever it takes to be compliant

547
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,520
i've got other things to do i'm in the

548
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,640
middle of putting out 100 other fires

549
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,840
every day

550
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,559
um and i just we need this to be

551
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,399
compliant

552
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,000
i don't care it's just part of the cost

553
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,039
of doing business we're going to roll it

554
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,919
out with the compliance motivation

555
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,480
and i do think this is one that requires

556
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,679
a level of self-awareness by the

557
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,679
security advisor or

558
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:33,120
security employee of the security leader

559
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,520
in an organization whatever you fit

560
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,559
understanding the motivations of your

561
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,120
organization is

562
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,960
paramount to being able to sidestep

563
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,120
compliance motivation which is

564
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,640
you have to do it it's not voluntary

565
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,399
it's compulsory

566
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,080
get over it do this training

567
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,720
each organization can be different and

568
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,000
this is the beauty of

569
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,679
different organizations and i i would

570
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,080
encourage you if you're actually trying

571
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,320
to

572
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,439
sidestep and move away from a compliance

573
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,960
motivation

574
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,679
there's something you probably need to

575
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,240
do and then and this might surprise you

576
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,799
you might actually need to survey an

577
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,280
interview

578
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,200
and talk with each of the individual

579
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,320
users and employees

580
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,679
so one of the things that i think a

581
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,200
number of organizations get

582
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,120
wrong is they only leave the decision on

583
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,159
how to be compliant

584
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:29,280
to the leadership teams and

585
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,840
what happens when you get compulsory or

586
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,960
involuntary adoption throughout the

587
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,639
organization

588
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,400
is the same thing you see with torture

589
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,480
right um

590
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,320
torturing we have found out in the last

591
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,000
few years doesn't actually get

592
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,080
information from the person being

593
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,200
tortured so if we're trying to take an

594
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,960
actor and get information out of him

595
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,559
torturing is about the worst way to do

596
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,880
that um

597
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,639
what we've actually found is that um

598
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,559
torturing leads to people saying

599
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,000
whatever they need to say

600
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,080
to end the torturing immediately and

601
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,679
um you can draw a very quick parallel

602
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,480
between that and your compliance

603
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,200
training

604
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,919
that people are just answering and doing

605
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,799
whatever

606
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,080
minimal viable thing they can do to be

607
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,918
done with the compliance training

608
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,158
whatever you think you need to hear

609
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,400
i will swear to you that i have never

610
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,880
click another phishing email again

611
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,320
uh cross cross my heart hope to die i

612
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,000
will do everything just please let the

613
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,678
compliance training move on so i can get

614
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,799
back to my actual work

615
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,520
uh but if you actually bring

616
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,879
the interviews and decision making on

617
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,440
how to be compliant

618
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,240
down further in your culture and in your

619
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,320
organization

620
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,440
i think you'll you'll discover alternate

621
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,399
alternative

622
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,080
ways to motivate your company so here's

623
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,440
some data because i know that you're all

624
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,399
very interested in data

625
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,320
this is actually pre-covid numbers um

626
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,919
some of the ways we do training are

627
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,039
going to fundamentally shift

628
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,799
with the remote workforce rise

629
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,559
however i will say there are some trend

630
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,879
lines in here that ilt

631
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,639
and vilt which is instructor-led

632
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,840
training video instructor-led training

633
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,799
those are on the decline as you move

634
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,000
into

635
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,400
different learning management tools and

636
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,320
i i'm proud to say that our organization

637
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,960
and a number of other organizations in

638
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,879
the space

639
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,000
are starting to actually personalize and

640
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,240
customize

641
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,440
the training uh down to the level of the

642
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,000
individual

643
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,000
so um those tools are coming out where

644
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,240
we no longer do a one-size-fits-all

645
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,039
everybody gets the same training we

646
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,799
start giving

647
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,400
different training experiences to

648
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,918
different types of learners different

649
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,440
personalities different groups and

650
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,360
departments within the organization get

651
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,280
differentiated training so

652
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,199
that's on the rise and that's good to

653
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,480
see that's something i'm personally

654
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,000
passionate about and that's

655
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,919
the work that i do every day

656
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,760
but i will talk about a surprising thing

657
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,960
just to get you guys going if you're

658
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,039
stuck in an organization that works with

659
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,000
the compliance motivation

660
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,360
and that's that's simply to say here's

661
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,919
some data

662
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,360
uh from i believe the sample said it's

663
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,240
actually only about a thousand

664
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,280
employees so it's not a large set but

665
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,280
you can see

666
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,280
that employees do want to receive more

667
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,360
training by and large

668
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,280
that by and large people would like to

669
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,240
know more be better at their job do more

670
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,039
meaningful work

671
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,000
day in and day out but as you can see on

672
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,760
here

673
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,240
um if you tie in training

674
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,360
with the opportunities to be promoted

675
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,080
which are higher

676
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,918
um not it's not just compensation along

677
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,240
the promotion but also recognition or

678
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,720
more influence within the organization

679
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,400
if you tie in your security awareness

680
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,720
training and your compliance training

681
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,600
two people's motivations on being

682
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,720
promoted

683
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,760
you can see that people actually

684
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,240
demand this your users will demand it

685
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,520
um so that is a cultural thing a policy

686
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,640
in your organization to

687
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,279
to champion but um i can only send you

688
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,080
more data

689
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,880
on exactly how to overcome number six

690
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,840
but i i

691
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,400
figured this would help enlighten it so

692
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,120
um

693
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,039
i'll confess this was uh meme number two

694
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,039
the first one of course uh

695
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,640
is the original but uh that's still

696
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,600
painful for me but

697
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,400
um help me zack your only hope you just

698
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,840
told me

699
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,520
in a very fast overview there are six

700
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,760
things we do wrong

701
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,639
true to form i only remember a handful

702
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,840
of them

703
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,000
i'll have to go back and look at your

704
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,279
slides to try to remember all six

705
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,480
but what could we do about these

706
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:35,520
right so what

707
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,360
what do you do about these and this

708
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,840
slide actually has a lot of things to be

709
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,000
unpacked and i'm sorry i didn't um

710
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:45,439
make this one slide into 10 slides so

711
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,919
that you could review them later

712
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,039
however i want to start with a bit of

713
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,400
inspiration

714
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,080
if you're find yourself in an

715
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,640
organization that's committing any of

716
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,000
these six

717
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:00,000
things how do you even start having

718
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,480
conversations in order to address um

719
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,760
these these issues these these wrongs as

720
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,720
it were

721
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,240
oh and i think there's some interesting

722
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
questions you can begin to ask yourself

723
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,520
when you benchmark

724
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,120
your security culture against the rest

725
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,400
of your culture and say how do you

726
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,639
integrate those two

727
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,080
you know you can just start asking how

728
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,679
many times do we have

729
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,559
sales meetings in a week a quarter or

730
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,480
a month a year and how often do we have

731
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,760
security focus meetings

732
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,120
right or uh how much

733
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,200
of our sales collateral brags about our

734
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,918
security posture and environment

735
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,360
um at our organization how much of our

736
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,159
security

737
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,479
position is being utilized to secure

738
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,400
more

739
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,240
revenues and help our company grow right

740
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,760
how much of the things that we're doing

741
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,799
internally with our security

742
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,320
are helping our marketing team

743
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,760
promote their digital properties and

744
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,039
showcase what we do or how many times

745
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,200
are you talking about

746
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,360
with your current client base your

747
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,679
security culture and the posture

748
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,279
and you'll notice that it becomes a lot

749
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,080
easier to address

750
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,360
these issues when these things are on

751
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,879
your radar

752
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,399
and that might mean that you have to

753
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,279
think of yourself differently within the

754
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,520
organization

755
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,440
and there's a level of business acumen

756
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,440
that you have to be empathetic to what's

757
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,200
going on in the other departments

758
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,720
right you'll have to get your head above

759
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,360
all the fires you're putting out every

760
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,799
day

761
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,399
but these are some questions i think

762
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,918
that will really help

763
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,720
gain the traction so you can address

764
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,360
these these issues right

765
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,799
i do think i highly highlighted this as

766
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,840
we went through

767
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,879
but this is just kind of one of those

768
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,279
things that you might have

769
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,880
the data just shows you'll have to treat

770
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,440
your executives differently and

771
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,799
leverage their skill sets differently in

772
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,919
the security awareness training

773
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,520
right um i'm not really going to get

774
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,120
into skeptic versus critical

775
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,320
understandings

776
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,360
um because there's a lot to unpack there

777
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,439
when approaching

778
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,639
an executive or someone that's higher up

779
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,880
in the hierarchy

780
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,960
and you're trying to advocate for

781
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,120
different security awareness postures

782
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,320
trainings

783
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,039
programs whether you're dealing with a

784
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,480
skeptical

785
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,240
leader or a critical leader but at a

786
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,720
high level a skeptical leader

787
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,520
has a standard and your goal is to meet

788
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,880
that standard

789
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:25,440
a critical leader has no understanding

790
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,159
and has no level in which a standard in

791
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,399
which you can

792
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,559
make them happy and if you find yourself

793
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,239
in a critical environment you have

794
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,240
to do a lot more work to get a little

795
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,679
done

796
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,360
like i've mentioned show them how to

797
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,960
pick locks not to lock doors use a

798
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,360
curiosity against them

799
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,799
and and i will say this in the long run

800
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,918
um if you are

801
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,918
utilizing fear-based tactics to get

802
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,039
your executive's attention on your

803
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,679
security awareness training posture

804
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,080
it won't get attention in the long run

805
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,159
fear

806
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,360
is actually built around short attention

807
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,080
span bursts

808
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,959
so if you go to your executive and say

809
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,918
hey

810
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,200
uh if we don't do this we're we're going

811
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,080
to get hacked we're 200

812
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,720
more likely to do blah blah blah blah

813
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,039
right

814
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,520
you don't you might get their attention

815
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,200
for the next 15 minutes in a meeting

816
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,720
but you won't get their ongoing

817
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,640
attention as they go

818
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,919
back to the things that they can

819
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,640
actually think through

820
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,080
so your job as a security professional

821
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,360
if you're trying to address these wrongs

822
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,799
in your training app or

823
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,439
apparatus as it were clarity is what

824
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,720
wins

825
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,240
going to them with clear thoughts on how

826
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,440
this work going to them

827
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,080
with your benchmarks going to them with

828
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,520
what they can actually do in effect over

829
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,480
time

830
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,440
so um that goes into the next thing um

831
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,000
some of my

832
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,600
recommendations set small steps and

833
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,279
milestones

834
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,320
um do the security awareness training

835
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,000
before you answer

836
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,960
tech support that's that has to do with

837
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,720
the policy but essentially saying

838
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,159
while people are working with you if

839
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,799
they have a technical support

840
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,000
issue or some sort of other support

841
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,039
issue

842
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,960
when you're engaged in those

843
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,000
conversations with those users is a

844
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,480
great time to

845
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,159
ask them where they are in their

846
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,399
security awareness training

847
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,399
progress how they think about it etc

848
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,080
and manage through security objectives

849
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,440
and prioritize conversations

850
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,279
you're going to run into dilution

851
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,720
coverage error if you try to solve

852
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,799
all of your security awareness training

853
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,440
problems at once okay

854
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,480
you just will pick your battles that's

855
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,919
another way to say this

856
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,679
the objectives that you really want to

857
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,840
cover and aim at that

858
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,840
um i have a mentor say that your

859
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,639
calendar shows your priorities

860
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,879
so if you do have a company calendar um

861
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,640
what is calendared wins

862
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,039
and those are the priorities of your

863
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,440
organization so i encourage you to keep

864
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,480
keep a close eye on those on the

865
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,559
calendar

866
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,399
and make sure that your organization's

867
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,840
priorities show up on that calendar and

868
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,120
if security awareness training

869
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,959
is won it should show up all right and

870
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,918
and i and i'll always acknowledge

871
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,120
that businesses these organizations uh

872
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,799
adam anderson

873
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,520
did this awesome talk about how to start

874
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:19,600
your own um

875
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,760
the business is irreducibly complex

876
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,678
right unfortunately you can't just show

877
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,200
up to business uh business every day and

878
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,840
say hey if we just do these one or two

879
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,600
things right

880
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,520
everything will work it's not how it

881
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,279
works anymore unfortunately there's a

882
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,960
list of a hundred things that a business

883
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,279
has to get right every single day

884
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,320
and it's irreducibly complex that's just

885
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,440
what it is

886
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,918
and your security awareness uh

887
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,039
posture might not be in the top 10

888
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,360
things that your company has to get

889
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,200
right

890
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,879
might not be in the top 20. you know

891
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,320
when i interview people and i ask them

892
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,240
conceptually where does security

893
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,240
awareness training fit into the top 100

894
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,480
things your company has to do every day

895
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,520
they say somewhere between 60 and 80

896
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,279
right

897
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,960
um they and so when you're when you're

898
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,399
working through that that's not always a

899
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,519
bad thing

900
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,840
but the question is uh does

901
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,600
it get the respect it deserves at

902
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,360
whatever level priority it is in your

903
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,559
company and is that showing up on your

904
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,600
company's calendars

905
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,960
right uh always taking

906
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,039
opportunities to interview the users

907
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,480
how they enjoy the security awareness

908
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,559
training how they're learning what they

909
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,720
remember what they're intimidated by

910
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,559
how to help them do their work better

911
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,159
and and i'll say this this is just kind

912
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,279
of a lasting idea

913
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,679
this is one of my soap boxes in

914
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,360
uh security professionals and training

915
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,640
in general

916
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:46,158
if you make other people better

917
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,519
at their jobs focus on their wins

918
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:51,440
you will avoid a number of these wrong

919
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,159
issues when it comes to your training

920
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,720
right if you help your field sales

921
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,159
people

922
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,120
understand how that their security

923
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,279
awareness training

924
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,799
isn't just a defensive move but it's an

925
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,519
offensive move that they can

926
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,559
get more deals have better conversations

927
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,880
move forward

928
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,399
the ball and de-risk not only the past

929
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,600
things that the company's achieved

930
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:16,959
but the future de-risking the future

931
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:20,080
is the next uh foreground of

932
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,320
uh our security um

933
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,678
work and i think security awareness

934
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,360
training helping people

935
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,279
do their jobs better and focusing on

936
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,639
their wins makes it happen

937
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:32,480
so um

938
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,840

can you hear me yep okay great so my

1010
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:20,960
question is around um if you have

1011
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,480
you know regular campaigns or content

1012
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,240
around security awareness so what's the

1013
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,880
length of that

1014
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,479
content or training each time you

1015
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,800

1017
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,760
question um

1018
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,800
so it depends on what you're trying to

1019
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,359
accomplish so on the

1020
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,920
uh regularity of it i'll say if you're

1021
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,680
trying to help your organization form

1022
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,440
patterns

1023
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,919
pattern recognition comes somewhere

1024
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,280
around 14 to 21 days

1025
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,960
so you know that that loosely lines up

1026
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,200
with monthly

1027
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,280
that's what we do with our organization

1028
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,439
is train out monthly

1029
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,119
um but that's rounding up if you're uh

1030
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,480
if you're purist with the data you're

1031
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,839
going to try to

1032
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,000
um build habits around 21 day schedules

1033
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,440
um so that's the first part the second

1034
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,960
it depends on what part of the brain

1035
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,000
that you're trying to engage with the

1036
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,200
training so

1037
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,400
um to make it real

1038
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,759
simple there's cognitive processes

1039
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,560
and there are psychological processes

1040
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,960
if you're trying to engage people to

1041
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,799
think

1042
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,079
differently and engage the frontal

1043
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,280
cortex and the cognitive pieces

1044
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,079
your training can be detailed

1045
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,920
and it can be you know we actually have

1046
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,640
a longer attention span than we thought

1047
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,000
uh

1048
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,598
tvs uh and commercials actually assume

1049
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,640
the wrong thing about how you think

1050
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,119
about things

1051
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,839
um that training can be up to eight

1052
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,880
minutes

1053
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,040
um as long as it's focused and engaging

1054
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,480
with the cognitive part of your brain if

1055
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,040
you're trying to teach people to

1056
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,680
recognize things like phishing attacks

1057
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,320
um you should really focus on really low

1058
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,040
vision

1059
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,839
opportunities which are humorous

1060
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,880
narratives

1061
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,400
or tragic narratives that are less than

1062
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,160
90 seconds

1063
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,240
and you can you can see some data that

1064
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,279
you really only get

1065
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,399
six seconds uh uh pure contact with uh

1066
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,480
there's two parts of your brain that

1067
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,079
you're engaging your amygdala and your

1068
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,200
hippocampus

1069
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,119
so if you're training monthly

1070
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,240
and your goal is to get people to think

1071
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,000
differently

1072
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,759
you shouldn't be afraid of content that

1073
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,440
goes up to eight minutes

1074
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,200
including any sort of assessment if

1075
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,079
you're trying to get people to recognize

1076
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,118
things um your training should be less

1077
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,440
than 90 seconds

1078
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,240
and it should be humorous or tragic

1079
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,920
that's

1080
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,598
that's my understanding of the current

1081
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,560
data

1082
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,760
i think you have one other question so

1083
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,640
how do you help

1084
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,359
people in business to see the

1085
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,200
correlation between their personal lives

1086
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,960
and security and what they do in

1087
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,000
business because

1088
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,359
often with security awareness

1089
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,839
i find people in business like when okay

1090
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,799
here's the compliance people

1091
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,279
here's that fishing test that's coming

1092
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,000
out

1093
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,040
again and then they just sort of get

1094
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,160
through it

1095
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,720
but they don't see

1096
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,118
you know not that they're perfectly

1097
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,240
focused on security in their personal

1098
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,720
lives but

1099
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,520
sort of how you get them to see the

1100
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,480
alignment

1101
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,520
of the two so they're more motivated to

1102
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,760
be secure

1103
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,759
inside or outside of the house if you

1104
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,040
will

1105
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,079
yeah that's a so um that's actually a

1106
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,200
really great question

1107
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,240
and there's going to be part of my

1108
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,520
answer that um is not that helpful

1109
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,879
but um you're you're tagging on uh

1110
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,720
perhaps a psychological phenomenon known

1111
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,640
as the hawthorne effect

1112
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,200
and the the hawthorne effect is simply

1113
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,920
this it's best demonstrated by a study

1114
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,200
where they would have a uh honor system

1115
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,720
for coffee

1116
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,160
uh set up in a you know a work lounge

1117
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,359
and you know coffee was 50 cents and

1118
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,960
what did they discover well about over

1119
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,000
time if you do the study enough about

1120
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,800
half the people

1121
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,440
will pay for the honor coffee right and

1122
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,280
they

1123
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,960
typically will prepay they'll put in a

1124
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,880
dollar and maybe you know

1125
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,240
get two cups or you know they'll forget

1126
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,280
about them put a dollar in every day

1127
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,078
because they know other people aren't

1128
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,839
paying

1129
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,000
but about 50 percent of people pay and

1130
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,759
not pay that tends to be a good

1131
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,280
breakdown of the data

1132
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:40,079
um it what happens if you put

1133
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,280
a security camera uh right above the

1134
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,680
coffee machine

1135
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,480
well um you find that about a hundred

1136
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,520
percent of people

1137
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,599
start paying right overnight

1138
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,720
uh but here's the here's the interesting

1139
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,200
thing if i

1140
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,959
set either a stuffed animal or a set of

1141
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,879
like googly eyes on top of the coffee

1142
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,680
machine you know the compliance right

1143
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,359
there

1144
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,839
with people who will pay in the honor

1145
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:05,040
system 100

1146
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:07,599
wow really yeah so and because

1147
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,279
once people feel like they're seen they

1148
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,480
do different behaviors

1149
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,000
so if people do not feel seen they take

1150
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,520
different types of risk they don't they

1151
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,400
don't get less risky they just take

1152
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,640
different types

1153
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,000
um so all they have to do is feel like

1154
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,879
there's some sort

1155
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,560
of living thing looking at them and they

1156
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,920
change their behavior so

1157
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,160
um one of the things that you see

1158
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,240
between people um

1159
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,759
moving from you know business

1160
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,040
environments in which they're monitored

1161
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,720
and they feel seen

1162
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,040
to unseen things like in their own

1163
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,680
personal lives is the googly eyes go

1164
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,440
away

1165
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,040
right so um i'm going to offer it up as

1166
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
a challenge i think there are ways in

1167
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
which

1168
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,560
we can help people understand that

1169
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,960
they're being seen

1170
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,720
um while still at home you asked the

1171
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,160
exact right word you said how to he'll

1172
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,040
help people see things

1173
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,759
helping people see things um is is one

1174
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,119
of the great challenges of the training

1175
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:05,040
industry i will say

1176
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,359
that there's probably

1177
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,800
uh tools and ways in which you can

1178
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:13,200
enlighten your users

1179
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,240
on how they're being seen right so um

1180
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,839
there's uh or let me back up rather than

1181
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,000
telling people all the dangers of what

1182
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:23,759
happens when their data is sold etc

1183
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,960
and you know all most of your personal

1184
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,839
users go home and use

1185
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,920
you know alexa or google home or

1186
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:33,279
something actually my alexa just

1187
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,400
turned on when i said that um

1188
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,480
you you start to show them um

1189
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,920
what that means and how people are

1190
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,960
watching them at home

1191
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,640
on their other devices um and helping

1192
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,400
them realize what data is actually

1193
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,160
getting out and what is not

1194
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,760
so breaking it down from a a big scary

1195
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,759
boogie man that they can't do anything

1196
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,560
about to something that's a small little

1197
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,160
dragon that

1198
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,400
they just need to make sure they know

1199
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,759
they're being watched is probably

1200
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,000
um a great strategy but the tactics in

1201
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,319
there

1202
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,119
i'll say are still on the frontier of

1203
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:08,560
psychological training

1204
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,560
that's why you don't like my answer in

1205
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:17,839
full yeah

1206
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,839
thank you

1207
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,000
well can i perform a quick um zoom poll

1208
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,119
and ask you to use the zoom reaction to

1209
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,040
raise your hand

1210
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,200
to indicate if your company that you

1211
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,800
work for exhibits the problems that zach

1212
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,759
identified at the beginning

1213
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,760
of the presentation

1214
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,400
all right um i've never heard the

1215
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,000
analogy before between security

1216
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,119
awareness training and torture that's

1217
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,160
the first time i've heard

1218
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,160
that analogy before

1219
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,078
are there any other questions for zach

1220
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,079
today

1221
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,920
i did get one in the zoom chat that i

1222
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,040
can share out

1223
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:06,160
uh where it did have a question about

1224
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:09,520
frequency where um how to

1225
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,960
i'm going to read into it but the says

1226
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,040
um seems the frequency could easily get

1227
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,160
too frequent where members revolt

1228
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:21,759
any advice on how to balance uh memory

1229
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:25,040
versus training pushback um

1230
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,960
yes you're absolutely right um if

1231
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,480
something um seems to be taking a

1232
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,839
greater priority than the

1233
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,480
organization's culture um lens then

1234
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,520
the organization has to push back so if

1235
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,839
you

1236
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,040
are doing let's say fishing simulations

1237
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,000
as part of your training and you're

1238
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,240
doing those too

1239
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,319
frequently and you're disrupting the

1240
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,799
business day

1241
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:50,240
while these sales people accounting

1242
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,000
folks operational

1243
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,919
researchers etc are trying to get their

1244
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,839
work done

1245
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,480
and they have other priorities other

1246
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:01,119
than your phishing simulation

1247
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,400
they will revolt because the culture is

1248
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,160
there to protect

1249
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,200
their domain of expertise and the things

1250
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,598
that they're hired to do so

1251
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,240
if you if you live in an organization

1252
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,560
that

1253
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,000
champions the security awareness

1254
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,599
training and it becomes a higher and

1255
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,560
higher priority you'll see less and less

1256
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,240
pushback but

1257
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,078
this is one of those subjective things

1258
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,319
where you'll need to know

1259
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,079
um where security awareness training

1260
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,240
fits into your organization today

1261
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,760
and where it needs to fit in tomorrow

1262
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,680
and your frequency

1263
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,880
should be around there again that's part

1264
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,799
of the reason we

1265
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,640
you know we typically land on monthly um

1266
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,599
even though the data shows 21 days

1267
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,640
because if you really are trying to

1268
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,720
push within 21 day windows um training

1269
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,960
experiences to folks

1270
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,879
many organizations are not there yet and

1271
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,800
they're going to rebel and push back in

1272
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,520
order protect their other priorities

1273
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,760
so that's that's that's my best thought

1274
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,720
um so if you are going to try to

1275
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,480
um uh try to get more frequency and in

1276
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,078
that 21 day window

1277
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,760
um i recommend starting with

1278
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,839
benchmarking your culture having

1279
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,680
conversations with the executives

1280
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,040
working through that buy-in process over

1281
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,078
time where you're interviewing your

1282
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,079
users

1283
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,520
and all of that will culminate after

1284
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,160
years of

1285
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,839
pushing into a culture that actually

1286
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,839
wants the security awareness training

1287
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,680
great great thank you any other

1288
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,759
questions today

1289
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,040
i have another question sorry to

1290
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,480
dominate

1291
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:38,079
um how do you monetize

1292
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,839
um you know security awareness

1293
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:45,280
results so i think sometimes in business

1294
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:47,680
it's you know the

1295
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,640
business leaders want you know the

1296
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,319
fishing

1297
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:54,640
activities to happen but

1298
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,680
you know there there's other things

1299
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,960
where they see

1300
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:02,640
direct correlation with the revenue or

1301
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,800
performance so what kpis or how do you

1302
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,078
monetize the results of what you're

1303
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,359
doing

1304
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,359
without there being a breach

1305
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,839
i'm not sure i completely understand

1306
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,160
your question

1307
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,200
so i apologize if i if i repeat this

1308
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,480
back to you but

1309
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,960
um how do you

1310
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,599
utilize the results of your your

1311
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,880
training

1312
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,079
in order to push forward with the other

1313
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,040
company's objectives

1314
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,599
yeah let me ask it a different way how

1315
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,640
do you

1316
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:38,319
show that if you ran 12

1317
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:42,319
campaigns in a year that

1318
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:46,880
you eliminated you know

1319
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:51,520
x amount of dollars and potential losses

1320
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:54,880
or you reduce risk by 50 percent

1321
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,880
yeah actually um

1322
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,839
i don't typically advocate for that

1323
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,200
application of the training results

1324
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:06,319
um as a protective measure um

1325
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:10,399
mainly because uh you know

1326
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:13,119
most security um

1327
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,839
the the risk is actually a zero or one

1328
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,599
right

1329
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,279
you know it's uh hey your company has

1330
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,160
existed another year you were secure

1331
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,319
enough

1332
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,520
good for you that kind of thing it's a

1333
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,880
it's a kind of uh

1334
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,040
yes or no especially for small

1335
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,240
businesses

1336
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,759
which is a large part of the the efforts

1337
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,399
and the work that our psychological

1338
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,680
security

1339
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:37,040
aims at the small mid-sized businesses

1340
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:41,040
the i would actually argue that

1341
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:43,599
taking the results of your your 12

1342
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,240
phishing campaigns is something that you

1343
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,000
can

1344
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,640
package in such a way that shows the

1345
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,400
results and it either buys transparency

1346
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,400
with your clients or your prospects it

1347
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,640
can help buy um

1348
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,760
you know opportunities to start a

1349
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,078
discussion

1350
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,440
and it actually becomes a great sales

1351
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,359
and prospecting tool

1352
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,440
for organizations of all different types

1353
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,200
whether they're you know accountants or

1354
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,559
manufacturers etc

1355
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,240
because um by bringing forward the

1356
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,280
results of your security awareness

1357
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,839
training

1358
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,640
uh you become a thought leader naturally

1359
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:17,680
in all these

1360
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,640
uh other industries so my argument is

1361
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,399
your kpi

1362
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:25,118
should be finding home

1363
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,680
within uh first your your revenue

1364
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,280
systems

1365
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,440
and then secondly your hr systems

1366
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,880
which are you can recruit better people

1367
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,839
because they know that they're coming to

1368
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,400
a culture

1369
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:38,160
that is going to take employee training

1370
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,760
seriously and it's a great bragging

1371
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,399
point when you're trying to recruit

1372
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,800
talent

1373
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,440
to your organization so that's usually

1374
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,839
where i

1375
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:49,359
i advocate for the application of kpis

1376
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:52,319
um but

1377
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,200
yeah i don't so i don't have the data on

1378
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:57,279
um

1379
00:48:53,200 --> 00:49:00,240
how to utilize kpis on you know uh

1380
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,839
proving that a loss did not occur um

1381
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,839
because of the trading
