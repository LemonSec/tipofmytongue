1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,849
welcome to digital resilience needs

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,799
supersede detect and protect my name is

3
00:00:09,849 --> 00:00:14,670
Kristen Kane I am the Senior Sales

4
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:17,410
Engineer at Red Seal for the southeast

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:22,060
in my career just a little bit about me

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:24,480
I have been I work for in network ops

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,830
and security ops I've worked for

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,410
value-added resellers and solution

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:32,738
providers and I work for manufacturers

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:35,649
so I have sat on all three sides of that

11
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:40,059
table sometimes all at once in the same

12
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:44,319
meeting so we all know that bad stuff

13
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:50,379
happens the list you see on the screen

14
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:51,839
are the list of state of reaches in the

15
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:55,809
last few years

16
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:58,358
John John Chambers stated that there are

17
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:00,968
two types of companies those have been

18
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,900
hacked and those who don't know they've

19
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:07,299
been had I compiled this list on the

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:11,380
screen with minimal research a few

21
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:13,840
minutes searching on Google and had to

22
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,119
truncate the list for lack of space on

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,100
the screen continue and I didn't

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,660
continue these are only data breach I

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:25,720
didn't include actual hacks like musk

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:30,039
panda mask or a ransomware attacks which

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,870
is you know Baltimore City Atlanta so we

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:37,090
all know that stuff happens we have we

29
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:38,620
have lots of evidence and and most of us

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:43,240
look at this list and go there but for

31
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:47,020
the grace of God go on that actors seem

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,850
to have the advantage one of my favorite

33
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,060
quotes or one of the resonates with me

34
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:54,550
on stage the favorable dark but comes

35
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,370
from Rob Joyce former chief of the

36
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,110
tailored access operations the National

37
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,210
Security Agency

38
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,010
you know the technologies you intended

39
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:05,199
to use in that network we know the

40
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:10,200
technologies that are actually when you

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:13,599
through the network the bottom line is

42
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,760
when we build networks a lot of times we

43
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,190
build them with a naive assumption that

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,720
they only

45
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:21,220
it's something we don't even if we're

46
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,620
smart enough to know that this is not

47
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,450
the truth sometimes we we are blind to

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:30,520
the fact that there are things going on

49
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:33,130
we just don't know about we on the other

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,700
hand most organizations operate under

51
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:39,549
detect and protect philosophy and and

52
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,670
this comes from the very nature of how

53
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,790
the market drives solutions for these

54
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,040
things they've their drive the market

55
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:51,519
inherently drives solutions to be point

56
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,470
solutions a problem I've got a problem

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,130
with viruses so we came up with anti

58
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,780
virus I have a problem with DDoS attacks

59
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,299
so we come up with solution for DDoS

60
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,220
attack I have a problem for this piece

61
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,580
of security security in the market

62
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,100
responds by creating a point solution

63
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,670
and and point solutions are going on

64
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,810
don't get me wrong point solutions are

65
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,940
excellent bring excellent value to the

66
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:20,200
network but they are inherently point

67
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:23,350
solutions and we and unfortunately the

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,420
reality is that we have more points that

69
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:29,410
need solutions then we can afford to

70
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:31,799
address and to top it off this affects

71
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:35,430
right through for detecting protect

72
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:38,410
means that we must succeed every time

73
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:43,300
and that's that's a an almost guaranteed

74
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:44,770
failure right there we have three

75
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,690
principal challenges we're going to talk

76
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,519
about today and then I at the end of the

77
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,870
presentation are the end of my slides

78
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:56,680
which are mercifully for you will I'll

79
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,390
take a look at some some solution acts

80
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,459
with some product driven solution

81
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:05,738
aspects we can things we can do with

82
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:07,720
certain solutions in the market first we

83
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:11,830
don't know our networks nearly as well

84
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,680
as we need to so think for yourself how

85
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:18,280
long would it take you to answer the

86
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,829
following question somebody comes to you

87
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:23,229
and says from within your organization

88
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,270
inside your paycheck and said you know

89
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:30,450
hey what's the attack surface of my

90
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:32,020
network look like hey are we exposed to

91
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,740
network Explorer

92
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:38,198
the RDP ports how many firewalls we have

93
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,180
an operation right now what procedures

94
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,940
and percentage of my servers are fully

95
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,610
patched hey there's a guess Wireless

96
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,740
thing that we have can they get any

97
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:52,990
place other than you know guess Wireless

98
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:55,150
I suspect that most of us would take

99
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,610
longer to answer some of those questions

100
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:01,388
than we might be comfortable with and

101
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:03,280
after answering we even might have some

102
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:07,120
lingering doubts about the accuracy the

103
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,539
answer if not today's answers and

104
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,919
tomorrow's you know certain to change

105
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:13,330
you know when I go to sleep at night and

106
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,240
I get up in the morning did the answer I

107
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,448
give yesterday's it's so right you know

108
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,729
how does it change how much is it change

109
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:24,130
and we all wonder you know that this is

110
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:25,810
something I have that keeps I'm fairly

111
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,120
certain we've all lost a little bit of

112
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:32,889
sleep or at least shed a few beads of

113
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:36,550
sweat over we did a survey red field a

114
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:40,599
survey of our customers CEOs and so this

115
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,849
kind of helps put this in perspective we

116
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:45,130
ask these a lot of questions but one of

117
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:46,960
them was how many of them believed they

118
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:51,099
had an accurate blueprints of their

119
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,810
network and they came back 76 percent of

120
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:54,310
CEOs believed they had an accurate

121
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,830
blueprint of the network infrastructure

122
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,710
so let's think about what that actually

123
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,880
means that means that either they have

124
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:05,409
already asked the question or been told

125
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,250
by the network team here's a picture of

126
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:11,289
our network it's accurate or they've

127
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,090
gone into their office you know wandered

128
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:14,409
down the hall and said hey show me a

129
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,460
picture of my network what's that look

130
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:20,710
like and got an answer that they have

131
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,529
taken if they saw you as you know

132
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,440
complete and total picture of their

133
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:28,680
network and we all know as soon as you

134
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,069
put pen to paper this network bastard

135
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,719
obsolete right now we're massive highly

136
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:38,169
influenced I you know which group

137
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:39,669
doesn't it we're now a firewall guys can

138
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,990
call different methods new router guy

139
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:43,448
rather guys going to draw a different

140
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,439
map than the the switch and

141
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,209
infrastructure guys access that

142
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,349
the cloud guys going to have a totally

143
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:53,169
different map that doesn't look anything

144
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:56,389
like anybody else's so it's a kind of

145
00:06:53,169 --> 00:07:00,128
interesting that the confidence of this

146
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:03,769
response was so high when we all know

147
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:04,459
that it's closer to this reality whit

148
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:05,899
Redfield

149
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:07,969
one of the things we do is create

150
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:11,269
network models from which we can project

151
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:15,019
a map and we find nearly a hundred

152
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:19,399
percent of the time that our customers

153
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:22,399
have devices subnets access that aren't

154
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:25,399
on anybody's playing anybody's

155
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,259
blueprints or been totally forgotten

156
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:33,079
about or Never we're known in the first

157
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:33,529
place we just don't know what we don't

158
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:40,009
know

159
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:42,889
i second week on the job at Red Seal I

160
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:44,749
went down to see your customer lovely

161
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,749
people and I was down there it was a

162
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:48,919
softball pitch right I was going in my

163
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:50,569
sales guy who'd been with the company

164
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,849
for a while so I don't worry about it

165
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,769
it'll be good to get your feet wet you

166
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:57,169
can do a road map thing talking to

167
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:59,149
customers see how we're doing maybe make

168
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:01,429
some suggestions about how it uses part

169
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:05,539
better so I go down and up we're doing

170
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:08,539
all this and it was great I had their

171
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:10,550
there Redfield brought a console up and

172
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,050
we're looking at it and scrolling

173
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,599
through a list of their firewalls and

174
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,469
when I'm stopped me and said hey Chris

175
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:20,539
whoa what's that I said well that's the

176
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:24,199
firewall looks like a Palo Alto firewall

177
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:26,269
model such as that named brought up I

178
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,019
read it off and he goes what what why is

179
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:29,269
that there

180
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:30,679
I said well it's there because Reza

181
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:32,659
would have gone out into the day

182
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:35,598
collection one of the things Red Steel

183
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:37,068
does is actually does a question on your

184
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,569
network devices and pulls in their

185
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:40,130
configurations and when we use those

186
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:44,689
configurations to build an as-built

187
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:46,189
model of an hour so I said well it's

188
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:47,809
right here here's the time stamp that

189
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:48,649
means that Reds you know last week

190
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:50,809
sometime

191
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:54,259
went out and did a data collection from

192
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:56,930
that device and Occident so it's on the

193
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:58,780
network and he goes no it's not and I

194
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,420
said well

195
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,069
yeah yeah it is because right there

196
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,420
there's the timestamp I'm show you where

197
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,590
we got you know I'm sure you that the

198
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:10,360
the session reference and everything you

199
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,300
guess well we decommission that firewall

200
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,280
six months ago and I said well you know

201
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,339
what it says you know Redfield said to

202
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,560
talk to it last week so he gets up

203
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,370
himself and goes out kind of smack about

204
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,260
ten minutes later

205
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,390
sometimes out there decommissioning

206
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:30,640
process that included unplugging the

207
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:33,250
upstream console the upstream patch

208
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,040
cable from the firewall but leaving all

209
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,120
of the downstream connection physical

210
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,010
connections through the firewall

211
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,630
implants and of course we all know why

212
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,270
they did this the firewall guys are

213
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,320
putting in new firewalls they wanted to

214
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,720
make sure if something went horribly

215
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,410
wrong they didn't have a whole lot of

216
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,530
work to do to go back to what was so

217
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:56,319
they just unplugged the outside you know

218
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:57,069
the public face that firewall and left

219
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,930
it as is

220
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,780
meaning to come back at some point and

221
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,989
take it offline and clean it up and it

222
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:07,150
never happened but in the meantime this

223
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:12,150
was providing access between the zones

224
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,150
on the the trusted side of the firewall

225
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,790
another example I went down to a

226
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:20,620
customer's you know proof of concept and

227
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,250
we've gotten certain elements whose

228
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,589
network modeled pulled in and he said

229
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,910
okay he's what's next and so well at

230
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:30,070
this point I like to kind of validate

231
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,930
that the network looks like you expect

232
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,700
it to look like and it you know we're

233
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,890
getting you know so it'll take some

234
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,290
throw me a softball well we'll check out

235
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,699
some easy stuff and kind of make an

236
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,060
assumption that you know most of it's

237
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,670
working

238
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,199
he says okay easy one he says I know

239
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,030
that this part of my network between

240
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,140
this permanent work and that part of my

241
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:53,589
network I only allow court eighty court

242
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:56,560
443 and 453 I said okay cool

243
00:10:53,589 --> 00:11:00,310
easy enough when we ran the query in

244
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,079
read tune and it comes back it should

245
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,989
have come back saying you know partially

246
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,200
open port 80 four four four three

247
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:12,400
quarter and it comes back to this right

248
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:15,190
open no controls no ACLs monitoring this

249
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,970
and he was like Oh Chris that's just not

250
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:21,520
right so he dug down on it a little bit

251
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:25,210
and at the end of the day we found a

252
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:29,470
full class c network in public IP space

253
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:33,370
so basically 255 addresses on the

254
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:36,460
internet that had any any access into

255
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:39,490
the courses network and he was blown

256
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,710
away and we're sitting there and he was

257
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:46,930
huge that can't be right that just can't

258
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:49,720
be oh I remember what that is I looked

259
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:54,219
at him and he took breath he said well a

260
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:57,640
while back we changed our phone over to

261
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:01,690
voice a cloud boy provider so it turns

262
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:04,449
out that this Class C Class C address

263
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,510
space on the internet was all I don't

264
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:10,600
buy the cloud voice provider board

265
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,340
provider and we've probably all been in

266
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,230
that room and know how that works the

267
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:19,480
guys came in giving them eating the all

268
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:22,110
credit they came in they locked

269
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,450
everything down they made the first call

270
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,050
didn't work now they're in their time

271
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,480
crunch

272
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,640
why is it not working I can't really

273
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,250
have my my president my vice president

274
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,050
my CEO not being able make phone calls

275
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,100
so what do they do they start ripping

276
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,430
out firewall rules

277
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:44,890
rip rip rip rip rip and they get down to

278
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:46,630
any any and finally works and they they

279
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,360
push back from the table and take a deep

280
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,350
breath and go great it works we're just

281
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,990
going to leave it right here for now

282
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:59,350
we'll come back and clean it up later of

283
00:12:52,990 --> 00:13:01,840
course they never did so we don't know

284
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,200
our networks as well as we should

285
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,940
because there's too much to know for any

286
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,360
one person to put in their head there's

287
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:14,800
too much to know second there mountains

288
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:17,490
of data and there are mountains of

289
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,829
products producing mountains of data

290
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:24,100
this slide is several years old just

291
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:26,110
kind of provoked shows the the landscape

292
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,940
of the security

293
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:31,630
software's social security solutions

294
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,820
thanks I'm sure that they're even bigger

295
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,070
I ordered magnitude now and and they're

296
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,220
probably ones that as many of them

297
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:41,649
falling off or many new ones meaning the

298
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:45,430
falling off those are our new ones

299
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:46,930
a recent study you know the minimum

300
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,300
number of security solutions and

301
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,420
enterprises is a dozen large

302
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:55,420
infrastructures can have forty or fifty

303
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:58,180
I run into our regular basis customers

304
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,250
going yeah my budgets been slashed I've

305
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,810
got a I've got to figure out what tools

306
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,450
I'm going to keep what tools let me get

307
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,079
rid of so you know we're always on the

308
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,680
chopping block

309
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:10,329
from my side and of course from the

310
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,569
operational side they're always having

311
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:15,430
to pick and choose which baby they want

312
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:19,839
to keep and which baby they throw out

313
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:21,489
into the bulrushes and on top of

314
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,170
everything else most of these are again

315
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,089
point solutions and they don't really

316
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:32,740
provide any sort of integrated or

317
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:34,720
holistic view of the the situation and

318
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,380
in third we never have enough network

319
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,440
with security may Mountaineers we get

320
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,670
tons of sack we have tons of data but we

321
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,790
don't have enough people to do the

322
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,519
analysis you know what do we do we hire

323
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,230
people but they don't exist we use fewer

324
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,149
products

325
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,430
orderly in vacant more an existing tech

326
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:57,640
now my brother-in-law as a cyber

327
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,680
security expert and works for credit

328
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,709
union in the southeast has risen the

329
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,569
organization to the point where he now

330
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:07,719
oversees hiring his own team

331
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:10,990
cybersecurity team he literally cannot

332
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,430
find qualified staff has ultimately

333
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,870
decided that the best way to get

334
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:18,459
qualified staff to actually grow them

335
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:22,290
himself so he's got to find people are

336
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:25,329
interested cultivate them train them

337
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,610
hope that HR doesn't undermine his

338
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:31,359
ability to pay them at the market rate

339
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:33,000
and retain them and when he can't do

340
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,100
that he has start all over again

341
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,540
he barely in his complaining we talk

342
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,980
about this on a regular basis for deaf

343
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,079
family gatherings

344
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,940
even the

345
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:47,070
it's just hard to keep ahead it's hard

346
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:49,680
to say even much let's get ahead bonus

347
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:52,860
material and then we have organizational

348
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,969
challenges you know our own

349
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,620
organizations work against this you know

350
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,330
we have SEC ops and then arts and

351
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,720
separate branches reporting to different

352
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:06,720
VPS with conflicting you know a

353
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,990
competing budget we have the Nama jobs I

354
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,820
want to help but I've been told not to

355
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:18,450
territorial battles zero-sum budget

356
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:21,600
games so what do we do we need to shift

357
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:24,230
our way of thinking protection detection

358
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,490
are necessary but no longer sufficient

359
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,710
we need to incorporate the idea of

360
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:32,430
digital resistance you are our planning

361
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:34,830
and our organizational bill we assume

362
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,829
the after same digital regimes as soon

363
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,480
as attacks happen and succeed just as

364
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,190
soon as I step from the get-go it's

365
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,860
going to happen it's already happened

366
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:47,490
it's already been successful how do we

367
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:50,550
mitigate the damage and the impact of

368
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:53,010
those attacks we focus on continual

369
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,729
insight or improvement and we focus on

370
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,730
rapid recover

371
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:02,130
digital resilient help speaker in from

372
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,500
the top down certainly can only be

373
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,449
successful ultimately successful fully

374
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,339
successful we're driven from the top

375
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,650
down but it's actually implemented from

376
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,260
the bottom up because the mechanics of

377
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:17,400
digital resilience are built at the

378
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,800
operational level it also helps to build

379
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,290
organizations and incentivize a holistic

380
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,609
view and I apologize for the jargon it's

381
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,920
just sometimes they just can't get

382
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:29,159
around it a holistic view and they work

383
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,440
security and performance we build think

384
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,710
about how we build naively build

385
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,100
organization those of us on the on the

386
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:40,440
call we decided to get busy we get

387
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,409
together and we build company and say

388
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,950
none of us for safer discussion is a

389
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,780
network the IT security person but we

390
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,670
know that we need networks and we know

391
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,080
we need IT security and we know we need

392
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,910
some of these things so what do we do

393
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,530
well you know one of us

394
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,300
we need firewalls so we go hire a

395
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,379
firewall that one of us is hard we need

396
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:05,700
routers we about go ahead a rather that

397
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:07,560
one of us is hard we need so we've got

398
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,910
some regulatory requirements we got so

399
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:12,000
we go hire a team a regulatory

400
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:14,190
requirement people and what have we done

401
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,660
inherently we had built a siloed

402
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:20,160
infrastructure and how do businesses

403
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,800
typically run well whatever we've got

404
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,540
one budget if I get to chunk of it so

405
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,879
now we've built all these silos that we

406
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:30,629
have to budget out and those budgets are

407
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,250
inherently competing with each other so

408
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,770
before we know it before we've actually

409
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:38,940
taken any active steps we've actually

410
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:41,040
created an organization that is built

411
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,390
from the ground up not to cooperate with

412
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,710
each other and that's a problem

413
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,480
unfortunately it's about a heart can say

414
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,010
about you know organization than just

415
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,150
that it's definitely something we need

416
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:57,180
to focus on or or pay attention to

417
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:59,970
because the innate assumptions that we

418
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:03,540
build organizations with and have very

419
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,280
real-world impacts but what I really

420
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,980
like to focus on for the rest of talking

421
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,330
is the tools and the nature of those

422
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,940
tools that we we use when we build out

423
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,889
the security organization so we want to

424
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:22,200
adopt tools that help you know your

425
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:24,720
network we need to you know however that

426
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,250
works right you need to know you never

427
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,770
even know about your network they need

428
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:31,470
to be able to assess the inventory you

429
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,940
need to be able to know the context and

430
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,980
then work how those those immature

431
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,830
pieces put together how they speak to

432
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,590
one another what face what surface they

433
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:44,820
present to the world where the weak

434
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:48,899
points are where things are vulnerable

435
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,189
to attack we need to provide we need

436
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,730
tools that can help provide these

437
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:57,750
insight across functional groups across

438
00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:00,960
silos we need to find tools that

439
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:06,620
inherently encourage sharing of

440
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,620
information so

441
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm just a second I'm going to switch

442
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,480
over screens here so for example in Red

443
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,030
Seal

444
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:25,140
one of the first things we do is pull in

445
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:28,560
configurations from devices when we pull

446
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,210
into devices we run best practice check

447
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,950
run them through best practice chance

448
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:37,250
and we provide these you know as a like

449
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:40,410
a first level of value that we get in

450
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:42,720
these are industry standard best

451
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,400
practice gents generally agreed on if

452
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,600
you look at me I don't make sense you

453
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,930
know I shouldn't have a default password

454
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,350
I should have a password on an able

455
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,780
account

456
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:57,169
I shouldn't have telnet turned on and

457
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:57,170
the device that sort of thing with these

458
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,940
with these best practice checks you can

459
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,490
do a couple things you first you take a

460
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:09,120
look and kind of sort and see where you

461
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:12,900
are actually following best practices

462
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,820
and where there are outliers so this

463
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,070
raises questions hey I've got a question

464
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,200
for the network guys you know I've got

465
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:23,700
to I mean I get a best practice check

466
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,370
I've got 211 devices total two and nine

467
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,710
of them pass but I've got two hours to

468
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,629
fail so clearly we're following that

469
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,720
policy we're following it as practice

470
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:37,080
check but why do I have two outlines are

471
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,960
those special cases are those dukes and

472
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,080
you take that now the interesting thing

473
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,390
with red seal is that we typically

474
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,060
typically end up selling to the security

475
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,650
group because or the compliance group of

476
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:53,850
the audit group or someone on the

477
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:56,910
security side of the table and but this

478
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:59,429
is clearly a network ops challenge right

479
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:02,190
we have our security now these are

480
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,290
security teams about redfield take this

481
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,900
information and have to communicate I

482
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,250
work with and there were costing what's

483
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,570
the problem with security and there were

484
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,270
cops working together well they're

485
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:16,260
incentivized totally and totally

486
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:19,690
opposite ways now where guys are hired

487
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,820
and paid to make bits ago security

488
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,240
people are hired and paid to make it

489
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,220
stop so it is often difficult and

490
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,639
challenge to get these teams to work

491
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,769
together we actually spend a lot of time

492
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:35,908
and a tread feel when I'm not coaching

493
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:39,879
our security users and how to talk to

494
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:44,860
the network path and network folks so

495
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:47,830
that they can offer these up as

496
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,590
conversation starters and not rocks to

497
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:54,460
beat them with the last thing we want is

498
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:56,019
these folks to walk in and clam a record

499
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,299
down on the desk and say hey you got

500
00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:00,000
scraps fixing your network because that

501
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:04,779
doesn't set in make any friends right

502
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:09,580
much better to approach that with beer

503
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:12,250
candy or both and make it a soft a soft

504
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,230
question hey tell me about this how did

505
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:17,350
you guys do this why did you guys do

506
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:20,679
this why is this he did another way to

507
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:25,110
look at these is exactly the opposite

508
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:28,240
look where and you see I'm sorted here

509
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:30,219
turn on my highlighter I've sorted here

510
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,129
where you can see I've got zero pass

511
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,350
devices and all my fail devices so the

512
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:36,939
question there is why are we not paying

513
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,980
any attention at all through this best

514
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,809
practice check again this is a

515
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,899
conversation so nod it done by the

516
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:46,899
security side but if the conversations

517
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:51,629
definitely going to end at the network

518
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:54,908
offset and this is where that building

519
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:57,519
organizations that work welcome the

520
00:23:54,909 --> 00:24:01,000
communication across silos and realizes

521
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:03,220
the ultimate goal is not only making the

522
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,289
bits fast as fast as possible or only

523
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:08,679
locking everything down so nothing bad

524
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:12,190
happen but working together so that we

525
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:15,850
have a effective and secure organization

526
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:20,159
is key and tools like this can help

527
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:20,158
encourage that when used properly

528
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:27,239
another example is the

529
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:34,710
risk so we take along with the we

530
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,719
pullian configurations from the network

531
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:40,400
devices and we build a model of the

532
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,240
network as it is built we also pull in

533
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,240
vulnerability data currently aboard

534
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,600
older scanner and present two different

535
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:53,070
ways to look at that vulnerability data

536
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:57,590
so this is a picture visual picture of a

537
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,590
typical home ability scan sorted by

538
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:06,420
presented by CBS escort okay this is

539
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:08,760
what you usually get you know reds of

540
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,740
high CVS escorts green jello CBS s

541
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,540
scores and as you can see there's not

542
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,100
really anything that jumps out the red

543
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,720
certainly stands out but it doesn't

544
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,699
really suggest where to start but the

545
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:24,780
red and this is a fairly small Network

546
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:29,550
four pieces Redfield can take and sort

547
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:31,649
this and actually because we put the

548
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,530
risk these low mobility scores in the

549
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:37,020
context of a network we can see who are

550
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,010
given host with given vulnerability can

551
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,129
it be reached

552
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:44,000
what else can it reach a network and

553
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:47,160
create a score that suggests that

554
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,710
indicates where a single host or single

555
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,970
group of hosts have inordinate amounts

556
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:53,100
of access to the rest of the network

557
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,620
where they're also hosts with risk and

558
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,370
then and we can point to those so in

559
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:03,120
this case we have one that pops up right

560
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:05,550
here we call downstream risk would

561
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,679
suggest that basically if I were to

562
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,510
patch that one host I would get rid of a

563
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,360
huge amount of risk in my network

564
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:16,530
I'd be closing a door that had hallways

565
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:19,679
off of it to other a lot of other hosts

566
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:21,000
that could also be active so this is the

567
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:26,820
kind of thing again you want to use

568
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,190
tools and look at tools that help you do

569
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:32,250
deep insight and analytics in your

570
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:35,220
network and see very quickly where do I

571
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:37,500
spend my resources which are rare we've

572
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,800
already talked about that how do i best

573
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:46,710
use these things have my best cream

574
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:48,690
eight complete strategies that are not

575
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,580
just host focus you're not just Network

576
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:54,330
focus you're not just perimeter focus

577
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:57,149
but incorporate elements of all of us so

578
00:26:54,330 --> 00:27:06,510
that you know you make good decisions

579
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:08,840
make smart decision hop back over to my

580
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,840
slides

581
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:25,629
actually I believe that was that so I'll

582
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,629
stop there any questions
