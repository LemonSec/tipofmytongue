00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,959
come last year you've both Matt and Eric

17
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,960
work with Michael Bryant over at secure

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,150
once here works has been one of our

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,190
sponsors from from day one we really

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,320
appreciate all the work that they do

21
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:13,810
especially you Michael and support of

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,639
not only piece ice cream though but

23
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,560
besides everywhere he's always the first

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,680
first person to be there for everyone

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,840
and so that's just brings a lot of

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,840
amazing opportunities so a lot of people

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:31,700
and so Eric came last year when we were

28
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:35,090
at the Clemson International Center for

29
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,729
Automotive Research or at I car and ran

30
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:41,240
our Wi-Fi security workshop which

31
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:44,929
everyone had a blast with and had really

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:48,890
had a great time learned a lot Eric is

33
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:52,399
is definitely by far one of the top

34
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:54,770
Wi-Fi guys in the world I really

35
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,789
appreciate him take you the time to come

36
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,399
share with the group

37
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:00,499
I think Eric only has X amount of black

38
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,700
badges from Def Con how many do you have

39
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:05,630
in your collection

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,640
oh I have one hour tony has won several

41
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,288
but yeah I only have one personally I

42
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:18,440
thought was that would feel bad to have

43
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:19,970
multiple of those one and done so so

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,660
again I really appreciate both of you

45
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,760
two for coming to share with a group and

46
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,910
so with that I will turn it over which

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,040
one of you needs to share your screen

48
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,010
that will be me so let's see things

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,450
figure out how to do this

50
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,429
[Music]

51
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:42,039
right

52
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,039
[Music]

53
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,970
let's see it is going to be

54
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,980
you

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,569
um all right view in full-screen mode

56
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,579
my mission is somewhere oh there we go

57
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:15,069
perfect I guess had to be the what's it

58
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:16,840
called the presenter yeah I guess I

59
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:20,108
missed it was gonna be you questions

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,659
gonna be you and then yeah we can see

61
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:24,849
your screen perfectly so uh we get out

62
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:27,149
of the way and thank you again both and

63
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:31,738
yeah absolutely

64
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,739
let's see let's make this screen

65
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,650
you

66
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,940
all right you guys do that okay in the

67
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:53,640
fullscreen

68
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:55,200
perfect awesome cool alright so like

69
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,500
Michael sayin my name is Erik Escobar

70
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,350
and man those are those are way too kind

71
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,700
of words I do not think that highly of

72
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,609
myself but I appreciate that

73
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,200
and then Matt form is also here on the

74
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,660
line he's a good friend of mine we both

75
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,760
worked at secure works we came from

76
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,460
Barracuda and we live not that far away

77
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,890
from each other so we do a lot more than

78
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,610
just than just computer things so Matt I

79
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:22,130
don't know if you want to introduce

80
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:24,570
yourself you have a principal consultant

81
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:27,690
with the adversarial group here at

82
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:30,740
secure works been doing this the

83
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:35,390
security thing for almost 10 years now

84
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,390
Wireless is fun and it's everywhere

85
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,330
absolutely and I think I'd like to kind

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,850
of just point out that our talk is going

87
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,190
to be you know kind of in the direction

88
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,660
of wireless and Wi-Fi always seem to be

89
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,960
kind of that redheaded stepchild for a

90
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:52,120
pen test when in reality you know

91
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,219
Wireless is almost everywhere there you

92
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,450
know almost every corporation government

93
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,730
out there has some kind of wireless

94
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,400
network and really that's just an

95
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,780
extension of your internal network but

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,580
it's out there for everybody to see

97
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,340
and so our talk is kind of going to

98
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,750
delve into you know what that looks like

99
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,489
what that means for your company and

100
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,800
some of the things that you know an

101
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,130
adversary can look at and see without

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,690
you know without you even realizing so

103
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:20,950
without further ado let's see if I can

104
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:24,730
click through this so this started out a

105
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,710
while ago with you know my idea of hey I

106
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,030
have a two-year-old at home and I don't

107
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,469
want to travel and do wireless pen

108
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,349
testing so I'm gonna try and figure out

109
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,840
a better way you know to have a platform

110
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,850
that we can test remotely from and to

111
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,099
have like basically a smaller device

112
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,890
that's fairly inexpensive that we can

113
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,930
keep on a person so we don't ever have

114
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,490
to really worry about you know is you

115
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,500
know is your Wi-Fi up-to-date you're

116
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,360
trying to pass your you know your

117
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,300
wireless cards through a VM or anything

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,919
like that and so this is my very first

119
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,390
iteration from a bunch of years ago and

120
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,120
basically just Raspberry Pi with a

121
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,520
battery pack and a single 2.4 gigahertz

122
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,680
tp-link adapter um the whole goal of

123
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,960
this was basically just to keep it you

124
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,630
know just just keep this in my pocket

125
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,510
and then I was able to control it you

126
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:13,060
know via hotspot and an SSH client as

127
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,099
you can see so any of you guys out there

128
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,250
are familiar with air dumps this should

129
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,140
be a very familiar screen basically this

130
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:23,470
is just what I can see on my phone it is

131
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,599
you know I'm screened into an error dump

132
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,070
session so I can monitor all the

133
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,500
wireless traffic around me just for my

134
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,700
phone and the obvious advantages of that

135
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,680
are that if you've ever been on a

136
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,080
wireless pen test and you come walking

137
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,400
down the hallway and your laptop looks

138
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,710
like a porcupine because of all the

139
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,349
antennas coming out of it any any

140
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,419
adversary any you know person trying to

141
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,800
do something dastardly is gonna see you

142
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:47,500
coming from a mile away and they're

143
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,700
going to know to you

144
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
they're gonna know to like turn off

145
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,750
whatever they're broadcasting or you

146
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,070
know close out of any screen you're

147
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,990
going to be super obvious and so this

148
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,190
this device is basically meant to

149
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,320
dissuade that and it's kind of born out

150
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:02,200
of the wireless capture-the-flag when

151
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,870
you're chasing foxes which are basically

152
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,280
just people that have people that have

153
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,900
like an access point in their pocket

154
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,849
right and so if you're trying to chase

155
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,500
them down and they can see you come in

156
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,210
they're going to run away from you so

157
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,800
it's kind of twofold one for the

158
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,280
wireless capture the flag but then also

159
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,510
for just clients in general it proved to

160
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,380
be really useful Matt I don't know if

161
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:24,250
you want to add anything to that

162
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,630
oh yeah just generally right here if

163
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,640
you're walking around you got like a

164
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,560
backpack on your hands are free get your

165
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,240
mobile device out I mean just kind of

166
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,860
blend right in like Eric was saying the

167
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,500
other the other feature that too when

168
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,290
you're not walking with one hand as

169
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,350
laptop tray other hand as keyboard

170
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,640
navigator I find my situational

171
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,610
awareness is a little better a little

172
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,430
bit more aware of sort of the

173
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,210
environment that I'm in doing Wireless

174
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,240
when you're trying to man in the middle

175
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,859
clients right that sometimes that

176
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,620
awareness is really sort of your most

177
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,260
important tool all right good good air

178
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,440
of them for you know whatever men in the

179
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,490
middle framework tools you like using

180
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,110
running you don't you don't really need

181
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:09,340
to keep eyes on that 24/7 so the fact

182
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,370
that you can just sort of switch back to

183
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,869
phone modem look around keeping that

184
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,580
this a terminal open on your phone

185
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:19,979
without having to have your laptop out

186
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,979
is just a the wind all the way around

187
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,590
yeah and the other thing that's also

188
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,050
really nice about it that but maybe

189
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,450
we'll talk about going forward is since

190
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,490
since the raspberry PI's in font home to

191
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,679
our you know to our c2 to our Penn lab

192
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,880
infrastructure any one of our other

193
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,919
consultants that SecureWorks

194
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,780
can look at my st. you know they can hop

195
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,760
into that same screen session you know

196
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,949
from their keyboard and mouse with three

197
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,200
screens and they can you know they can

198
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,400
say go back look at this look at that so

199
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,570
that is that is definitely other

200
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,790
powerful pieces that you can have

201
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,050
basically a remotely operated person

202
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,180
that's going to walk around get your

203
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,500
coverage and somebody else watch so

204
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,040
that's kind of a cool piece of it as

205
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,790
well keep clicking so this is mass spec

206
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,870
I can't let them tell you about that

207
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,760
yeah so you can see there's a bunch of

208
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:09,200
bunch of nefarious looking stuff on the

209
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:11,810
outside there's a ninety be also omni um

210
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:17,150
on that right-hand picture than a panel

211
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:21,170
alpha the little adapter there is just a

212
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:24,079
regular alpha 2.4 gigahertz they come in

213
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,479
those sort of bulbous cases and they're

214
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,870
like you know highlighter yellow or

215
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,640
whatever called her stupid Geller so

216
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,920
you'll see in a couple pictures further

217
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,840
into the slide we built this appliance

218
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,930
where we step a whole bunch of hardware

219
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,970
into a gun case basically one of the

220
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,760
things we needed to do was was really

221
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,200
sort of put a premium on space for that

222
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,710
so you can see that's just like a little

223
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,630
custom 3d printed adapter Oh slides went

224
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,660
forward and then never fails yeah and

225
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,400
just kind of toggle back and forth so

226
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,959
you can see on on the left there's gray

227
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,230
on the right there's a blue I have a

228
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,330
couple different USB adapters just sort

229
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,340
of stuck to the outside of the backpack

230
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,770
and then can you hop one for there you

231
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,050
yeah and then inside the back leg you

232
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:11,329
can see is just a couple of pies and

233
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,120
again pretty printed just some cases

234
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:18,340
that hold the a core 10k no and our

235
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:22,190
battery which is an astral power both a

236
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:25,040
PI and two USB NICs for the better part

237
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,930
of eight hours so I'm literally walking

238
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,640
around right it's the the tactical

239
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,920
backpack which whatever is kind of kind

240
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,600
of a stupid move on my part um but I

241
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,120
think we were actually doing some big

242
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,850
external

243
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,940
environment that day but you can see

244
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,670
instead of having you know a whole bunch

245
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,190
of kit hanging hanging off and like

246
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:50,780
antennas and my hands tied up with

247
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:52,940
laptops and radios or whatever I'm

248
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:56,390
literally just a backpack and a dude

249
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:00,140
dressed relatively corporate blending in

250
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,910
blending into the noise right so it's

251
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,580
just kind of kind of the same thing like

252
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:07,610
a lot of little incremental improvements

253
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:10,970
to wireless testing basically led us to

254
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,110
this place where we can do a bunch of

255
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:16,070
wireless stuff that people just aren't

256
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:18,170
really doing and one thing to that like

257
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,950
so so Matt's head sonic for a second and

258
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:25,339
this engagement was us walking through a

259
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:29,330
very heavily crowded theme park for

260
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,950
about a week and no one and no one you

261
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,110
know knew any of the wiser they didn't

262
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:34,370
realize that we were catching

263
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,140
credentials you know from a fortune

264
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,850
giant companies you know they had no

265
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,830
idea that you know we just looked like

266
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,750
any other part gas park attendant with a

267
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,800
backpack you know maybe slightly better

268
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,540
dressed I may still have falafel on but

269
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,400
but what what does it gives you is it

270
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,110
gives you the ability to just kind of

271
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,280
blend in which when people think of

272
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,350
wireless pen test they think of

273
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,790
pineapples they think of you know

274
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,530
antennas and all these things you know

275
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,870
all this like really all guys grabbed on

276
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:05,060
every year with the craziest thing I've

277
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:06,830
ever the hectic though I forget what his

278
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,400
name is but yeah the tech spy

279
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,500
yeah yeah maybe ask me anyway

280
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,770
the other so the other powerful piece of

281
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,960
this is that when when we do a wireless

282
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,090
pen test you know a lot of the times you

283
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,860
will just think of internal/external pen

284
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:24,230
test your internal pen test is typically

285
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,540
you know you're simulating an adversary

286
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,040
on your internal network whether that's

287
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,020
from you know one of your end users

288
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,120
clicking on some malicious email or

289
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,829
phishing link you know whether you have

290
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,410
a rogue employee that wants to do some

291
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,150
harm or you know some someone breaches

292
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,339
your physical security and implanted

293
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:42,260
device you know those are kind of the

294
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,600
the things that an internal pen testing

295
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,980
device and an external pentoses is you

296
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,940
know gal fits into that it's somebody on

297
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,790
the public internet try

298
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,700
you know hop on your VPN trying to you

299
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,530
know pop your Outlook Web Access or any

300
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,420
other like Citrix or any other you know

301
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,280
stuff that's that's on your public

302
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,469
facing internet existence but the thing

303
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,600
that many people don't really even think

304
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,070
about it really and care about is their

305
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,470
their wireless security and what Wi-Fi

306
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,060
networks they're putting out there

307
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,650
because when you look at it you know you

308
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,270
think of any other building you know so

309
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,380
this is just some stock image of like

310
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,720
some stock building but it's not

311
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,090
dissimilar for many of our clients you

312
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,940
know and and I could very easily just

313
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:21,350
sit on a park bench and point you know

314
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,780
directional antenna or sometimes just

315
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,460
just have my omni antenna and pick up

316
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,870
wireless signal and if I'm able to

317
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,720
compromise that or compromised

318
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,550
credentials I'm able to then hop on that

319
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,250
network and I am on your internal

320
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:39,800
network without any real logs or any

321
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:42,170
real you know I guess suspicion that

322
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,180
something had happened right and and

323
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,010
kind of going with that what ends up

324
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,500
happening in the scenario is that more

325
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,420
often than not on a wireless pen test we

326
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,010
are you know thrown onto an internal

327
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,280
network once we once we've compromised

328
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,780
it and it's very few steps to a normal

329
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,030
internal pen test which you know

330
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,680
typically a domain admin bring it down

331
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,250
quickly I don't know if you want to add

332
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:08,810
anything to that

333
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:11,360
oh no I mean I think it's worse exact

334
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:14,180
reference to the point you made earlier

335
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,670
about when we show up to do a wireless

336
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:19,489
pen test you know since we have this

337
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:23,390
sort of remote device capabilities to do

338
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:27,290
remote wireless you really do instead of

339
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:29,390
having sort of one consultant sort of in

340
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,790
a bubble on site doing doing this work

341
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:35,210
for you you really sort of do open the

342
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:38,630
door to the whole the whole stable of of

343
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:40,490
our team right so somebody gets on right

344
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,170
Eric is able to compromise an account

345
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,320
wind up with Active Directory

346
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:48,170
credentials is accessing you know some

347
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,320
segmented part of the wireless network

348
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,849
finds a web app pulls in it somebody

349
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,620
from our team who specializes in web

350
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,720
apps all the time 24/7 that's what

351
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,600
they're doing so Eric is able to then

352
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,570
set up a proxy you get to get how one of

353
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,700
our what

354
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,530
bad ninjas working on a web app over

355
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,230
wireless and you sort of start to see

356
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,630
how this full-spectrum kind of test

357
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:12,930
unfolds right we came on wireless was

358
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:15,870
the point in but you really wind up with

359
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,569
with a full security exercise of your

360
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,940
internal network out of it yeah yeah

361
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,920
exactly and then yeah we'll cover some

362
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,490
of the other ways that that external

363
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,459
pentest

364
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,140
help kind of like our internal and and

365
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,680
wireless and how that works too let's

366
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:32,970
see what else we got here um so this is

367
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,400
this is one of the tool that we use is

368
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,680
called Wi-Fi Fisher so at the end of the

369
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,060
day a lot of wireless testing is really

370
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,849
you know it's like most things and some

371
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,589
key stage in computer security that in

372
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,270
general computers are secure it's the

373
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,460
people that are you know your your

374
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:49,560
greatest weakness and so this screen

375
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,630
basically what what it does is it's a

376
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,859
tool that stands up a rogue access point

377
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,390
and if you're not familiar with what a

378
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,310
rogue access point is it's basically

379
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,410
just just a wireless hotspot it's a

380
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,180
wireless network that that shouldn't be

381
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,650
there so the only difference between a

382
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,060
rogue access point normal access point

383
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,530
is that one shouldn't be there and one

384
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,359
should ones trying to do nefarious

385
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,069
things the other one is just you know

386
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,850
giving you access to corporate resources

387
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,750
or you know just just internet resources

388
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,640
and so when you kind of look at the

389
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,580
screen you see oh well I'm just saying

390
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,920
that's an access point and it will try

391
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,060
and do authenticate somebody from from

392
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,380
the network that they're connected to

393
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,300
the one that you're targeting and so in

394
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,040
this case you know that will just pick

395
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,040
them off with the hope that oh maybe

396
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,050
they'll rejoin your wireless and so you

397
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,640
can see what happens here is that when

398
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,189
we kicked them off of their wireless

399
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,110
they then join our wireless network and

400
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,880
when they join our wireless network we

401
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,440
will serve them up a page that looks

402
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,030
like this and so if anybody's seen

403
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,980
something similar that says it is the

404
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,720
captive portal page but really we

405
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,340
crafted this entire page all right when

406
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,290
I say we does application crafted this

407
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,270
entire page so there's no internet

408
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,709
connection and this you know where it's

409
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,380
prompting for that network security key

410
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,300
this is actually just you know HTML form

411
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,360
that somebody's filling out but it you

412
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,560
know it uses a user agent from their

413
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,870
device you know and so if you were to

414
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,609
connect to this you know using an iPhone

415
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,500
it would pop up a safari you know

416
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,729
captive portal page if you were to

417
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,369
connect it from an Android phone it

418
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,750
would pop up you know whatever that user

419
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:14,310
agent was specify so it's kind of

420
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,310
customized automatically on the

421
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,690
why to be able to make the determination

422
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,490
of like hey what are we going to serve

423
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,230
them up and the idea being that you know

424
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,250
an astute computer user may look at this

425
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,700
and be like oh no this looks kind of

426
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:28,740
sammy but 95% of other computer users

427
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,940
they're gonna say oh i must not have you

428
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,300
know the wireless password typed in

429
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,040
correctly

430
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,830
well if i must be doing something kind

431
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,450
of wonky or weird and so when they hit

432
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,949
next they're basically just submitting a

433
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,660
form of a clear text password so you

434
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,910
could have a 30 character fully

435
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,700
randomized password passphrase whatever

436
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,930
that may be and and that end user is

437
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,270
just basically being tricked into

438
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:49,770
submitting it to you in clear text and

439
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,980
that's why it's called Wi-Fi Fisher

440
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,540
because it is you know a normal fishing

441
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,900
you know exercise only done in the

442
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,670
wireless realm and yeah I mean this is

443
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,290
this is a very similar way to how we get

444
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,960
stolen credentials how we compromise

445
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,030
workstations if you really wanted to and

446
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,220
you were looking for a way to exfil data

447
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,750
you know to steal large amounts of

448
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,810
corporate data you could exfiltrate it

449
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,980
in this way and and the other part of

450
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,620
this too which i think is really funny

451
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,840
is that a lot of times end users will

452
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,659
use you know their own hotspots their

453
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,820
own you know access points so let's take

454
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,650
insert you know circumvent the corporate

455
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,879
policies you know maybe corporate policy

456
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,640
doesn't allow you to watch a Netflix on

457
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,950
your you know on your laptop but if you

458
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,590
you know if an end-user pulls up their

459
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,900
hotspot you know then they can use that

460
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,399
and so that works in our favor a lot of

461
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,050
times because corporate policies might

462
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,400
keep us out but if somebody's doing

463
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,930
something to get you know actively

464
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,170
against it something that we can always

465
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:48,410
exploit as an adversary I don't know

466
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:54,990
Matt if you want to add anything to that

467
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:57,000
nah oh sweet umm yeah so the next part

468
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,260
of that is if there's always a ton of a

469
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,360
ton of information I don't think people

470
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,190
realize is out there when when you know

471
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,260
Wireless is just broadcasting typically

472
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,850
people are just familiar with wireless

473
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,870
access points when you know they look at

474
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,219
their phone and they see what's around

475
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,830
and you know they're trying out it

476
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,620
connects a guess network but really most

477
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,090
people are most used to seeing Wireless

478
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,219
from the form of just what does your

479
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,010
phone say and really there's a lot more

480
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,400
information that that is being beaconed

481
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,140
out that's being emitted out wirelessly

482
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,480
that gives off a lot more data than you

483
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,230
would think and so we'll take a quick

484
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,270
brief look at the

485
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:32,400
so if you look this is that screen that

486
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,440
we are looking at before the tool called

487
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,140
arrow dum era done basically just just

488
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,820
shows in a nice a nice way I mean this

489
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,140
may not like look nice to you if you're

490
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,629
not used to looking at it but I'm

491
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,179
compared to looking at like raw packets

492
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,070
in Wireshark this this is a really great

493
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,169
representation of all the wireless

494
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,340
networks that are out there so if you

495
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:52,230
look on the left hand column there's a

496
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,639
column called the SSID that's a MAC

497
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,710
address that's like you think of like a

498
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,600
serial number for a wireless hardware

499
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,340
device and that typically doesn't change

500
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,049
and you look on the far right-hand side

501
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,879
and there's something called EFS ID

502
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:05,070
that's your network name that's that's

503
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,309
what you normally see on your phone and

504
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,629
why that matters is that you can see all

505
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:11,399
this information is just publicly

506
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,770
available you know it's not encrypted

507
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,840
it's not you know any any end-user any

508
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,780
person that's just sniffing Wi-Fi can

509
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,399
see all this information password or not

510
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:23,370
and what you can see here is that there

511
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,650
is this this hardware device is

512
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:28,649
connected to this access point and why

513
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:30,240
that matters is because every MAC

514
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,309
address manufacturer or every

515
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,169
manufacturer of hardware you know

516
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,240
registers what they're you know what

517
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:37,950
their subset of their serial number

518
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,450
looks like so you can take a look at

519
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,669
that you know when I get you remember

520
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:44,309
I'm really just using a dum-dum version

521
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:46,620
of what a MAC address is but you can see

522
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:49,980
that this device is actually a mess you

523
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,830
know an S device and so without without

524
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,809
knowing anything about this network or

525
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,879
whatever it is I know that hey maybe

526
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:59,280
this is an IOT network because it has an

527
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,620
S device on it or maybe you know an S

528
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,360
device is allowed on their corporate you

529
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,129
know network whatever that may be this

530
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,918
gives you insight as an attacker that

531
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,390
you didn't need to exploit anything to

532
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,080
do you didn't need to transmit a single

533
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,220
packet to see this it gives you you know

534
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,649
basically just a wealth of information

535
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,900
of hey is this a predominantly Apple

536
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:21,330
user shop you know do they have a bunch

537
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,549
of iPhones on this network or do they

538
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,080
have a bunch of you know Intel chips for

539
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:25,650
maybe their corporate laptops on this

540
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,110
network

541
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:30,929
so without seeing anything you you can

542
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,580
divine some information which is pretty

543
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:34,770
darn well and then the other part of

544
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:38,280
that too is that you can also use this

545
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:40,260
to track users because with with

546
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,668
wireless and with Wi-Fi you can look at

547
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,070
signal strength and so if you have a

548
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:44,470
couple

549
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,700
points you know you can know everybody's

550
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,070
used to looking at their phone and seen

551
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,980
signal bars of Wi-Fi or just you know

552
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,620
LTE and so you can tell hey how close am

553
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:57,220
i did this user to this device and why

554
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:59,860
that matters is that you know you can

555
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,320
track a device or a user or a access

556
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,540
point even if it's moving around and so

557
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,429
you can even do this through tools like

558
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,230
blue sonar which basically does the same

559
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,030
exact thing but from Bluetooth and when

560
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,830
you think of like the ability to track a

561
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,360
Bluetooth device it becomes a little

562
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,610
scary when I can say hey I'm going to

563
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,679
you know look for Eric's left air pod

564
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,629
and I'm just going to follow it so if

565
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,220
you have a high gain antenna or you know

566
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,560
just anything you can just track a

567
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,200
single user and correlate their devices

568
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,669
where they're going and again all this

569
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,600
information is publicly available it's

570
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:33,280
just one of those things kind of have to

571
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:36,159
look under the hood to see and yes so

572
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,250
this is so the best part about Wireless

573
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:42,730
is that all for at least some of our

574
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,080
clients and a character passwords is you

575
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,700
know is the only thing you need to

576
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,620
breach their security and this is the

577
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,260
first iteration of our of our wireless

578
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,820
testing appliance that Matt so

579
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,600
graciously made a much better version of

580
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,189
which I think I have go so that's kind

581
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,209
of how well that works Matt if you want

582
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,940
to talk about your your design here sure

583
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:11,710
um

584
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:13,840
so Eric uh is a little guy go back to

585
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,600
those first a little more enthusiastic

586
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,959
than I am yeah yeah yeah so you could

587
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,389
see the ammo can down there right um so

588
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:26,010
Eric frequently has like really great

589
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:28,720
ideas but but he has so many ideas

590
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,860
easily half of them are crap like right

591
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,300
out of the gate half of them are

592
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:36,310
terrible ideas the other half maybe half

593
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,840
of those are amazing and the other half

594
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,730
would be amazing but they're too much

595
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,620
work so kind of when he and I are

596
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:45,430
working together on stuff the role we

597
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:48,070
play the roles we play he comes as sort

598
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:49,630
of the diviner inspired and I'm like

599
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,750
dude that's a terrible idea get off my

600
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,750
lawn

601
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,820
you showed up at my house one day with

602
00:23:54,549 --> 00:24:01,740
that green ammo can and it is stuffed

603
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:04,450
with like packing peanuts and like

604
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:08,799
raspberry pies it smells a little bit

605
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:12,429
like electrical fire there's like holes

606
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,929
cut it in places and magnets he's like

607
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:16,870
hey dude I figured out how to do

608
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:19,120
Wireless like remotely we could just use

609
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:22,600
an LP modem and put it in this ammo

610
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,939
cannon and ship it so he came over to my

611
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,860
house I have a two-story house we went

612
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,010
up on my balcony on the top storey and

613
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,928
threw it off to source typically what

614
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:35,400
happened with FedEx s we shipped one and

615
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:37,540
it not surprisingly broke open and

616
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,370
emptied its contents all over my

617
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:44,678
driveway which was hilarious because it

618
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,350
made Erik make like the saddest face

619
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,640
you've ever seen right but he had come

620
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,219
over here demonstrated that it was

621
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,440
viable it works when a guy here until I

622
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,040
went full jerk mode and tossed it off

623
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,340
the patio everything it in Florence

624
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:03,510
right and then it didn't anymore so we

625
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:07,840
took basically Eric's Radio Shack build

626
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:11,740
and like put it into a nice little gun

627
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,780
case we basically removed all of the so

628
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,710
off the shelf components that Eric had

629
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:20,940
used to sort of glue things together and

630
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,900
like 3d printed like an internal chassis

631
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,520
internal casing and components for

632
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,120
everything so that we could actually

633
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,950
expect the device to continue to work

634
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:35,799
when we had to ship it to Canada right

635
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:38,040
or wherever it was going so we had

636
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:40,629
substantial gains in sort of stability

637
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:44,080
with the devices like by going this

638
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,309
route um at this point we're sort of I

639
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,460
think reading it like the third

640
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:50,950
iteration where we've replaced the PI's

641
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:54,220
with like nooks which allows us to do

642
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:57,870
some cool SVR stuff right so we can

643
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:00,280
throw like a USRP radio in there um

644
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:03,280
basically you know you want to do like

645
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,149
low frequency you want to do you like

646
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,139
900 mega

647
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:09,400
like we have a platform right to cobble

648
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,320
together that will work with just about

649
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,710
any wireless technology that you're

650
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,710
employing

651
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,190
and for those those of you that are kind

652
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,590
of interested in and how like it

653
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,100
structurally kind of works so in this

654
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:26,449
one I kinda just threw the Nook in there

655
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,580
so the note basically communicates out

656
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:32,240
via LTE back to our you know C to our

657
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:34,310
Penn lab and I also keep a pie in it

658
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,540
mostly because I just love pies and it's

659
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,129
one of those things I feel a little

660
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:39,620
nostalgic and like I need to put one and

661
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,840
just about everything but what is nice

662
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,639
about having a pie that you think that

663
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,620
you communicate only with over serial

664
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,510
communication is that after you've

665
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,300
compromised the network you can always

666
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,970
just join it directly to that Network

667
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,139
and so there's no other you know network

668
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,460
that it's touching that's going to mess

669
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,860
anything up you not to worry about any

670
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,420
routing any anything like that so you

671
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,490
have that extra that extra pie in there

672
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,770
that definitely helps out and like matt

673
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,540
said to if you want to you can you know

674
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,970
we have we have one of these devices are

675
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,070
actually multiple of these boxes now

676
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,990
that have you know be two tens and there

677
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:14,179
which are super powerful you know

678
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,310
software-defined radio platform you know

679
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,500
we can throw in uber tooth no problem if

680
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,520
we're gonna do some bluetooth testing or

681
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,040
you know if we're gonna do like some

682
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,660
Apple bleah style attack we are to stick

683
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,720
one if we just want to do some simple

684
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:28,690
STR stuff and then the other one that I

685
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,260
have to is another

686
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,940
software-defined radio that can

687
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,110
basically Mouse jack so if you have a an

688
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,240
older-style

689
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,189
wireless mouse and keyboard you can

690
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,600
basically like remotely send keystrokes

691
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,640
to it because the encryption is broken

692
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,189
on that so it is one of those things

693
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,140
that is more of a platform and and more

694
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,460
importantly is that you know it can be

695
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:48,470
used as a device that we add to mail to

696
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,900
a client so we do a pen test remotely or

697
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,790
it's a device that you know that we can

698
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,790
take with us and you know basically add

699
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:57,139
to our you know pen testing repertoire

700
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,690
we're doing like so kind of red team on

701
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,430
site yeah so these are Matt's fancy

702
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,650
pictures and again I really should have

703
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:06,330
been coated in good

704
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,880
everything that was in the the backpack

705
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:11,909
from those earlier yes just names anger

706
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,470
one tiny pistol case and the the other

707
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,210
funding part I should have really you

708
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,210
know maybe so we ever give this talk

709
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:19,590
ever again I'll throw up some pictures

710
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,700
of what my original iteration was

711
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,800
because it was like I wanted like

712
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,690
jo-ann's fabric and got like you know

713
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,520
the the foam that you used to like

714
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,620
reupholster a chair and that was like

715
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:32,129
like layers of that and raspberry pies

716
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:33,389
in there it was I think I look over and

717
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,010
I'm like do you think this will catch on

718
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,140
fire is its flammable and he's just like

719
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,330
if you have to ask that question like we

720
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,790
need to change this so uh there's a

721
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:45,810
there's a very certain lack of package

722
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,889
myths and foam in here and then yeah and

723
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,120
Matt if you want to if you want to talk

724
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:51,870
about keep hammering kind of what that

725
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,209
is yeah so so this talk is sort of weird

726
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,840
it's sort of a like a general Wireless

727
00:28:54,210 --> 00:29:00,030
talk but it's really two parts it's it's

728
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,610
half the part we've done which is like

729
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,810
hey Wireless here's a here's some stuff

730
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,919
about it that you might not have thought

731
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:09,929
of and the other half of this is sort of

732
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,840
trying to drive some change in the way

733
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:16,470
that that offenses security consulting

734
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:19,770
services work for ember Wireless has

735
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,390
been sort of that that you know under

736
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:25,230
your breath like oh yeah whatever it's

737
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:29,750
just a wireless network right and before

738
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:33,240
we started plumbing Wireless up to SCADA

739
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:36,060
that that was a reasonable sort of

740
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:41,850
assumption operate on it's not anymore

741
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:45,659
like we routinely take you know a quote

742
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:49,770
unquote Wireless assessment to control

743
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:51,360
of SCADA or to compromise of all for

744
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:56,540
assault trusted force all trusted

745
00:29:51,360 --> 00:30:00,479
domains and it's interesting because

746
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:03,240
clients generally are not used to that

747
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,980
kind of focused attack on their wireless

748
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,650
network right they're used to like

749
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:11,820
somebody coming in with with the cart

750
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:16,050
and doing like heat maps and auditing

751
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:18,330
for WEP right or stuff that was cutting

752
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:23,029
edge a decade ago maybe

753
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:27,240
no I haven't seen weapon a long time but

754
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:29,730
the idea is that your wireless really is

755
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,610
just an extension of your internal

756
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:36,210
networks without any physical access

757
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:39,750
control right almost every place I go

758
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:42,659
you can get any of their wireless

759
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:45,090
networks from the parking lot and we

760
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:47,429
work with relatively large organizations

761
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:50,059
and so I know if it's affecting them

762
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:54,029
it's affecting smaller places too but

763
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:56,010
basically what you have is an internal

764
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:59,809
it's like like if you put an Ethernet

765
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:04,429
jack in the alley behind your building

766
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:08,010
and we see this so much you know we

767
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:10,559
probably out of a sample of like ten

768
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,210
Wireless assessments that that will do

769
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,990
are teeny of four or five guys to do the

770
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:17,549
majority of our Wireless probably

771
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,529
somewhere between seven and nine of them

772
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:23,870
will end in a complete compromise of the

773
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:23,870
entire organization from wireless

774
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:32,070
and and it's low-hanging fruit now

775
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,070
because this is sort of a new model

776
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,110
we're not there to do an assessment

777
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:40,429
we're there to show you what could

778
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:44,209
happen right and the tools that support

779
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:46,279
wireless have gotten to the point where

780
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,690
they're just amazing like each hammer is

781
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:51,559
a great example

782
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:53,210
each hammer basically a wireless

783
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:58,360
framework that will do all of your

784
00:31:53,210 --> 00:32:04,130
man-in-the-middle the authentication of

785
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:08,449
in range clients karma basically so you

786
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:11,120
can supply a SSID name that it will

787
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:15,590
stand up a rogue ap for you you can

788
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,928
provide a MAC address when your target

789
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:21,289
client is disconnected from their

790
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:24,559
current session your access point goes

791
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:27,830
up matching not only the network

792
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:30,590
Wireless name but also the bssid the MAC

793
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:33,649
address of the access point so you have

794
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:35,959
a perfect spoof all that needs to happen

795
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:38,510
is for that client to initiate

796
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,179
authentication with you and if they are

797
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:44,029
not that wireless network is not doing

798
00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:49,039
both client and server side certificate

799
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:52,270
validation I will almost certainly get

800
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:55,279
hashed Reds and I'll most likely get

801
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:57,379
plaintext crebbs if that's somebody with

802
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,720
a BYOD phone or something that supports

803
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:02,330
a GG C downgrade so I don't even have to

804
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,470
crack a hash at that point and this tool

805
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:08,629
you know if you are comfortable with

806
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:12,110
some basic fundamentals of wireless and

807
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:14,630
navigating Linux command line this tool

808
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:17,889
might take you an hour to become

809
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:22,250
proficient enough at using to execute

810
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:24,190
relatively sophisticated attacks and I

811
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,360
think you sort of have this perfect

812
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:28,700
perfect storm where the tools have

813
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,699
gotten really good and nobody is paying

814
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,230
attention to wireless right that's

815
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,510
that's the sort of other interesting

816
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,340
particularly in the size crash last year

817
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,230
I probably did thirty five Wireless

818
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,408
assessments probably did thirty let's

819
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,409
say

820
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:50,070
in my time it secures I've probably done

821
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:52,678
50 or 60 I have never seen a log from a

822
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:55,168
point of contact at a client with any

823
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,450
detection of anything I've ever done on

824
00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:01,379
their wireless network I have gone to

825
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,460
look at logs after a test and found that

826
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:04,529
there were a ton of wireless

827
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,990
notifications for rogue epeans that I

828
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:09,149
was standing up but the wireless

829
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:11,460
networks not important so those just go

830
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:14,879
straight to them no right like though

831
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,530
some logged or aggregated so the

832
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,940
rest of this talk really is sort of

833
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:20,730
about shifting that paradigm from

834
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,918
Wireless being like this thing that we

835
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,449
don't really need to worry about to

836
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:27,480
wireless being this thing that we really

837
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:33,449
should pay attention to Oh

838
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:35,819
kick it back to you here here you guys

839
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:40,279
Jim you okay sir I got I got bounced off

840
00:34:35,819 --> 00:34:40,279
for a second yeah I hear you all right

841
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,859
cool

842
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,250
you

843
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,250
you

844
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:56,179
and so you've got the next big str of

845
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,179
your TA

846
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,109
every there

847
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,690
so you can see I'm gonna

848
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:12,900
for Eric here for a minute you can see

849
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:15,450
this is a sort of the latest iteration

850
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,640
of the so we call the wireless remote

851
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:19,859
testing appliance with WR TAS right

852
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,940
pretty pretty creative acronym you can

853
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,670
see these ones are a little bigger they

854
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,560
actually have I think they're 40

855
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:29,460
millimeter fans top and bottom there for

856
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,810
push-pull there's a couple iterations of

857
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:35,790
that that's actually the one that we use

858
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:39,330
just send out the us our peas the the

859
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:41,730
SDR radios from Edison for sort of

860
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:45,180
non-traditional non 2.49 five gigahertz

861
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,920
Wireless testing we also have a box that

862
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,109
looks a lot like that and if you've been

863
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,110
on any of the other b-sides on the East

864
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:53,130
Coast you might have seen Michael Bryant

865
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,560
lugging one of those around was a whole

866
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:57,600
bunch of pies in it doing sort of the

867
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,140
wireless travelling CTF that we have set

868
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,110
up

869
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:04,049
[Music]

870
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:05,250
yeah so what looks like the USRP radios

871
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:09,210
on the right-hand side they're got a

872
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:13,860
panel on the back and it's interesting

873
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:16,710
because Eric is driving yeah there we go

874
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,330
thank ya okay yeah it is like killing

875
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,520
momentarily dropping out but ya know

876
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,500
Matt covered it perfectly um this this

877
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,840
device basically just extends way past

878
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,670
the Wi-Fi gets you into the range of

879
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,230
pretty much I realist but he's wireless

880
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:31,410
right like I can open your garage door

881
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:33,570
with this I can you know disable your

882
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,250
simply safe alarm you know at home with

883
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:37,410
this like I mean it does it does a ton

884
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,270
of stuff right so this is basically just

885
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:42,390
to show that Wireless was anywhere that

886
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:45,330
there's not wires and so to think that

887
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,460
Wi-Fi is just as niche tests or wireless

888
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,960
wireless pen test it's just an itch test

889
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,750
that like you know only super big

890
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,550
organizations need or require it's kind

891
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:56,100
of the opposite right every you know

892
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:58,410
everything that doesn't have a wire

893
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,330
which is now everything is is you know

894
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,399
susceptible and vulnerable you look at

895
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:04,620
all the Bluetooth sharing options that

896
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,910
are out there you look at you know just

897
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,580
how you can catch from one device to

898
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:11,190
another you look how you know you open

899
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,529
pretty much anything now if I'm able to

900
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,440
hop on that connection whether we know

901
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:17,730
no matter what Wireless means are there

902
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,830
you know it's a fun place to be for an

903
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:20,760
adversary and especially two because one

904
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,759
of the things that I found is that

905
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,440
Wireless is one of those technologies or

906
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,900
Wireless in general is just the

907
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,730
technology susceptible to being super

908
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,140
old because everything have to be

909
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,240
backwards compatible everything has to

910
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,560
work in general right and so that's

911
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,350
where that's where manufacturers get

912
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,779
into a bit of a bind of you know like

913
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:41,850
hey if even if there is WPA three out

914
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,950
there you know what's going to support

915
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,370
that how long is wpa2 still going to be

916
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:47,220
around

917
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,569
I mean look look how long WEP you know

918
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,810
still whether I'm like I don't see it

919
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:53,460
very often anymore but you know it's

920
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,960
still in some places like I mean I've

921
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,450
seen it in the past couple of you know

922
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,430
in the past couple of months I've seen

923
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:01,470
you know web on client sites it's not

924
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,940
common but and everybody knows that it's

925
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:05,759
broken and yet it's still out there and

926
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:07,740
I can only imagine that WPSU is gonna be

927
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,600
the same way so was one of those things

928
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,220
that I think the the point that we're

929
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,160
trying to drive home is that Wireless is

930
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,060
is not a niche test it's not a niche pen

931
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,890
test

932
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,820
in fact it should be you know included

933
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:22,609
yeah as a part of like a trifecta of

934
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:25,110
internal/external and wireless because

935
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:25,320
because if I were to ask a client right

936
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,540
now

937
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,460
hey can you go pull up your wireless

938
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,920
logs a lot of times you're just going to

939
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,930
blank stare of like what like they may

940
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,080
not even be taking logs let alone doing

941
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:38,040
any detection let's see if I can flip

942
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,069
the next slide yeah

943
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:44,009
so just I'll do a quick story and then

944
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:46,440
Matt can just obviously just fill in my

945
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:51,420
audio cuts out I just I was on a pen

946
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:54,350
test this last last month he was for it

947
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,630
was for some large company right and

948
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:59,610
what happened in it is they purchased an

949
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,080
internal pen test and external pen test

950
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,990
and a wireless pen test so kind of the

951
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:06,770
the perfect sweet spot that I kind of

952
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:08,970
feel like of covering all their bases

953
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,930
you know everything from the wireless

954
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,180
looks pretty darn good

955
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,259
there you know it's a little bit of

956
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,669
interesting time right now because

957
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,860
obviously Cova there's not a lot of

958
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:19,440
users in the office and like I was

959
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,670
talking about before you need user you

960
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,560
know you need end-user interaction

961
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,630
typically to gain some sort of

962
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,820
credentials but paired with one of our

963
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:28,170
external penetration tests you know they

964
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:31,110
did some password spraying against

965
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:33,450
office 365 and even though the office

966
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:36,210
365 instance required multi-factor

967
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:38,609
authentication we basically said well

968
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:41,130
what are the odds that that even though

969
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:43,530
office 365 requires MFA that I can just

970
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,840
reuse those credentials to to hop on

971
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:47,400
their wireless network sure enough you

972
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,660
know those users credentials even though

973
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,810
they were they had two-factor

974
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:53,520
authentication on office 365 worked just

975
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:55,799
fine to get me into the wireless network

976
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,270
I'm on their corporate network and I

977
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,850
think it was four hours later that we

978
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,590
had you know compromised her domain and

979
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:04,440
another four hours later to where we

980
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:07,410
were skated administrator on this you

981
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,990
know on this ideas platform and it was a

982
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:11,430
it was an interesting place to be as an

983
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,410
attacker and I don't say this as like

984
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:15,750
the oh my gosh look at Erin's big bad

985
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:18,120
hacker look what he can do but it really

986
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:20,430
gave our clients the ammunition you know

987
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,009
to say hey this is this is what was

988
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:24,690
included in the report and it turned our

989
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:27,030
clients from saying hey we know that

990
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,350
this is an issue to their board then you

991
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,060
know somebody could do something

992
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,470
somebody could attack us in this way

993
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,080
somebody could gain access in this way

994
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:37,259
to say hey somebody did gain access to

995
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,390
us in under a week you know leveraging

996
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,310
all of our technology and we didn't we

997
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:43,140
didn't even see them coming and so

998
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,850
that's that's really what what I think

999
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,799
I'm trying to get out as kind of like

1000
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:49,049
the final piece of this is is that

1001
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,860
Wireless is a is a part of a broader

1002
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:54,630
range of pentesting you know activities

1003
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:57,300
but it is just as dangerous it is just

1004
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:59,490
as lethal it's not a niche thing and

1005
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,350
really at the end of the day if it's not

1006
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,540
so that we can you know say oh look at

1007
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:05,549
us look look how cool we are is it so

1008
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:08,759
that our clients you know they have a

1009
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:10,460
awareness of what a nation-state you

1010
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,840
know they have the awareness of what a

1011
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,610
you know persistent adversary actually

1012
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,960
would do it's not it's not a message and

1013
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,970
we're you know they're gonna get a

1014
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,640
report that just has all you have you

1015
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:23,029
know this you know SSL v3 somewhere it's

1016
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,560
hey this is how we were able to access

1017
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:28,170
you know the data that keeps you up at

1018
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,160
night so anyways yeah that's kind of my

1019
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,420
story I don't know if Matt won't throw

1020
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,879
in the historic aynd of elaborate on

1021
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,500
that one but but yeah I just I think

1022
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,260
that illustrates nicely they like the

1023
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,390
point of of combining different types of

1024
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:43,470
pen testing to to leverage full domain

1025
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:45,120
compromise yeah you also have another

1026
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:46,980
interesting sort of point in there Eric

1027
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,500
and you hinted at it but I think it's

1028
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:52,130
worth saying flat out if you are

1029
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:55,170
partnering with mentee who's doing

1030
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:58,520
penetration testing for you whether it's

1031
00:41:55,170 --> 00:42:01,650
Wireless or or internal or external if

1032
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,020
if that company is worth working with

1033
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:06,840
their goal is to give you as their

1034
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:10,320
client the leverage that you need to

1035
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:13,170
affect positive security change on your

1036
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,290
network right if you're not getting that

1037
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:19,200
back you should go find another provider

1038
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:20,700
who is actually looking to partner with

1039
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,149
you to help you make your things more

1040
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,839
secure I still run into people doing

1041
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,840
this kind of work

1042
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:33,019
where they were they wanting you know

1043
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:37,788
phlex who believed with their with their

1044
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:40,660
technical skills you know there was a

1045
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:43,249
place in time for that like the before

1046
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:46,279
we started seeing some semblance of

1047
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:47,868
maturity in you know security consulting

1048
00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:49,549
space like that that was a reasonable

1049
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:51,380
thing because you had to kind of shock

1050
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:52,999
and awe people into wait a second these

1051
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:58,849
computer things we got to watch out for

1052
00:42:52,999 --> 00:43:02,089
stuff but at this point the people that

1053
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:04,849
you want breaking in to your place are

1054
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:07,640
the people whose goal is to pride you

1055
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:10,309
the leverage to affect the change that

1056
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:13,279
you already know is is requisite right

1057
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:15,440
for your network Wireless fits into that

1058
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:17,119
really well but that should be the

1059
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,109
general approach that you're getting

1060
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,819
from any security vendor service based

1061
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:25,359
security vendor that you're working with

1062
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:28,788
you want somebody who is bringing you

1063
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,319
leverage so that you know you can get

1064
00:43:28,789 --> 00:43:32,809
the budget you need to go do the

1065
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,869
projects that you want to do that's not

1066
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:38,160
it's not really story time but it is it

1067
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:41,309
is a thing that I

1068
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,490
it from our clients frequently that that

1069
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:48,089
you know our team is the SecureWorks

1070
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:50,479
advert adversarial testing group right

1071
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:55,140
and we get different responses to that a

1072
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,880
lot of sort of the ELT c-suite folk are

1073
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:59,430
like why would we call it adversarial

1074
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,589
testing I mean because of the mindset

1075
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:03,690
right we we think about how somebody

1076
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:05,670
would actually attack you it's not

1077
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:09,420
adversarial in that I'm going to be a

1078
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:13,079
jerk when we're talking on the phone so

1079
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:15,809
it's not a cool story time but it is

1080
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:18,460
sort of a general general approach like

1081
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:21,849
if if you're not

1082
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,829
getting actionable information in Intel

1083
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:26,260
and demonstration of issues on your

1084
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:28,240
network from your providers like go find

1085
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,869
a provider who'll get it for who give

1086
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,868
you what you need

1087
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:37,629
tackle the big rocks on your network um

1088
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:41,070
I you know there are so many vendors out

1089
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:43,650
there go go try vendor if you're

1090
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:46,840
experienced at this point has not been

1091
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,100
you know what you think it should be go

1092
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,140
try something else whether that secure

1093
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:52,360
work sir or anybody else out there it's

1094
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,680
better than continuing on with somebody

1095
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,270
who's demonstrated that they're not

1096
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,810
really interested in providing you with

1097
00:44:55,270 --> 00:45:00,160
the service that you want right which is

1098
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:03,490
some help getting leverage to fix stuff

1099
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:07,270
I feel like I feel like this is very

1100
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:09,580
much like hey you go to the doctor you

1101
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:11,230
should go exercise 30 minutes a day and

1102
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,400
eat your fruits and vegetables it's

1103
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:14,440
stuff that you know you should be doing

1104
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,870
it stuff is good for the health of your

1105
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,120
organization but it helps to hear it and

1106
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:21,130
it helps to I feel like it's just one of

1107
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,480
the things it helps you know hear it

1108
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,560
again and reinforce it again and again

1109
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,290
and again

1110
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,420
so again yeah maybe it's not a super

1111
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:31,420
sexy wireless euro day dropping or

1112
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:33,490
anything like that but but at the end of

1113
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,110
the day I think you know I've never

1114
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:38,169
broken into a client with a zero-day

1115
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:40,150
it's always been you know finding some

1116
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:43,470
some security control but that's not a

1117
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:47,890
CH tor a person that's not talked to

1118
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:49,990
yeah and they're usually known they're

1119
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:52,089
usually things that client points a

1120
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:55,390
contact know know where problems right

1121
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:56,920
it we're not we're not we're frequently

1122
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:59,350
not finding things that they didn't know

1123
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:02,380
right we we find unknown unknowns that

1124
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:04,600
happens that's great

1125
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,470
so frequently we're abusing stuff that

1126
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:12,580
they knew we were going to abuse like

1127
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:14,080
yeah just just the character I know is

1128
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,650
with that does anybody have any

1129
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,650
questions for us

1130
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:22,769
I don't know if I can change the

1131
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:27,839
presenters viewers

1132
00:46:22,769 --> 00:46:32,218
yeah I'm looking in the chat and in

1133
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:35,249
discord as well I think it's a one

1134
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:37,199
question that comes up is this is great

1135
00:46:35,249 --> 00:46:38,519
especially I appreciate this you guys

1136
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:40,380
come in and I have a couple of my

1137
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:42,269
students from my Greenbelt tech class is

1138
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,579
how does somebody get you know what's

1139
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:48,720
the best way or get suggestions on how

1140
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:51,360
somebody get started in Wi-Fi security

1141
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,009
I think the the first step is to mess

1142
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,930
around with your home network you know

1143
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:58,290
get a see if you don't already have it

1144
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:00,930
you know get a a wireless card or

1145
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:02,550
wireless adapter that supports something

1146
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:04,109
called monitor mode basically if you

1147
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:05,160
just live on Amazon there's there's an

1148
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,930
adaptive values for pretty much

1149
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,839
everything it's just called a panda it's

1150
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:11,279
like a PA you nine hundred six hundred I

1151
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,860
think it's a six hundred PA you six

1152
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,660
hundred but it's basically dual-band

1153
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:17,940
which means it does 5.8 gigahertz and

1154
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,440
2.4 gigahertz it can go into monitor

1155
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,750
mode on both which basically just means

1156
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,530
that it can you know you can basically

1157
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:27,420
unlock a little bit more features and

1158
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:29,040
then you know talking super technical

1159
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:31,110
you know locks um some features in it

1160
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,050
that you know Linux tools can take

1161
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:37,170
advantage of and then the other part of

1162
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:38,670
that too is that you get out of it you

1163
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,590
know just bill you can plug it into a

1164
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,910
laptop I recommend you know getting the

1165
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:44,460
raspberry pi because shocking I'd

1166
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:45,870
recommend a Raspberry Pi but it's a

1167
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,860
cheap easy little platform you down to

1168
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,540
mess with like your main operating

1169
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:51,330
system or do anything to get stuff to

1170
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,710
work and really you can you can take

1171
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:54,299
that and look at your own home network

1172
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:56,640
obviously don't mess any network that's

1173
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:58,770
not yours and just see hey can you

1174
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,029
recover your own password you know by

1175
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:02,070
watching a couple YouTube videos

1176
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:03,840
watching a couple talks on how wireless

1177
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,550
technology works and I think it's

1178
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,780
fitting that's the best place to go just

1179
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,630
to see what you can do on your own

1180
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,220
network and then you know and then just

1181
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,120
you can I mean the beautiful parts

1182
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,029
everybody has a wireless network

1183
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,830
typically that they have that their own

1184
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:18,240
and if you don't it's cheating easy to

1185
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:20,460
just get like a little access point that

1186
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,970
you can you know do your do your tax

1187
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,850
again

1188
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:26,459
so some be my recommendation is is check

1189
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:28,440
out that panda wireless adapter watch a

1190
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,580
couple talks watched a couple videos and

1191
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,750
then if you have the opportunity to go

1192
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:34,980
to any conferences you know and you know

1193
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,290
I think the ones I can think of are like

1194
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:41,190
shmoocon if you're on the East Coast

1195
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:42,270
besides Delaware if you go to shoot I

1196
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,260
mean that's your beachhead screams oh oh

1197
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,250
like basically just just look for

1198
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,110
conferences and see if they have any

1199
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,000
wireless village because then you'll be

1200
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:49,110
able to talk to talk to people that know

1201
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,830
stuff and they'll probably have some

1202
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:51,830
challenges for you

1203
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:57,320
love excess lot of food for thought

1204
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:03,079
a couple other questions so what are the

1205
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:05,539
common issues you come across and

1206
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:08,559
household Wi-Fi is other than us

1207
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:08,559
creating a spoof

1208
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:14,869
so other other things that we see like

1209
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:18,430
other attacks that we that we perform or

1210
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:19,839
other other just like like

1211
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:23,270
misconfigurations

1212
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:26,930
yeah maybe yeah read that word for word

1213
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:30,910
but maybe yeah just common other issues

1214
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:30,910
that you see in Wi-Fi just in general

1215
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:38,819
then I'll let you do you want them yeah

1216
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:42,328
so so many things start start with a

1217
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:45,599
spoof right because ultimately the goal

1218
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:48,119
is to get credentialed access and if

1219
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,339
you're trying to convince somebody maybe

1220
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:52,049
maybe you're not even spoofing you know

1221
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:53,759
corporate networks maybe if you're

1222
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:57,529
watching what those client devices are

1223
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:01,799
beaconing for and you see you know River

1224
00:49:57,529 --> 00:50:03,390
Matt Comcast home router so I

1225
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:09,619
matcom get some router and get an auto

1226
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:09,618
connect it's hard to even

1227
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:17,720
so Eric made a comment earlier about

1228
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:20,070
everything that is not wired is Wireless

1229
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:23,720
and that's that's a really big statement

1230
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:28,410
they kind of broke me at first because

1231
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:30,810
because it's so ubiquitous right it's

1232
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:33,049
everywhere so to try to think of what

1233
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:33,049
other

1234
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,050
common things right as a corporate

1235
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:42,830
network pen tester I'm I'm breaking into

1236
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:45,530
corporate Wireless I'm spoofing stuff um

1237
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:47,600
but I've you know gosh the the thing I

1238
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:50,630
always think of is when I travel with my

1239
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:53,089
little like Roku stick and I have my my

1240
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:55,790
little LTE access point that I set up to

1241
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:58,370
spoof my home network name so that my

1242
00:50:55,790 --> 00:51:01,880
Roku stick will auto connect right it's

1243
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:04,078
it's that same exact same idea right

1244
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,029
like I'm just taking

1245
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,549
things that I know must exist for this

1246
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:10,199
technology to work there must be a way

1247
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:13,439
for it to communicate in some

1248
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:15,509
back-channel right in sort of shining

1249
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:21,178
shining light on that and almost always

1250
00:51:15,509 --> 00:51:23,369
some some hack falls out gosh stuff

1251
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:24,420
that's it I don't even I can't even

1252
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:26,789
think of anything that I've done

1253
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:29,819
recently that didn't involve spoofing an

1254
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:32,339
AP in some way to get I can establish an

1255
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:35,269
initial access I think the other thing

1256
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:38,160
to that that is a much bigger problem

1257
00:51:35,269 --> 00:51:40,948
that maybe people don't realize is just

1258
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,170
just the sheer fact of you know your

1259
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:45,479
normal Wi-Fi that you have at home your

1260
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:47,689
pre shared key a lot of organizations

1261
00:51:45,479 --> 00:51:49,739
will have a you know instead of running

1262
00:51:47,689 --> 00:51:51,390
you know an enterprise network where

1263
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:53,880
everybody is required to use a username

1264
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:55,979
and password to log into Wi-Fi they just

1265
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,880
all have a shared password and that's

1266
00:51:55,979 --> 00:52:01,739
that's so that's so damaging because it

1267
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,929
only takes one employee to give it to

1268
00:52:01,739 --> 00:52:06,420
their you know girlfriend or wife or kid

1269
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:09,509
it only takes one employee to get fired

1270
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:11,670
you know to where then you're left

1271
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:13,499
you were left with overshoot do we

1272
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,150
change the wireless password every time

1273
00:52:13,499 --> 00:52:18,089
that we get a new employee will refire

1274
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:20,249
noon or we fire an employee you know

1275
00:52:18,089 --> 00:52:23,729
there's nothing there's no way to stop

1276
00:52:20,249 --> 00:52:25,399
you know a person from just giving that

1277
00:52:23,729 --> 00:52:27,058
out to somebody else there's no like

1278
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,829
certificates there's nothing right and

1279
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:31,589
so I think that's another thing that

1280
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:33,569
that maybe isn't you know something that

1281
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:35,038
we directly leverage in a pen test you

1282
00:52:33,569 --> 00:52:36,929
know we're not we're not typically

1283
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,309
always know I mean I've called it a

1284
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:39,719
mission a couple people in the giving me

1285
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:42,449
a wireless password but but typically

1286
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:44,279
that's not what we do but but with those

1287
00:52:42,449 --> 00:52:46,709
kind of pre shared key networks where

1288
00:52:44,279 --> 00:52:48,390
one key gets you on to that network

1289
00:52:46,709 --> 00:52:50,308
anybody can share it can be posted in a

1290
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:52,439
conference room and so it's not the

1291
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:54,989
super sexy like oh man look at this like

1292
00:52:52,439 --> 00:52:55,949
way that we broke in but it's just one

1293
00:52:54,989 --> 00:52:56,670
of those things that if you run a

1294
00:52:55,949 --> 00:52:59,400
wireless network

1295
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:01,439
just kind of keep in mind that that that

1296
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,819
just anybody can hand out that key and

1297
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:04,199
you're only strong is that one key

1298
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:08,480
there's no second factor authentication

1299
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:11,869
or anything like that for Frank

1300
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,970
it's a bit scary when we see networks

1301
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:17,270
with just that one key and maybe a very

1302
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:19,459
simple T advanced certificates are good

1303
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:20,720
right yeah well and especially to you

1304
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,070
because you have so many like IOT

1305
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,540
devices out there right like so many

1306
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,950
just random devices that doesn't have

1307
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,380
screens that you need to somehow connect

1308
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:29,149
to a wireless network and so more and

1309
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:30,890
more now you're seeing a bunch you know

1310
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:32,180
like like companies will have a guest

1311
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:34,129
network and they'll have a corporate

1312
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:36,319
network and will have an IOC Network and

1313
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:38,690
a lot of times they're I owe to networks

1314
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:41,720
is the same level of access as their

1315
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:43,250
internal corporate network and so the

1316
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,259
only thing that changes there is like oh

1317
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:46,849
oh now like all of you know your

1318
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:48,020
security cameras and your current

1319
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:49,730
bridges and all that stuff

1320
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:51,470
don't work in - all it takes is me

1321
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:53,869
spoofing that to now have the same level

1322
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:55,669
of access so it's just just one of them

1323
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:58,190
you like network access controls right

1324
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:59,599
like on the internal network but all you

1325
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:01,609
have to do is start looking at Wireless

1326
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,320
or things on IOT because you know they

1327
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:05,690
got stuck on ISP probably because they

1328
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,210
don't support certificate op so you you

1329
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:10,460
spoof a map of one of those connect to

1330
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:12,410
IOT and you just bypassed network access

1331
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,750
control because you don't need to be

1332
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:16,129
physically connected yeah that's good

1333
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,839
that's a good plan I didn't even think

1334
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:20,960
about that where you don't have that

1335
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:23,029
capability of the G devices right and

1336
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,450
where where that where that is really

1337
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:27,920
really really scary is we do a bunt I

1338
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:30,230
mean we've done a bunch of tests for

1339
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,180
hospitals right when all of a sudden

1340
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:34,670
your intro and hump when all of a sudden

1341
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:37,098
you're like you know you know some

1342
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:39,800
controller for some life-saving device

1343
00:54:37,099 --> 00:54:41,359
and or you see the medical devices or

1344
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,290
you I come up and you're just like no no

1345
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,020
no no stop

1346
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:47,060
yeah your label yeah I don't want to I

1347
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,980
don't want to start being a device is

1348
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,900
there an active surgery right like like

1349
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,640
those are the things that like you know

1350
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,170
it oh is it a bummer if you know

1351
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,670
somebody takes your nests or missed that

1352
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:57,650
off and like your house gets a little

1353
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:59,960
warmer yeah that's a bummer but you know

1354
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:02,839
see the movies on your liver though yeah

1355
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:04,579
when when it's all of a sudden you know

1356
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:06,799
somebody likes your blood sugar

1357
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:08,660
feel Wi-Fi like that that's a problem

1358
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,670
and so it is one of those things that

1359
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:13,118
yeah again it's not it's not something

1360
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:15,560
immediately thought of or super sexy but

1361
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,170
somebody with a shared password for all

1362
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:20,240
of the you know medical devices that all

1363
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:22,200
meet this one criteria in a hospital

1364
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,479
they if they all have their own network

1365
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:27,839
if somebody helps on that network a lot

1366
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,850
of times especially with with with

1367
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:32,520
critical you know I would consider that

1368
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:34,680
to be critical infrastructure is that

1369
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,330
they're given a wide berth as far as

1370
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,129
security goes you know they're given

1371
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:39,750
more access and they probably need

1372
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:42,510
because nobody wants to be the guy that

1373
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:44,790
you know stopped some life-saving device

1374
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:46,740
from working because you know the

1375
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:51,330
actually put a guy in a coma update the

1376
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:53,129
firmware yeah they don't want to

1377
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:56,190
restrict that and so because of that if

1378
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:57,870
you can hop on that network you know you

1379
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,250
know to basically take advantage of that

1380
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:02,160
that wide hallway you used to go through

1381
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,350
now all of a sudden oh that that was the

1382
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,640
way that a user got in and it doesn't

1383
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:08,009
even really have to do with whatever the

1384
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,980
device is it's just that is a that is a

1385
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:13,800
a message that's that an attacker would

1386
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,880
use that's typically not seen right so I

1387
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,220
mean maybe that's not at the heart of

1388
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,020
the question but but it is one thing

1389
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:22,140
just I think it's just interesting can

1390
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:25,820
you keep in mind oh definitely no I

1391
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:25,819
appreciate the additional insights

1392
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:35,509
yeah lots of think about there I have my

1393
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:38,569
mind right we owner let's see it's about

1394
00:56:35,509 --> 00:56:43,549
12 11 so we're gonna be on lunch break
