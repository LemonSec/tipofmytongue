1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,820
yes okay thanks Mike appreciate that

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,320
I was joking around with Mike yesterday

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,360
about this as well if he's learned

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,430
anything about running beside Greenville

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,779
I'm hopefully at this point he's learned

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,220
that if you want to ensure your

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,200
conference either gets canceled or

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,660
delayed you invited me to be the keynote

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,689
speaker for those of you that that don't

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,850
really know what I'm talking about in

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,410
2017 besides cream but we like a freak

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,840
winter storm I think it was in the

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,309
spring or in the late winter that calls

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,230
besides Greenville to get too late about

15
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,720
six months and then of course he turns

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,690
around invites being again for 2020 and

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,760
then all of this happens so it's it's

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,149
it's ironic it's funny it's an inside

19
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,550
joke but whatever another inside joke is

20
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,930
is the fact is this I founded by you'll

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,599
comment up here and we might get to that

22
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,070
here in just a moment but you're here to

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,780
see a talk called sucking at capitalism

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,640
okay that's the name and I realized his

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,710
first time most of you are hearing this

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,489
I didn't really give it to Mike with

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,780
enough time to get it out in any type of

28
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,219
marketing or anything but that's the

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,899
name of the talk here and it really kind

30
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:12,359
of revolves around ethics in the

31
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:15,630
business of InfoSec once again i'm tim

32
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,729
tomes also known as land master 53 so

33
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,719
i've been around long enough to see

34
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,600
things done a lot of different ways

35
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,850
helped start a consultancy i've helped

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,889
resurrect the consultancy i've worked as

37
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,990
a senior principal and managing

38
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:29,520
consultant started my own training

39
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,189
company this company also does

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,020
development consulting work i've been a

41
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,458
director of training for an organization

42
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,170
i've been a contract trainer I've done

43
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:41,219
Quality Assurance for several training

44
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,349
companies I was a senior leader for the

45
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,079
for an NSA army certified red team or

46
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:47,249
NSA certified army red team and I was a

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,538
guy that built the curriculum for the

48
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:50,490
Army's first cyber training for a

49
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:52,409
program which has since become the cyber

50
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,199
branch of the Army and so I say these

51
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,139
things not to Pat myself on the back

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,939
okay I say them because I've seen a lot

53
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:01,679
of different organizations do fee for

54
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,658
service work I mean I've had a chance to

55
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:05,039
learn a ton from my own experiences but

56
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,659
also the experience of others because

57
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:08,399
the leaders I've got to receive

58
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,160
mentorship from during that process and

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,200
for some opinions about how we do ethics

60
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,990
and InfoSec business and I'm just here

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,380
to basically share those opinions now

62
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:20,230
another funny

63
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:23,170
probably the only funny point about this

64
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,940
is is well I'm getting ready to like

65
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,410
slam all over capitalism at least the

66
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,210
way that we're currently doing it in fo

67
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,579
sec and then my good friend Adam

68
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,980
Anderson whom I love dearly and I know

69
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,050
is listening right now otherwise known

70
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,799
as the Nancy Kerrigan because he is the

71
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,940
Upstate is A's second favorite speaker

72
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,040
he's probably gonna get up and tell you

73
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,190
to do all of the things that I'm telling

74
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,470
you not to do okay so the irony there is

75
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,910
real and it's funny so feel free to see

76
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,380
this as kind of a pre-emptive flame

77
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,150
session for everything that I'm gonna

78
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,450
talk about I'm sorry Adam I love you

79
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,430
brother

80
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,929
I'm sure you'll have wonderful things to

81
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,760
say so

82
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,260
I usually start talks with a disclaimer

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,810
and you know when you see a slide like

84
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,340
this that I could potentially be saying

85
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,690
something that's gonna get me in trouble

86
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,330
alright that's basically what it comes

87
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,430
down to number one I'm not going to name

88
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,020
any names I'm gonna talk about some

89
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,280
real-world examples and some real-world

90
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,410
experiences that I've had with

91
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,910
organizations but as both as an employee

92
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:20,140
and as a consumer and as an individual

93
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,390
there's a good chance that you may be

94
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,549
able to make assumptions and and figure

95
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,899
out who I'm talking about but I'm not

96
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,370
going to give away in fact I'm not gonna

97
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,709
give away links to materials I'm not

98
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,989
going to say any names I'm going to try

99
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,730
to be as anonymous or non attributional

100
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:36,160
as possible about these things because I

101
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,649
think some of this can good somewhat

102
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:43,180
help people form somewhat of a black eye

103
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:45,250
about about certain organizations and

104
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,050
and output a black eye on some

105
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,580
organizations or form opinions and I

106
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,080
don't want to necessarily do that I just

107
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,900
want to point out some systemic issues

108
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,370
here also know that much of this is

109
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,080
subjective this is my opinion and this

110
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,700
is based on my experiences these are

111
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,200
based on my circumstances this is based

112
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,149
on my view of the world so there's a

113
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,488
really good chance that a lot of you are

114
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,440
going to have different views different

115
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,060
opinions and that is completely okay

116
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,670
with me and it should be okay with you

117
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,160
I'm just up here up here sharing mine

118
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,708
and you are free to either take that or

119
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,670
leave it and the last thing is is

120
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,649
because of that I could potentially

121
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,478
offend someone now I don't ever seek to

122
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:21,039
offend but I realized that there are

123
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,200
definitely people out there that do seek

124
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,810
to be offended those individuals usually

125
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,310
find what they're looking for I ask you

126
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:33,020
to be open-minded open-hearted listen

127
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,370
understand engage in dialogue and then

128
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,810
and then we'll kind of move on from

129
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,000
there once again this is very subjective

130
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,290
very opinionated and that typically

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,660
leads down that road of possibly

132
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,100
offending people so let's talk about a

133
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,630
couple of very different companies in

134
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,280
our industry and while these two

135
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,960
companies are hypothetical both of them

136
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,229
exhibit qualities of various companies

137
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,630
that have either word for or I have been

138
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,150
a customer of within our industry and

139
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,890
these are all within our industry so

140
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,929
number one consulting number 1 develops

141
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,000
and distributes open-source tool ok so

142
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,500
they as an organization they actively

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,200
develop these tools give them away for

144
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,850
free they also support other open-source

145
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,250
tooling so for the things that they use

146
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,590
right or the things that help them in

147
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,240
their daily job they also support those

148
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,010
not just by using them but also by

149
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,450
marketing them telling people about them

150
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,800
including in their training courses and

151
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,780
even in some cases financially they

152
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,340
donate to the cause even when

153
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,799
open-source tool developers don't ask

154
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,359
for any money there are organizations

155
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,860
out there that will say you know it

156
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,080
they've helped me a lot I'm gonna give

157
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,610
money back to them through their you

158
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,700
know their buy a coffee link or whatever

159
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:37,460
thing maybe PayPal whatever it is this

160
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,460
organization understands that satisfied

161
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,700
employees make satisfied customers an

162
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,200
example that really stands out to me as

163
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,260
an example of this this hypothetical

164
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,909
consultancy here is I was at a I had an

165
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,330
opportunity to go back and be a part of

166
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:57,140
a an annual party for a company that I

167
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,280
once worked for and and at one point I'm

168
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,450
the owner of the company brought all the

169
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,710
people together then the families were

170
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,390
there and everything so it was really it

171
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,739
was a really really good wholesome

172
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,940
family environment and the owner they

173
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,400
pulled everybody together said hey look

174
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,230
we did really well this year we made a

175
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,880
whole bunch of money you know and was

176
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,590
very transparent in literally giving

177
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,990
numbers right we made X number of

178
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,880
dollars more than we expected to this

179
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,760
year and yes everybody gets bonuses and

180
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,230
and yada yada yada but I've decided that

181
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,520
instead of trying to take this money and

182
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,960
try to do something to bolster

183
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,789
technology at the company or add a new

184
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,830
thing or do this or that or find ways to

185
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,710
spend it and so that we can reduce our

186
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,270
tax overhead or whatever it is just gave

187
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,950
it away said look I'm giving it to you

188
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,960
guys I'm giving it back to the employees

189
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,520
that make our customers happy because

190
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,900
our customers are the ones that are

191
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,549
paying us to do this work and you're the

192
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,960
ones that are making them happy I'm

193
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,790
cutting everybody a check and these

194
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,090
checks were not small we're talking

195
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,980
four fives digits to these individuals

196
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,570
and this was in addition to bonuses that

197
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,340
were already going to be paid based on

198
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,200
performance and so on and so forth and

199
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,280
so that kind of thing just speaks to me

200
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,409
and says hey this guy company

201
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,030
understands satisfied employees make

202
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,470
satisfied customers and they went the

203
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,210
extra mile to ensure that their

204
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,800
companies were or not certain that the

205
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,710
company's but they're their employees

206
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,300
were we're well taken care of companies

207
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,469
that use race to the throttle work

208
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,620
there's a lot of different reasons

209
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:14,300
you'll see rates change but in this

210
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,520
particular case I've seen organizations

211
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,040
that will well not just raise rates

212
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,380
because they can but they'll raise rates

213
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,630
because in a lot of cases they can't and

214
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,610
by can't I mean they can't satisfy the

215
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,810
amount of work that's coming in and that

216
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,010
they got a good reputation they get a

217
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,180
lot of folks coming in but they don't

218
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,830
feel like they can find enough skilled

219
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,780
labor to do the things that means that

220
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,310
they're being asked to do sometimes

221
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,159
they'll raise the rate in an effort to

222
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,380
reduce the backlog I'm sounds crazy

223
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,580
sounds counterintuitive but I've seen

224
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,580
that happen before as well

225
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,640
transparent use of qualified sub grand

226
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,900
subcontractors so this is this is kind

227
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,789
of important to me because I do a lot

228
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,900
I'd use a lot of subcontracting work and

229
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,200
I've also been on the other side where

230
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,380
that where I've hire subcontractors it

231
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,360
gives people an opportunity to start and

232
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,830
grow similar businesses and someone to

233
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,200
say well why on earth would I foster

234
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,430
competition the reality is there's more

235
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,469
work to be done than there are good

236
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,540
people that can do it so the more small

237
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,040
small companies more organizations that

238
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,290
can get started and get up and running

239
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,090
on the better the the better off our

240
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:18,120
industry is going to end up being in the

241
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,679
long run and also this transparent use

242
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,600
of it is being just transparent about

243
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,730
business practices right like I'm I do

244
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,920
not have such a matter expertise here so

245
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,570
I am bringing in somebody in that does

246
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,850
and I'm being transparent about that and

247
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,560
it helps lead into trust and things of

248
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,820
that sort

249
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,200
believes in quality over quantity and

250
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,430
this goes in a Lawford a lot of

251
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,450
different directions both in the things

252
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,489
that they do and the things that they

253
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,720
purchase and the random end result of

254
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,770
all that and the end result of all these

255
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,090
things is no one and no one in this

256
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,490
particular company has necessarily felt

257
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,630
the rich okay so what's the common

258
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,250
thread of all these particular bullets

259
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,710
here well I would say that they're

260
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,540
focused on a culture of giving versus a

261
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,500
culture of receiving and this is

262
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,209
something that a lot of companies I

263
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,670
think talk about and while they talk

264
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,680
about it for a while rarely does it

265
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,839
stick right rarely does this stick but

266
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,250
when it does it shows there are people

267
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,720
you can see it through your interactions

268
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,190
with that particular organization but

269
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,710
the problem with this particular

270
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,570
consultancy right here is we look at it

271
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,690
and we say wow they really suck in

272
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,550
capitalism so let's look at consultancy

273
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,380
number two here consultant number two

274
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,240
bids on any contract with cyber in the

275
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,570
title I've been the victim of this

276
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,630
myself personally I've there before pvat

277
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,940
my practical burp burp suite pro

278
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,010
advanced tactics class ever went live I

279
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,530
taught it for an organization privately

280
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,420
first is almost kind of a bait or run

281
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,860
through the course and it was a result

282
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,849
of an RFP they reached out and said hey

283
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,530
you know we would love to be the first

284
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,480
ones to do this however we have to go

285
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,370
through an RFP process yada yada yada

286
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,770
we're going to literally copy and paste

287
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,630
your description of the course into the

288
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,920
RFP so that it's like there's no way

289
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,410
anybody else can do this it's

290
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,660
proprietary information right and so

291
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,730
they they put out the the proposal and I

292
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,620
bid on it and I was really surprised to

293
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,210
get the email that said I lost a bit

294
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,130
and so I reached out to the organization

295
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,360
I said hey look you know obviously you

296
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,100
know at this point in time that I've

297
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,500
lost a bit just just want to let you

298
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,180
know that I'm a little concerned because

299
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,430
I know you what you were asking for you

300
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,050
you cared about and I'm not sure how an

301
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,810
organization can come in and bid on

302
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,579
something that is a proprietary and

303
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,989
coming from one of the individuals

304
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,100
that's known as being an expert with

305
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,930
that particular thing a subject matter

306
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,670
expert in that field by a company that

307
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:24,089
couldn't even find a website before on

308
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,500
the internet and they went back did some

309
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,550
did some investigating and of course

310
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,900
that's exactly what it was

311
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,609
somebody was literally just bidding on

312
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,660
every contract opportunity they saw come

313
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,310
across their desk they had the worst

314
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,260
library this is a real thing and this is

315
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,900
happening and of course I think we can

316
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,580
all agree that's not good for the state

317
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,470
of security it's good for the state of

318
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,260
those businesses perhaps but not for

319
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,610
security overall policy number two sells

320
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,770
any service with security in the name

321
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,450
and regularly takes on work outside its

322
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,240
core competency and I would say that one

323
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,320
in two often lead into three right

324
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,370
because when you're bidding on a bunch

325
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,740
of stuff that you don't know how to do

326
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,970
necessarily then you're going to have to

327
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,970
take on work that you're not really

328
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,100
qualified to do either so there's that

329
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,600
bowl number four bills above market rate

330
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,950
because of company or individual name

331
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,020
recognition well this doesn't sound

332
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,820
wrong right but I've seen a lot of

333
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,439
organizations do this is if the person

334
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,029
with name recognition that name

335
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,130
recognition that Rockstar is the one

336
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:17,189
doing all the work I have literally seen

337
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,680
proposals from companies that always

338
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,330
include the bio of the rock star even if

339
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,800
that company never intended for that

340
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,720
particular person to fulfill that

341
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,790
contract but they sell it as if that

342
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,350
person is and I believe we call that in

343
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,610
business the bait-and-switch right

344
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,040
that's the InfoSec version of bait and

345
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,430
switch hey rock stars gonna do this not

346
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,620
really

347
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,910
okay maybe when you're in a chat channel

348
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,450
when we hop on a phone call and do an

349
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,640
email

350
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,560
rockstars present that person didn't do

351
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,029
the work because it's impossible for

352
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,420
them to do everything that these

353
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:47,550
organizations are taking in for work the

354
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,439
next one bills the same inflated rate

355
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,329
for the both the rock star from Bullitt

356
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,140
for as well as the senior and junior

357
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,140
analysts

358
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,990
I would ask people to raise hands if I

359
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,849
could see you right but have you ever

360
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,860
seen a consultancy that paid that that

361
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,990
asked for a different rate for rock star

362
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,490
X versus college grad Y now I would

363
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:08,210
imagine those exist I would imagine

364
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,970
there has to be tiered to your tiered

365
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,380
rates or tiered offerings and some

366
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,790
organizations I've just not seen that

367
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,920
happen I've seen it talked about

368
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,390
I've not seen an organization do it but

369
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,189
there is a big difference between the

370
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,380
quality of the product write a better

371
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,750
assay a better assets gonna get paid

372
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,310
more okay so they justify that higher

373
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,840
rate but all too often what we see is

374
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,180
that inflated rate that that person is

375
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,770
justified to bring in is actually

376
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,270
applied universally and that's done for

377
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,699
a lot of different reasons most of it to

378
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,170
not be transparent okay so this is a big

379
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,840
problem and it's a problem that's that's

380
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,880
of scale right and fed by demand there

381
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,110
simply aren't enough people to do the

382
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,420
amount of work that's available in our

383
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,340
industry and to do it well so the bigger

384
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,170
consulting firm gets the more people

385
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,600
they need the more competitive hiring

386
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,610
gets the lower the skilled talent pool

387
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,130
becomes for that organization and the

388
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,720
skilled talent pool grows before the

389
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,120
industry as a whole is growing slower

390
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,310
than the attack surface itself so the

391
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,650
impact is that a company grows talent

392
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,109
pool gets watered down overhead costs

393
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,540
grow but the quality goes down and the

394
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,700
rates go up

395
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,380
okay now this demand then leads to the

396
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,670
temptation to satisfy all comers which

397
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:18,300
goes back to these top three bullets

398
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:19,709
here right and these do

399
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,300
they're saying here that simply can't

400
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,470
provide a quality product when this is

401
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,479
happening so the end result is

402
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,760
watered-down security for the consumer

403
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,010
at the same on a higher pre rup same or

404
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,450
higher premium rate and the worst part

405
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,860
is if this consumer doesn't know any

406
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,450
better and believes that they're

407
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,970
continuing to receive a quality product

408
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:38,670
based on either brand or past

409
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,100
performance and to me it's just doesn't

410
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,439
seem right but I'll get into that here

411
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,120
in just a moment so the next one that

412
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,950
seeks PC capital funding of our exact

413
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,840
position is this not the American Dream

414
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,360
right to get bought out by millions of

415
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,100
dollars and retire at the age of 35 okay

416
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,080
so the temptation of base taking that

417
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,210
big payday is where it gets tricky for

418
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,530
companies with good intentions like if

419
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,820
you have bad intentions it doesn't get

420
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,770
tricky this is exactly what you're out

421
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,940
for but if you have good intentions it

422
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,189
can get tricky here because once

423
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,260
investors get involved things can go

424
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,170
very quickly from model number one to

425
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,180
model number two do people come become

426
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,920
rich that way absolutely they do but

427
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,959
often they become rich at the cost of

428
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,599
the community and the people that both

429
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,600
trusted them and trusted in their vision

430
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,220
okay so in contrast to the previous

431
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,170
example what's the common thread and all

432
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,120
these bullets right here well to me is a

433
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,500
clear focus on maximizing gains and

434
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,860
sometimes those gains are coming at the

435
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,780
cost of others now this even though this

436
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,160
example here is about consulting the

437
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,110
model is not unique to consulting

438
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,449
product and training vendors are equally

439
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,950
affected and InfoSec is full of people

440
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,690
in companies that are taking advantage

441
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,970
of the fact that they're citizens or

442
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,750
that they're clients all right they

443
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,760
don't know any better

444
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,980
I so rather than take responsibility and

445
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,460
help our clients understand right these

446
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:56,340
organizations are capitalizing on lack

447
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,110
of knowledge right with this company

448
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:01,530
consultancy number two this company

449
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:03,030
excels a capitalism okay now while these

450
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,100
bullets are synonymous with what many

451
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:07,199
would consider capitalism and properly

452
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,160
functioning capitalism I'm going to

453
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,140
spend the rest of this presentation

454
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,449
making the argument that this is the

455
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,160
result of capitalism done wrong done due

456
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,320
to the greed of man and not to the core

457
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,350
tenets of what capitalism was founded to

458
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,660
be so we'll start that argument now okay

459
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,480
and I'll start it by

460
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,030
briefly defining what not what I think

461
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,430
capitalism is but what capitalism is

462
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:32,040
okay shedding some light on the origin

463
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,959
of it so here at bolt number one Google

464
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,550
defines capitalism as a system in which

465
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,500
a country's trade and industry are

466
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,569
controlled by private owners for profit

467
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,520
rather than by state okay so it's pretty

468
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,810
straightforward our Constitution gives

469
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,540
us the freedom to buy and sell property

470
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,729
for the purpose of profit now does that

471
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,890
mean that profit is the ultimate goal or

472
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,530
does that mean that profit should be the

473
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,120
sole focus but let's look at this next

474
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,530
bullet here and this is a warning from

475
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,630
the authors of our Constitution this

476
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,490
one's specifically from John Adams and

477
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:01,320
you can read this whole paragraph and

478
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,810
come back to read it or do it now as I'm

479
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,760
speaking but ultimately if they all are

480
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,199
speeding into these two bolded

481
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,550
statements right here I'm gonna read to

482
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,890
these bold statements the first one is

483
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,109
we have no government armed with power

484
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,630
capable of contending with human

485
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:18,000
passions unbridled by morality and

486
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:21,360
religion and the second one is our

487
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,420
Constitution was made only for a morale

488
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,130
a moral and religious people it is

489
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,729
wholly inadequate to the government of

490
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,740
any other

491
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,720
okay so what does this mean for our

492
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,580
definition of capitalism at the people

493
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,510
that wrote the Constitution are telling

494
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:39,750
us that morality and religion are really

495
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,670
important to the use of this

496
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:46,320
Constitution which governs and gives us

497
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:48,089
this capitalism so morality comes from

498
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,010
religion right so these these these two

499
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,020
particular terms here are pretty closely

500
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,420
tied together and and most of the world

501
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,189
religions share a common thread I went

502
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,660
like yeah as I was thinking about this

503
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,400
reading this thing I gotta find this

504
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,660
comment that this morality and religion

505
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,490
is so important of the proper

506
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,230
implementation is capitalism then what's

507
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,670
the common thread here and the common

508
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,170
thread that I can I've been able to find

509
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,360
and not all world religions but the

510
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:11,850
major ones we're talking about Islam or

511
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:15,149
talk about Christianity Judaism is love

512
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,560
love is a common thread there and and so

513
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,970
it got me thinking you know if I were

514
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,490
sitting in a room here and I said who

515
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,470
here has heard the words uttered before

516
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,030
love your neighbors as yourself or do

517
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,250
unto others as you would have them do

518
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,899
unto you right the golden rule I think I

519
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,880
would see almost every single hand go up

520
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,200
and while these are actually religious

521
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,060
concepts in a matter of fact they're

522
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,370
pretty much verbatim from Bible text

523
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,080
they are shared across many religions

524
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,090
across the world and recognized by

525
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,860
society as a whole even a non-religious

526
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,409
society recognizes these particular

527
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,389
things so my point is is that even if

528
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,190
Adams was referring to Christianity here

529
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,870
as the implied religion the point

530
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,940
doesn't actually change when we include

531
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,280
others or just include societal norms

532
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,980
some sort of religion or moral conscious

533
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,840
is required to navigate the rights that

534
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,580
our Constitution affords and that

535
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,419
Constitution includes this idea of

536
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,580
capitalism

537
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,620
okay so capitalism is described by our

538
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,270
founding fathers as being tied to

539
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,949
morality which stems from religion and

540
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,629
the majority of world religions and

541
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,610
societal norms share a common thread of

542
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,050
loving your fellow man then the next

543
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,870
step toward better understanding

544
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,970
capitalism as I was going through this

545
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:21,510
was better understanding what exactly is

546
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:23,580
love okay so what is love and no I'm not

547
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,410
talking about that hit song from the 90s

548
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,790
okay that's the head of course that's

549
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,860
not what I'm I hear I mean another

550
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,960
another kind of humorous point is I

551
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,120
believe I could be the first person in

552
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,309
the history of security conferences to

553
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,260
actually divine and talk about love in a

554
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:39,000
talk right especially a keynote so this

555
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,210
is I will gladly wear that banner by the

556
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,860
way so feel free to label me as that but

557
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:47,340
bottom line is love is love is really

558
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:49,500
difficult to define okay I think where I

559
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,760
got from most places with some variation

560
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,090
of this first bullet here right a

561
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,150
complex series of feelings and emotions

562
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:58,470
towards another thing okay but it's

563
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,030
really difficult to define and the

564
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,370
definitions are all over the place and

565
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,870
so what we see the world religions which

566
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,309
I had that common thread of love what

567
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,500
they do is is they they don't actually

568
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:08,790
aren't able to define it either so what

569
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,190
they do is they actually take and they

570
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,110
try to say what love looks like give

571
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,000
examples so that we have an idea or an

572
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,189
image or visual of what this thing

573
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,440
called love is so Quran with regards to

574
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,320
love says that Allah is with those Allah

575
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,140
loves those who are of service to others

576
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,639
the Bible goes in great depth talking

577
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,380
about love and in these particular two

578
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,210
passages here its patient and kind

579
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,280
doesn't end beer boast it's not arrogant

580
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,870
or rude doesn't assist its own way it's

581
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,970
not terrible or resentful it doesn't

582
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,979
rejoice at wrongdoing rejoices in the

583
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,480
truth bears all things believes all

584
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,160
things hopes all things endures all

585
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,929
thing and that there's no greater love

586
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,990
than laying down your life for a friend

587
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:49,110
and so and so basically what we have

588
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:51,330
here is love boiling down to service

589
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:54,178
sacrifice and a reduction of self for

590
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,678
the good of others so let's bring all of

591
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,630
this stuff together if the founding

592
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,450
fathers design capitalism for a moral

593
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,309
and religious people and the major world

594
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,190
religions in society a whole find them

595
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:07,350
by finding their basis in love and if

596
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,500
love looks like a reduction of self for

597
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:12,870
the good of others then which business

598
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,700
examples for example consultancy one or

599
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,610
consultancy two sounds more like

600
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,559
capitalism now I would certainly make

601
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,418
the argument that kept that in

602
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,100
consulting number one appears to be

603
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,960
excelling at capitalism why Consol's e

604
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,860
number two appears to be sucking to

605
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,290
capitalism okay so this thought exercise

606
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,219
led me full circle back to the key note

607
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,409
that I gave in

608
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,390
besides Greenville 2017 that Mike spoke

609
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,370
of earlier and the talk was called

610
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:41,280
infamous InfoSec proverbs the Tim domes

611
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,570
top ten and basically what I did was is

612
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,460
I just wanted to put together you know

613
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,110
the top ten lessons I have learned

614
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,669
whether it be about business about

615
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,840
technical stuff about personal

616
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:51,419
development professional development

617
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,889
whatever this is my that was my first

618
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,780
time ever doing a keynote I felt

619
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,010
hopefully out of place just like I do

620
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,360
right now because I'm much more

621
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,280
technical than I am anything else

622
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,280
definitely not a thought later by any

623
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,480
means but I just wanted to kind of like

624
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,830
just throw those things out there hey

625
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,330
these are some things I could share with

626
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,220
people that are looking for mentorship

627
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,899
so I created a I created a talk around

628
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,640
that and number seven of that particular

629
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,080
list was it is better to give than to

630
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,120
receive and the point that I was trying

631
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,220
to make is that pretty much applies to

632
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,020
everything that that that I've been a

633
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,169
part of and everything that we do within

634
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,570
a mistake industry I mean mentorship

635
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:26,760
software training workshops seminars

636
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,960
conference talks whatever all right I

637
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,520
don't give you some examples of those

638
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,220
let's look at let's look at mentorship

639
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,770
if everyone's giving mentorship then

640
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,750
who's receiving mentorship everyone

641
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,760
right same thing goes for like service

642
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,040
if everybody's serving everybody then

643
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,720
who's being served everyone right this

644
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,340
is actually a biblical concept but once

645
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,960
again it does not require being a

646
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,939
follower of Jesus to understand that

647
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,970
this just feels right if we are all

648
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,860
giving then everyone is receiving okay

649
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,809
point number two like this the software

650
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,879
here giving away software like recon

651
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:58,620
Angie has done more for my career and my

652
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,210
quality of life than selling it ever

653
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,899
would add it has led to countless job

654
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:06,080
opportunities it has it has

655
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,700
I've probably been 80% of the

656
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,230
development skills that I have acquired

657
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,180
over the years have come from my

658
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:13,280
continuous development of that project

659
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:16,580
and rewriting it over and over again

660
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,740
um a quick story about that early on

661
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,449
within within the development of that of

662
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,610
Africana Angie I had folks come to me

663
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:25,010
actually corner me at a conference and

664
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,530
say hey look you know we're developing

665
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,910
open source intelligence gathering tools

666
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,770
and we're looking to make them

667
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,330
subscription-based but you're giving

668
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,770
away something that directly competes

669
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,949
and in many cases is better than what

670
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,850
we're doing and it's not fair or

671
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,470
necessarily fair but they were angry

672
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,050
about that they didn't like the fact

673
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,840
that I was doing it I was preventing

674
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,419
them from capitalizing on a me that they

675
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,159
saw that others had and as I look back

676
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,690
at that guy was years ago I think recon

677
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,480
Angie came out in 2014 this may have

678
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,880
been 2014 or 15 when this happened I

679
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,970
often wonder where are those individuals

680
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,520
now not because I'm putting myself on a

681
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,890
pedestal because but because I really

682
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,920
wonder because I see what giving it away

683
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,890
did for me in my career and I wonder if

684
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:13,460
what what attempting to sell it did for

685
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:15,680
theirs and so I really wonder where I

686
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,480
wouldn't be if I hadn't and I wonder

687
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,700
where they are where they had and I

688
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,560
think it'd be an interesting contrast to

689
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,880
see the differences based on one based

690
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,429
on giving and the other one based on

691
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,840
receiving and then the third third point

692
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,440
I'll make here is is giving away

693
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,669
training

694
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,200
all right things like giving away

695
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,190
training giving away workshops going and

696
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,830
speaking at a conference and not

697
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,780
expecting to be paid for that right that

698
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,090
not only helps others but it also builds

699
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,379
a personal brand right and it forces you

700
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,780
to become a subject matter expert at

701
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,980
something I don't I don't know that

702
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,940
there's too many people that say you

703
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,860
know I'm gonna go to a conference to

704
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,080
talk about this and then never prepare

705
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,429
I'm sure it's happened but most people

706
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,750
know most people they want to get up and

707
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,250
speak about something they're going to

708
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,740
work at becoming a subject matter expert

709
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,960
in that area and so as a result of that

710
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,120
as a result of that you build your own

711
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,560
professional skill set you build your

712
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,600
personal brand all these things work

713
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,770
together and you're giving right you're

714
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,060
going out there and you're doing it

715
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,770
because you want to help other people

716
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,870
and it ends up benefiting you in the

717
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,550
long run now these examples here are

718
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:13,189
based on the individual but they apply

719
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:15,110
to businesses as well the problem is is

720
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,730
there are a lot of organizations and a

721
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,830
lot of individuals that break this

722
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,799
chain of selflessness not selfishness

723
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,990
the selflessness and what this does is

724
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:26,240
it contaminates our our it contaminates

725
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,919
the society within our industry and it

726
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,960
arose at the very principles that

727
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,309
capitalism was founded other abated

728
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,530
found it under based on the things that

729
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:35,270
we've talked about so as I looked for

730
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,940
examples of areas where there are clear

731
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:39,590
problems with this me culture versus the

732
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,179
weak culture in our industry I landed on

733
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,770
four different problems and I want to

734
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,790
dip our toe in each of these and talk a

735
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,100
little bit more about the motivation

736
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,649
behind them and how I see it affecting

737
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,500
our industry and these four problems are

738
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:52,660
manipulation of recognized standards

739
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,679
restriction of open source tooling

740
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,080
training price gouging or the price

741
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,850
gouging of training pen tests puppy

742
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,678
mills which has been long since talked

743
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,570
about I'm interested and just kind of go

744
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,610
into the motivation behind each of these

745
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,950
things okay so the first part I want to

746
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,809
talk about is standards making standards

747
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,870
manipulation and the example that comes

748
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:13,910
to mind is the OAuth top 10 in 2017 so

749
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:16,189
for those of you that aren't aware the

750
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,660
Olaf top 10 most of you should be aware

751
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,120
with the OWASP top 10 is because as far

752
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,370
as web application security goes this is

753
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,709
some kind of sets the standard for where

754
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:26,360
all of our assessments start like when

755
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,299
you when you do web application security

756
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,100
assessments the top ten are the minimum

757
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:34,010
baseline of what you should be looking

758
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,020
for and looking at and focusing on so in

759
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,190
2017 this particular list was delayed

760
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,500
and it gets released every couple of

761
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,179
years and a cycle delayed several months

762
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,100
and it was delayed because the tract

763
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:44,900
included a really questionable entry

764
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,480
okay so what was questioned about that

765
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,490
entry well it turns out that the waffle

766
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,020
leadership had corporate involvement

767
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,400
with a particular organization meaning

768
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,559
that a wasa leadership worked for a

769
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,870
particular organization that released a

770
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:01,790
product that particular year that

771
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:04,520
focused on solving the problem that this

772
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:07,899
new entry presented okay so there was a

773
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,549
ton of there was it essentially the the

774
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,049
list itself directly supported a

775
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:14,210
conflict of interest for the leadership

776
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:15,918
of the organization that released it

777
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,919
based on corporate involvement that they

778
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,120
had with private companies and so

779
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,410
luckily in this particular guy mean

780
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,059
obviously that's it that's it that's a

781
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,679
conflict of interest right so luckily

782
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:27,020
the industry actually stood up right the

783
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:29,230
industry stood up called them out and

784
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,120
and they went back and

785
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,410
they pulled in some some outside people

786
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,090
they read through the analysis and

787
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:35,530
rereleased it out ten a couple months

788
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,649
later so things were fixed but the

789
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:40,750
bottom line is a manipulation of the top

790
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,040
10 could have had far-reaching effects I

791
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,570
mean think about it causing the

792
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,980
community to emphasize on something that

793
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,600
wasn't crucial as it seen while

794
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,480
downgrading the emphasis on something

795
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,129
that was the the the impact of that is

796
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,650
essentially untold it's impossible to

797
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,150
calculate that but think of potential

798
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,440
compromise they could have happened as a

799
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,450
result of that since people weren't

800
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,670
looking for it all these vulnerabilities

801
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,490
could have potentially gone unseen or

802
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:05,560
unchecked run unmitigated I mean I don't

803
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,320
need to I think go much further here to

804
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,639
realize that that's just wrong okay but

805
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,409
why did they do it what was the

806
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,150
motivation well the motivation here was

807
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,970
clearly to capitalize on a position of

808
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,980
power for personal financial gain and at

809
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,660
the same time sacrifice the security of

810
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:23,200
a whole bunch of people essentially

811
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,640
everyone to do that so the second

812
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,590
problem here is restricting open source

813
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,940
tooling now this really appears to be a

814
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,860
noble effort okay it's a noble effort

815
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,020
that makes two main arguments an

816
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:36,040
argument number one is that bad actor

817
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:38,560
capability is more important or more

818
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,780
impactful than universal knowledge

819
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,970
excuse me all of that capability

820
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,170
okay now the original paper spends most

821
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,180
of the time making this particular

822
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,720
argument and it claims to use facts that

823
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:51,190
support this point but it provides very

824
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,140
essentially zero supporting evidence now

825
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,270
I expected as I read through this thing

826
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,980
to see links and to see references and

827
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,750
all kinds of stuff because person's

828
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,900
throwing out a lot of facts and making

829
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,860
sweeping assumptions and I didn't see

830
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,510
and there's no links in there there's

831
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,459
just no links to third party information

832
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,600
which tells me that that information is

833
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,860
coming from internal whether it's

834
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,389
internal to him or internal an

835
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,429
organization that kind of information is

836
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,800
coming from somewhere but it's

837
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,480
definitely not coming from a third party

838
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:20,350
resource that that particular person is

839
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,000
willing to point out so for instance

840
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:23,919
here I mean some of the flaws log that

841
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,330
goes that's gone into this thing the

842
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,100
author says that bad actors should be

843
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,840
forced to invest in a capability in

844
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,669
order to have it and that an effective

845
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,949
way to prevent them from possessing it

846
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:35,800
is preventing public release of that

847
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,990
capability so so my question to that is

848
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,730
what happens if a bad actor is willing

849
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,620
to invest the capital and the time into

850
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,090
developing a capability that that we

851
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,699
have that we have disclosed

852
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,260
from public release all that does is it

853
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,360
creates a gap it doesn't actually get

854
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,340
rid of any bad actors but it creates a

855
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,379
gap between the haves and the have-nots

856
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,939
okay there are still going to be the

857
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,800
hats they're still going to be threats

858
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,890
there but the problem is is the good

859
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,800
guys go from being fully aware to being

860
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,910
virtually completely kept in the dark

861
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,780
and I actually look at this and say well

862
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,430
if you're going to make that argument

863
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:10,180
the same argument can actually be made

864
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:11,680
for the way to be made to to to say that

865
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,480
we should no longer provide security

866
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,040
patches for unpublished vulnerabilities

867
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,990
and I say unpublishable mobility

868
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,550
specifically because the release of

869
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:21,010
patches for unpublished vulnerabilities

870
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:24,100
gives bad actors now the ability to

871
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:25,540
reverse engineer and div software right

872
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,030
to find the patched issue and then

873
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,889
create exploits for sono patches would

874
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,720
restrict their capability right and that

875
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:34,150
seems to be more important the knowledge

876
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,530
of those issues so if the benefit

877
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,090
outweighs the risk with regards to

878
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,800
security patching then why not with

879
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,740
tooling and so that's as some of the

880
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,300
logic that you kind of see there and now

881
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,800
argument number two is actually a really

882
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,659
good argument right no by there's no

883
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,240
viable justification for obtaining raw

884
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,860
offensive capability pseudo anonymously

885
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,480
I can get Tyco and totally get on board

886
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,490
with this as somebody that releases open

887
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,080
source tools if an author is willing to

888
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,610
associate themselves with the tool if

889
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,159
I'm willing to say I wrote this thing

890
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:01,780
then the users of that tool should be

891
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,850
okay with saying that they're using that

892
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,410
particular thing I can get on I can get

893
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,750
on board with it so so it's not a

894
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:09,910
hundred percent bad argument I mean it's

895
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,470
not 100 percent bad idea and it

896
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,870
certainly appears to be a noble effort

897
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,220
but what is the motivation you heard me

898
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,780
kind of allude to it a little bit where

899
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,770
I was saying there was no information

900
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,120
that he didn't point to any public

901
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,400
information that most of it probably

902
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,040
came from internal and as I looked a

903
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,540
little bit closer I found now that the

904
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,250
person that's driving this movement

905
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,620
works for a company that would greatly

906
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,270
benefit from any implementation of this

907
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,250
idea all right they're one of the

908
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,330
marquee names for all the kind of stuff

909
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,040
the information that would feed into

910
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:38,470
this and one of the marquee names for an

911
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,200
organization that would implement or

912
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:44,050
assist in any type of legal regulation

913
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,560
of that stuff they would be someone that

914
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,060
the government turned to to do this and

915
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,770
so I am making an assumption here

916
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,750
completely this is I totally don't know

917
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,370
this is fact but it certainly appears to

918
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,280
me that this movement here could be

919
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,409
motivated by a desire to capital

920
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,720
in a way that hampers many of us

921
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:02,310
operationally while greatly benefiting a

922
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,830
few financially whether it's done for

923
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:07,470
noble whether there is a nobility behind

924
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:09,540
it or not what is the motivation here

925
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,760
now unlike the the OWASP issue this

926
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,050
one's not resolved ok there are some

927
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,060
neutral resources out there where you

928
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,290
can try to view some arguments overview

929
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,970
the various arguments that are being

930
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:19,230
made to make a decision yourself

931
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:20,880
I got a link you're the one that's

932
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:23,550
coming online in a couple of days this

933
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,170
is not me right I am not running this

934
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:27,090
the person that is is somebody that I

935
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:29,940
think is is it very middle-of-the-road

936
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:32,340
person tends to not get involved in in

937
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,890
in drama but really cares about the

938
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,230
truth and making good decisions as an

939
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:38,850
industry and so I'm willing to put this

940
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,560
link here but I just want to make it

941
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,550
clear that I am not the one that is

942
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,020
building this for putting this

943
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:46,560
information together and I'll let that

944
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:48,570
person I'll let that person reveal

945
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,580
themselves when and if they release this

946
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:53,780
thing if they choose to do so I will not

947
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:56,040
I will not name any names like I said

948
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,720
for the third issue and this one really

949
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,120
hits close to home for me is training

950
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,530
price gouging and the reason why it hits

951
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,879
close to home for me is because this is

952
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:05,460
this is my passion

953
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,020
I love teaching people about the things

954
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,780
that I know and if a second the things

955
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,639
that I've learned and in fact I built my

956
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,500
company around it and I say my company

957
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,840
it's just me right it's me with an LLC

958
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,670
but it but it is a company built around

959
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,820
training and if I ever grow it will be

960
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:22,110
to train I also do some other things on

961
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,460
the side but I'm a training company so

962
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,490
this is close to home and so what I did

963
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:30,450
was I went out and I tried to build a

964
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:32,520
table here of the average daily price of

965
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,080
training for various organizations for

966
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,450
various providers now these providers

967
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,460
are generally highly rated you can find

968
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,170
negative negative feedback pretty much

969
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,920
anywhere with the exception of practice

970
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:45,030
SEC just kidding right that's funny no

971
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,080
seriously that that's my company all

972
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,510
right and so of course I'm including

973
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,159
myself for transparency here you could

974
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:51,720
absolutely find negative reviews for any

975
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,430
of these but these are all generally

976
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,140
considered to provide highly rated

977
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,490
training I mean it is based on an

978
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,020
eight-hour day too which is why some of

979
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,580
these numbers look a little bit a little

980
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,430
bit funny because there are

981
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,409
organizations that teach for our work or

982
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:07,380
you know three-day workshops 4 hours a

983
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,910
day and so that you have to kind of do

984
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,950
some math with the hours but ultimately

985
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,980
8 hour

986
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:15,679
days so blackhat 2019 or and they had

987
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:19,580
visitor pricing for blackhat 2019 $1,250

988
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:22,070
to $2,000 a day Black Hills InfoSec $198

989
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,449
a day now I have zero here because black

990
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,740
deals recently came out and said hey if

991
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,360
you can't afford to take the training

992
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,760
we'll give it to you for free

993
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,469
so obviously that seriously reduces the

994
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,990
daily price but I went with what they're

995
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:35,149
listed prices which I think was 395 days

996
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:38,120
for a four day workshop that was a total

997
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:40,428
of 16 hours my price is standard across

998
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,489
the board $500 per person per day

999
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:47,600
regardless of whether it's on site open

1000
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:48,830
open enrollment whatever sans is 1170

1001
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,139
dollars a day now science is the only

1002
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,970
one that might not be exact and that's

1003
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:54,229
not because you know I I want to fudge

1004
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,250
these numbers to make them look bad or

1005
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,929
anything like that it's because every

1006
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,610
time I go there and I check the prices

1007
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:00,649
they're actually higher than it was

1008
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:02,240
before and so there's a good chance that

1009
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:03,559
they may have actually gone up since I

1010
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,000
collected this information even though

1011
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:06,769
it was only like three to five days ago

1012
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,829
I just want to make sure I throw that

1013
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:11,210
caveat out there Specter offs pretty

1014
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:12,409
much thousand bucks across the board on

1015
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,418
all the classes that I could see that

1016
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:16,730
we're listed upcoming and trust his sex

1017
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:19,520
same thing about $750 okay so why is

1018
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:21,020
this information is important okay so I

1019
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,699
went and I did a little survey on

1020
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,109
Twitter this past week and asked a

1021
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:26,328
question how much are you willing to

1022
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:28,129
spend out-of-pocket per day for decent

1023
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:29,419
training and here I specify not the best

1024
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:30,879
but something relevant that will make

1025
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:33,408
you marginally better at your craft

1026
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,598
without being reimbursed this is a

1027
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:37,069
really tough question to ask and it's a

1028
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,839
tough question to answer because it's

1029
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:40,790
extremely subjective well how many days

1030
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:42,649
is it right rich people versus poor

1031
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,719
people so I'm so there's there's a lot

1032
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:46,250
of subjectivity that goes into this but

1033
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,368
ultimately I was just trying to get

1034
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:52,460
enough data to make this point and I

1035
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:54,319
think I did okay regardless of where the

1036
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,290
statistical anomalies may be and how you

1037
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:59,390
could maybe draw some draw some

1038
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,810
conclusions from ninety percent of

1039
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,118
people

1040
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,730
ninety percent of people are willing or

1041
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:08,030
can't or aren't willing or can't spend

1042
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:10,490
or won't spend over five hundred dollars

1043
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:12,020
a day for training so what does this say

1044
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,490
about the providers on the previous

1045
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,980
slide well it says that they're

1046
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:19,540
explicitly targeting big-money customers

1047
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:21,770
right government's large companies right

1048
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,569
they're not interested in helping

1049
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,810
individuals that are interested in

1050
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:25,730
health

1051
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,680
people they're interested in batting

1052
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:30,050
their pockets by supporting clients with

1053
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,700
a lot of money and so what does this do

1054
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,350
for our industry well it creates a

1055
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,660
barrier to entry and a barrier to

1056
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,770
improve of all of course increasing

1057
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,600
increasing profits for those

1058
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,950
organizations now this problem and this

1059
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,990
is what really grace me and really

1060
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:43,970
irritates me this problem is amplified

1061
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:46,549
when you apply the fact that the people

1062
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:48,500
that need the training are less skilled

1063
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:51,500
and because they're less skilled are

1064
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,150
less likely to be paid enough money to

1065
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,310
afford the inflated prices that are

1066
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,650
being asked to be spent this is a huge

1067
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:59,090
problem all the problems I think we're

1068
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,070
covering here I think this is the

1069
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,150
biggest and it's certainly the one that

1070
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,620
grates me the most you could probably

1071
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,870
tell by the level of passion in this

1072
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,640
particular segment has gone up in my

1073
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,500
talk because this bothers me this

1074
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,470
affects me I know it if it would have

1075
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,940
affected me greatly if I wasn't

1076
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,770
privileged coming up and having people

1077
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,500
that pulled me through the through the

1078
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,540
industry and and set me up with great

1079
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,950
training Department of the Army is a big

1080
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,330
part of that right I didn't pay for all

1081
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,490
the training I got it came from them

1082
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:27,980
right that was a privilege that they

1083
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:30,560
afforded me not everybody has that and

1084
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,710
and and so and so that being said this

1085
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,140
just it's a problem it's a problem that

1086
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:37,340
we got to deal with okay and the last

1087
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,629
one that I want to talk about is pen

1088
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,240
test Buffy Mills and this one has

1089
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:43,550
obviously been they talk about a lot

1090
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,200
over recent years it's a twist on

1091
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,180
example number two but in this case the

1092
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,580
result was inflated prices making the

1093
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,100
service inaccessible to small and medium

1094
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,600
bise's whereas medium businesses where

1095
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,370
pen test puppy mills actually have the

1096
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,589
opposite effect which I'll get into here

1097
00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:00,560
in just a moment they prey on a lack of

1098
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:02,180
knowledge versus individual brands okay

1099
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,140
so they're not praying here on rockstar

1100
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,669
brands they're playing and they're

1101
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,609
preying on a lack of knowledge of the

1102
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,660
clientele so and that's not 100 percent

1103
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,250
of what they do but it's a part of what

1104
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,649
they do because quality is never really

1105
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,390
intended with with with a pen test puppy

1106
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:17,000
mill right there's very little concern

1107
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:18,529
for quality and in frankly individual

1108
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,330
name recognition right that Rockstar

1109
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,800
thing that I was mentioning these

1110
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,900
companies take advantage of weak

1111
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,840
regulatory requirements things like PCI

1112
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,520
things that are like well you can be

1113
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,020
compliant but you're not necessarily

1114
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,090
secure and they provide a solution for

1115
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,009
that check the box security mentality

1116
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:36,860
which frankly a lot of organizations

1117
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,700
have they sell these services with a

1118
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,140
sense of confidence

1119
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,600
in providing a service that they don't

1120
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,029
actually specialize in so this also goes

1121
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,740
back similar to example number two but

1122
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:48,050
instead of being able to instead of

1123
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,479
being enabled by that brand recognition

1124
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:53,900
these pentest puppy mills are enabled by

1125
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,660
their low rates now in order to offer

1126
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:59,060
these low rates they've got to they've

1127
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,200
got to make some compromises right and

1128
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,120
we'll get to that in just a second so

1129
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,129
the undercut other firms by conducting

1130
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,069
fully automated low quality tests they

1131
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:09,320
have to conduct fully automated quality

1132
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,880
tests in order to in order to pay the

1133
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,860
people that they're paying while also

1134
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,360
providing the service at the providing

1135
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,590
at the rates that they're charging now

1136
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,150
don't get me wrong automation has this

1137
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:19,760
place right automation absolutely has

1138
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:23,570
this place but it's it's it's been long

1139
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,040
since known that these tools aren't very

1140
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,660
good right they only have the ability to

1141
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,680
find I shouldn't say they aren't very

1142
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,940
good because they're trying to do

1143
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,740
something very difficult but they only

1144
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,750
have the ability to find a very low

1145
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:34,250
percentage of actual issues that exist

1146
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,750
and depending on what part of the

1147
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:37,310
industry you're in it gets worse like

1148
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,800
find an automated tool that right

1149
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:42,950
zero-day exploits for like network

1150
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,720
services not gonna happen right or at

1151
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:47,330
least doesn't exist in any in any real

1152
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,859
good capacity now web application

1153
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:50,600
security in an environment that's

1154
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,340
changing in an environment where a

1155
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:56,020
developer can solve a problem in a

1156
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:59,210
literally an unlimited number of ways

1157
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,470
the scanner the idea of having a scanner

1158
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,570
that can find problems and all these

1159
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,520
things is darn near impossible so this

1160
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:06,110
is a very rare this is a this is a very

1161
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,580
real problem and so if you've got

1162
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,530
organizations that are undercutting

1163
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:11,480
others and then conducting these full-on

1164
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,000
fully automated test they're absolutely

1165
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,230
going to be low quality and so what you

1166
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,640
end up having is you have these things

1167
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,560
being sold with confidence and then it

1168
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,609
leaves clients with a false sense of

1169
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,230
security okay now where this becomes

1170
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,330
dangerous is for consumers that are

1171
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:28,010
hiring these companies and that actually

1172
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,569
care about the results of these tests

1173
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:31,400
because let's face it they're absolutely

1174
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,450
gonna be consumers that only want check

1175
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,890
the box stuff and they don't actually

1176
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,960
care about the results and you know what

1177
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:37,310
pen test puppy mail go for it you can

1178
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,110
service those clients I don't agree with

1179
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,340
anybody looking at security that way but

1180
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,680
the bottom line is there are people that

1181
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,420
are okay but that price point that

1182
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,069
they're able to offer is absolutely

1183
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,870
going to draw in others that don't know

1184
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,670
any better and then they're gonna be

1185
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:51,410
taken advantage of and this leads to a

1186
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,579
reduced level security for

1187
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,109
anyone associated with those

1188
00:39:52,579 --> 00:39:56,720
organizations that fall for that

1189
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:58,578
particular tag business tactic okay so

1190
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,319
so that's the four main problems and

1191
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:01,789
kind of my summarization of those there

1192
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:03,770
could be an individual talk done on each

1193
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:05,270
of these I literally just barely skim

1194
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,640
the surface of these things but I just

1195
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,990
wanted to throw those out there um so

1196
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,598
now how do we fix this problem right

1197
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,520
this this llll this we have rampant LLL

1198
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,750
apply capitalism its leading to these

1199
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,740
issues how do we fix it

1200
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:20,510
okay so solutions were providers number

1201
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:22,700
one I don't expect any leader of any

1202
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,960
company that behaves like this to

1203
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,270
actually watch this talk and take

1204
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,980
anything I say seriously right so if the

1205
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,480
site is essentially meant for those who

1206
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,950
realize they're a part of one or

1207
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,180
potentially could be moving in the

1208
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:34,129
directive of starting their own

1209
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,660
organization and being a provider of one

1210
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,859
of these services number one be

1211
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,460
transparent with your business practices

1212
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:42,470
and your competencies right if you don't

1213
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,329
do something well don't tell us don't

1214
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,368
don't tell don't tell somebody you do it

1215
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:47,930
well okay and if you have an

1216
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:49,220
organization that company says look

1217
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,990
we're looking for a one-stop shop we

1218
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:52,759
want somebody that does all these things

1219
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,589
is it not perfectly okay to be

1220
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,420
transparent with your business practices

1221
00:40:54,589 --> 00:40:59,569
and say hey you know what that's not

1222
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,520
something I do well but I will I do know

1223
00:40:59,569 --> 00:41:03,500
people and I will find a quality

1224
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,288
subcontractor or I will lean on one of

1225
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,000
my quality subcontractors to actually

1226
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:10,279
fulfill that part of the compensate a

1227
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,660
competency that we lack to give you this

1228
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:13,069
full product that you're looking for

1229
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:15,020
there's absolutely nothing wrong with

1230
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:17,390
that nothing at all but but as a

1231
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,069
subcontractor I have absolutely run into

1232
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,069
companies that just refused to let me be

1233
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:24,230
me and what's absurd about that is is

1234
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:25,759
how hard is it to say huh tim tomes i

1235
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,470
wonder where his credentials look like

1236
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,990
since he's conducting my tests google

1237
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,299
tim tomes founder of practical security

1238
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:34,578
services LLC that's not who I hired

1239
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:36,529
right so it's not even really a secret

1240
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:38,779
in most cases so why not be transparent

1241
00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:40,430
about it to begin with anyway so box all

1242
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:43,069
right so they offer different here's a

1243
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,450
surface or offer for you all four

1244
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:46,400
different tiers of service based on

1245
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,618
asset proficiency once again it makes

1246
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,299
sense if you've got a rockstar charge

1247
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,640
rockstar rates for that person they're

1248
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,930
worth more they're gonna work faster

1249
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,400
chances are they're going to be more

1250
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,779
efficient get thing done quicker but

1251
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,119
that doesn't mean that that it should be

1252
00:41:56,779 --> 00:42:01,039
the same rate as a result of that right

1253
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,420
you can up the rate for somebody that's

1254
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:03,829
going to be more efficient and a better

1255
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,330
asset that just makes sense that

1256
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:08,790
actually feeds into

1257
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:10,440
to what our founding fathers had in mind

1258
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:13,440
for capitalism there's nothing unethical

1259
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,090
about that price training so that

1260
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,220
accessible at all and this kind of goes

1261
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:19,230
into the next bullet just stop being

1262
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,750
greedy have a heart for others

1263
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:23,370
contribute to the good of everyone and

1264
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,080
you can do that by pricing training so

1265
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:27,060
that it is accessible I'm not asking you

1266
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,830
to give it away like Black Hills right

1267
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,060
in fact Black Hills you know that I saw

1268
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,920
some people saying take advantage take

1269
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,090
advantage I don't necessarily agree that

1270
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,890
you should take advantage if you have

1271
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,090
the ability to give a little more you

1272
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:38,580
have the ability to pay that three

1273
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:40,170
hundred ninety five bucks do it there's

1274
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,610
still work going into that and even

1275
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:44,220
though Black Hills isn't gonna ask you

1276
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:46,440
to if you have the ability to do it if

1277
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,910
you don't then go get you free training

1278
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,440
and and and that's a great thing that

1279
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,240
Black Hills is doing for you but

1280
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,040
ultimately just think about someone else

1281
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,660
other than yourself as you as you're

1282
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,670
doing as you're as you're embarking on

1283
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,839
this journey now I get it a lot of this

1284
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:00,330
stuff is much easier said than done

1285
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,340
right and ultimately it requires a huge

1286
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:04,799
culture change this is not going to be

1287
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,690
something that you brand new guy just

1288
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,850
got hired or intern is probably going to

1289
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:11,790
be able to change within an organization

1290
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:14,850
this definitely comes from the top but

1291
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:17,190
one of the good things about capitalism

1292
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:19,049
right is the employees and consumers we

1293
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,280
have the ability to drive change and so

1294
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,140
those are the kind of the next couple of

1295
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,000
points that I'm gonna go into so

1296
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,310
Solutions for individuals this is for us

1297
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,540
the individuals number one share your

1298
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:29,850
tools and discoveries but do it

1299
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,830
responsibly now responsibly is a loaded

1300
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:33,210
term whole another talk right on what

1301
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:35,400
responsibly means but ultimately what

1302
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,860
I'm telling you to not do is lock it

1303
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,610
away and make it inaccessible okay recon

1304
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:43,440
ng is kind of an example of that and I

1305
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:45,060
have an interests I think it may perhaps

1306
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,770
a different approach to kind of how I

1307
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,650
manage this thing responsible disclosure

1308
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:51,950
of of recon ng for me a responsible

1309
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:57,390
distribution of recon ng for me is

1310
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:59,640
making it somewhat difficult to use ah I

1311
00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:00,870
did that intentionally people ask me

1312
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,540
well why you know why do I have to know

1313
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:05,130
sequel to do this or or or why is it

1314
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,720
difficult to set up the environment or

1315
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:09,600
or why is the command structure built

1316
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,850
this way because I get hit up on issue

1317
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:16,380
tracker and and Twitter DM z-- all the

1318
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:17,490
time from a non hacker with a guide with

1319
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,900
with you know with the without with

1320
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,509
anonymous mask you know

1321
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,130
I'm trying broken English I'm trying to

1322
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:24,660
hack my friends I'm trying to doc

1323
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:27,030
somebody on Facebook can you show me how

1324
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,379
to do with recon Angie no I'm not going

1325
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,760
to show you how to do it you're not the

1326
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,590
intended audience and I'm not going to

1327
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,120
contribute to that if you want to use

1328
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,610
the tool you're going to need to invest

1329
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,130
some time and some efforts to do it now

1330
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:39,210
I'm not requiring you to invest to

1331
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:41,490
invest in such a way that you have to

1332
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,960
completely redevelop the tool but I am

1333
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,520
requiring you to invest in time to work

1334
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,900
through the learning curve and that's

1335
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,190
how I've chosen to make the distribution

1336
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:52,200
of recon ng a responsible distribution

1337
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:53,490
okay affect the culture change once

1338
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,500
again this starts at the top so if

1339
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,390
you're near it try to influence it don't

1340
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,310
sit idly by and watch our industry and

1341
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:01,200
your peers suffer for the sake of a few

1342
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,910
individuals greed don't do it you don't

1343
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,890
have to and that kind of leads into

1344
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:06,600
number three here there's more work than

1345
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:08,759
there are good people to do it and that

1346
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,860
results in a ton of opportunities if

1347
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,530
you're a valuable asset consider finding

1348
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:16,610
any job consider moving if a company

1349
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:18,840
experiences a mass exodus of talent that

1350
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:20,490
sends a pretty darn strong message to

1351
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,530
the leadership of that organization if

1352
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:26,399
anything can drive culture change that

1353
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,750
may be it for employees okay number four

1354
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,540
don't support companies that hurt the

1355
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,850
community plain and simple

1356
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:34,200
don't support them by supporting these

1357
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:36,600
companies all you're doing is in

1358
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,370
building them to make it worse so if

1359
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,960
you've identified any companies that you

1360
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,480
know and I'm sure many of you as we've

1361
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,010
gone through this talk have said

1362
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,900
organization comes to mind one two three

1363
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:47,190
Howard don't support them all right if

1364
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,380
that's an organization that you pour

1365
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,180
money into on an annual basis don't do

1366
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,440
it anymore the next slide I'm gonna

1367
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,720
cover ways that you can you can

1368
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:58,560
compensate for that but just don't do it

1369
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,029
and then the last one call it out right

1370
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,770
as an industry we're pretty good at self

1371
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:03,780
policing I would say we're pretty good

1372
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:05,550
at that making these kinds of things

1373
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,230
known and getting the word out I think

1374
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,790
goes a really long way to fixing this

1375
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,880
particular problem in fact this entire

1376
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:13,980
talk is me calling it out all right if

1377
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,540
that didn't get that didn't hit home

1378
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,430
pretty much immediately when I said that

1379
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:19,170
that's what this is this is me calling

1380
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,359
out these particular problems I see an

1381
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:26,010
issue and I want to make it known so

1382
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:27,480
that we as an organization fix it okay

1383
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:28,890
solutions for consumers what can

1384
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,120
consumers do and by consumers doing I'm

1385
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,890
talking about individuals or companies

1386
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,170
that are purchasing these services

1387
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:36,029
whether it be training whether it be

1388
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:38,130
whether it be consulting whether it be

1389
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:41,040
development support whatever number one

1390
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:43,140
avoid the one-stop shop okay one-stop

1391
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,670
shopping is super tempting right but it

1392
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,049
can cost you money in the long run and I

1393
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,060
think it'll become apparent here in just

1394
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,470
a few months some of my points to

1395
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,420
support this and why why you should do

1396
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:54,359
it small companies usually have a

1397
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,650
sharper focus okay a couple of visuals

1398
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,080
get together they're really good at a

1399
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,670
thing maybe it's exploit research maybe

1400
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,710
it's web application security whatever

1401
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:03,630
they did get together they start a small

1402
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:05,820
company a small company and then they

1403
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:07,650
hire around that one core competency in

1404
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:10,260
which that company was developed you

1405
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:13,350
have a really high average skill per

1406
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:15,120
individual of a small company you can't

1407
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:17,460
I shouldn't say that universally applies

1408
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:20,069
but it's certainly a certainly has in my

1409
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,960
experience on the other on the flipside

1410
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:23,820
large companies right as they grow

1411
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,020
they've got a higher less skilled labor

1412
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,490
because as we said multiple times

1413
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,750
there's just not enough good people out

1414
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,399
there to do the work that needs to be

1415
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,380
done and so they're gonna have to hire

1416
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,880
less skilled labor and in order to get

1417
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,380
the number of jobs done that are coming

1418
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,270
and they're gonna have to automate more

1419
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,620
and some of that automation is to take

1420
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,300
to the place is to take the place of a

1421
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,490
lack of skill so you're gonna end up

1422
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,690
with a less than average quality per

1423
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,399
engagement and what this ends up

1424
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:46,320
resulting is is you have this short-term

1425
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,000
game because guess what I'm only

1426
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,860
spending time doing one contract I'm

1427
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,110
only spending time talking to one client

1428
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:54,840
and that seems to save money now because

1429
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:56,460
some saving time but it ends up in a

1430
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,920
long-term loss and so let me give you an

1431
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,260
example as an individual as a company

1432
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,180
and as a VP of services for for another

1433
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,860
company i've lost contracts to companies

1434
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,560
that have come to me and said hey we

1435
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:09,660
want you to do X Y & Z and I just simply

1436
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,310
couldn't and when I went and when I told

1437
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,899
them I couldn't or when I told them you

1438
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:14,250
know and you know I gave them everything

1439
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,710
I've talked about here in terms of how

1440
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:18,450
we can solve that problem I advised some

1441
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:19,440
of the this stuff they chose to go

1442
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,060
somewhere else

1443
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,680
big chose to go somewhere else now it is

1444
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,660
it isn't it worth noting that I

1445
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,580
personally I refuse to do anything

1446
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:28,049
outside in my core competency and I

1447
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,000
don't do subcontracting right now so

1448
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:31,830
that as a result I simply cannot and

1449
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,480
will not satisfy these requests and and

1450
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:35,480
I feel like I need to say this because

1451
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:40,060
that if I didn't I I could be putting

1452
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:43,030
myself on the same side of the argument

1453
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:44,380
that I'm making or against it against

1454
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,100
the argument that I'm making so I want

1455
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,390
to make that clear

1456
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,740
I don't do anything outside of my core

1457
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,779
competency but in this particular case

1458
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,069
is I was open with them and I was

1459
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:53,860
transparent and say hey look we don't do

1460
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:55,660
that or I don't do that and I advised

1461
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,560
them of these particular dangers and

1462
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,899
they ended up going a different

1463
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:01,210
direction many of those companies ended

1464
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,650
up coming back at a later time and ended

1465
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,780
up paying me to do the work a second

1466
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:07,390
time when if they would have just taken

1467
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,910
the time in the first place to form

1468
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:11,620
those relationships with me for the one

1469
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:12,879
thing and then another organization for

1470
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,680
another thing oh and by the way guess

1471
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,740
what we know each other so I could have

1472
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,149
given them really really good leads into

1473
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,500
companies or small companies or

1474
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:23,080
individuals that could have done a

1475
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:25,540
fantastic stellar job for a reasonable

1476
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,680
rate with for them but they ended up

1477
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,750
coming back to paying me to do it a

1478
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,370
second time anyway so long-term loss

1479
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,410
ended up paying two or three times to

1480
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:35,259
have this done and they saved a couple

1481
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,620
of hours work early on a very real

1482
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,660
problem

1483
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:41,259
avoid the one-stop shop is tempting is

1484
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,759
it maybe in point number two kind of

1485
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:45,010
leads into that a little bit as well I

1486
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,020
build relationships with local small

1487
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:48,250
companies chances are there are some in

1488
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,440
your area that you're not even aware of

1489
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,210
I didn't really grasp this until I

1490
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,070
started going to some of the local

1491
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,500
meetups here in the Upstate area and

1492
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:58,540
realized that oh my gosh there are

1493
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:01,180
security consulting firms here there are

1494
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:03,730
really good development development

1495
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:06,430
firms here there's good local training

1496
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:08,020
in the area there's there's there's

1497
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,850
their stuff and yes it could be

1498
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,400
considered direct competition but once

1499
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:13,810
again there's more work than there is

1500
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,280
people good people that can do it so

1501
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,750
competition is a really good thing right

1502
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,670
now having more of these companies is a

1503
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:20,560
good thing I just didn't realize that

1504
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,060
that that there were that many good

1505
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,790
small companies doing these things

1506
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,650
around me and in in I think another

1507
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,910
thing that we would agree on is when

1508
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,750
you're doing work like this Trust is

1509
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:31,240
really important

1510
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,800
yeah easy it is to build trust win month

1511
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,140
after month you go to these meetings and

1512
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:38,410
you see these people you see your client

1513
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:40,150
right asking good questions in in these

1514
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,730
things you see your client showing

1515
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:44,080
concern and care and passion for the for

1516
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:46,990
the work that they're doing you see your

1517
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:49,359
client up there presenting technical or

1518
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:52,089
or or well-thought-out material

1519
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,980
it is really easy to build trust when

1520
00:50:52,089 --> 00:50:55,420
you're doing that okay and so I'm

1521
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,190
convinced that the best services you've

1522
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,720
never heard of exist here it just takes

1523
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:01,390
a little bit of time and a little bit of

1524
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,399
effort to get involved go out meets the

1525
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:04,808
people and make to have the phone calls

1526
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,640
right have the additional phone calls

1527
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:08,890
put in the extra hours of contracting to

1528
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,808
bring in these small organizations that

1529
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:12,940
are going to do really really good work

1530
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:14,559
for you and have a high average skill

1531
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,630
and oh by the way since they don't have

1532
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,819
all that overhead they're also typically

1533
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,859
cheaper I've actually had people tell me

1534
00:51:18,819 --> 00:51:22,390
I had to raise my rate because my rate

1535
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:25,630
was so low they were afraid contracting

1536
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:27,308
was gonna think I was a fraud okay no I

1537
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:28,509
just don't I don't have an office I have

1538
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:30,339
to pay for I don't have a bunch of

1539
00:51:28,509 --> 00:51:32,170
employees that I got to pay for it's

1540
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:33,549
just me I'm really good at what I do I'm

1541
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:35,950
a one-trick pony but I'm really really

1542
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:37,329
good at my trick okay and I want to do

1543
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,828
that trick for you okay

1544
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:40,720
and I'm willing to do it at a nominal

1545
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:43,029
rate and so they just don't that doesn't

1546
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,470
equate with with companies with regards

1547
00:51:43,029 --> 00:51:46,119
to modern capitalism or the way that

1548
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:48,910
we've been doing capitalism so we really

1549
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:51,130
need to kind of change that mindset okay

1550
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:53,049
so I probably way over at this point in

1551
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:54,789
time and I'm not looking at any text to

1552
00:51:53,049 --> 00:51:56,019
imagine Mike's probably screaming at me

1553
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:58,029
so I'm good let's get through this

1554
00:51:56,019 --> 00:52:00,249
conclusion here number one I'm a huge

1555
00:51:58,029 --> 00:52:01,900
proponent of capitalism true capitalism

1556
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:04,089
regardless of what this presentation

1557
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:07,329
says I have to bet has to be now and I'm

1558
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:08,769
a proponent of true capitalism I don't

1559
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:11,049
believe that change happens when you're

1560
00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:12,430
forced to give right and you didn't feel

1561
00:52:11,049 --> 00:52:13,809
free to go down while I was saying this

1562
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:15,519
and read this first at the bottom of the

1563
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:16,989
page when you're forced to give there's

1564
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:18,999
no heart involved in it and when there's

1565
00:52:16,989 --> 00:52:21,220
no heart there's no change okay

1566
00:52:18,999 --> 00:52:24,069
capitalism true capitalism gives us the

1567
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:26,319
opportunity to choose to give to choose

1568
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:28,690
to choose others over ourselves and that

1569
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,460
ability to choose is a change of the

1570
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,440
heart and the heart is the only way that

1571
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,569
we're going to fix this problem and many

1572
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,910
other problems that are very relevant in

1573
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:38,558
our culture in our country right now but

1574
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:40,569
and as I've said current capitalistic

1575
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,099
tendencies rooted in itself are not what

1576
00:52:40,569 --> 00:52:44,799
the Founding Fathers intended and I hope

1577
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:46,329
I help people see that today there are

1578
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:47,739
absolutely companies doing it right I

1579
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,119
know I pointed out some things that

1580
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:51,130
could potentially be wrong but there are

1581
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,989
absolutely people doing a right doing

1582
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:54,940
and doing it right but in the cases that

1583
00:52:52,989 --> 00:52:56,650
those are wrong we all have a part to

1584
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,029
play we all have a part to play as a

1585
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:59,319
part of the solution and I hope I've

1586
00:52:58,029 --> 00:53:01,480
been able to present those to you as

1587
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:03,040
well ultimately we have a choice between

1588
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,290
the good of humanity

1589
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,550
for the good assault and at a time when

1590
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:08,020
I believe it's never been more relevant

1591
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:11,440
I'm imploring everybody that's listening

1592
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:13,750
to this talk please choose humanity I

1593
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,100
choose others choose the industry I

1594
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:17,100
choose the thing that you love
