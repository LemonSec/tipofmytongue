1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,600
so

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,880
hey everyone my name is jason and uh

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,480
basically what i'm gonna go over today

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,120
is what we're seeing from an intrusion

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,880
perspective

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,479
as well as best practices on how we can

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,920
combat these different intrusions

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,359
we'll talk about high level trends and a

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,960
variety of different things we'll also

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,920
dive deep into a few use cases

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,279
so uh shouldn't be fairly entertaining

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,480
let's uh i guess let's see where this

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,320
goes

14
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,920
so here's me i'm the director of the

15
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,519
strategic thread advisory group

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,960
and basically what we do is we help our

17
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,320
customers operationalize their threat

18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
intelligence as well as their threat

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
hunting capabilities

20
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,600
prior to crowdstrike i used to be a uh i

21
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,040
used to be in a big4 consulting firm

22
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,480
where i built thread intel programs for

23
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,200
fortune 500 companies and government

24
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,718
agencies

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,160
and prior to that i was in the u.s army

26
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,360
for about seven years where i did stuff

27
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,679
at a nsa in cyber command

28
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,879
so here is a here's kind of a review of

29
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,239
what we'll be going over we're gonna

30
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,280
talk at a high level about the purpose

31
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,718
of threat hunting

32
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,920
uh we'll go into an intrusion threat

33
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,280
landscape so we can have some of the

34
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
strategic perspective

35
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,320
we'll do a few tactical observations all

36
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
i'm actually going to pick some use

37
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,559
cases that i think are going to be

38
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,920
relevant to you guys

39
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,399
and then we'll talk about how to engage

40
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,600
in practice for hunting operations

41
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,360
so on that note let's go ahead and get

42
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,039
started um so we'll start with the

43
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,280
purpose of threat hunting and uh for me

44
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,720
personally it's quite simple actually

45
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,119
uh what it comes down to for me is this

46
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,119
number right here so we actually took a

47
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,040
tabulation of all the av solutions

48
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,640
combined and on average and this

49
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,280
includes crowdstrike by the way so on

50
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,640
on average they all stop about 98.3

51
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,479
percent of attacks

52
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,600
so what that implies is about 1.7

53
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,079
percent of things are going to get

54
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
through

55
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,720
so that of course begs the question so

56
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,159
what what happens with that 1.7

57
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,360
so when you think about it like when you

58
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,000
think about how endpoint security has

59
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,600
evolved

60
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,680
you know back in the day you pretty much

61
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,119
only have av right and then you know

62
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,799
organizations were consistently getting

63
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,399
breached and we realized okay that's not

64
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,960
enough right in addition to having

65
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,640
av we also need to have visibility which

66
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,759
is sort of where your edr comes from

67
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,200
you know it gives you visibility

68
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,640
throughout your environment now you have

69
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,439
the capacity to kind of look at these

70
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,759
trends

71
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,279
find a few more anomalies um the

72
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,399
challenge of this of course though is

73
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,119
that there will still be things that

74
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,719
will defeat

75
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,280
even edr as well because again both edr

76
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,798
and aav

77
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,720
these are automated detection systems

78
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,399
right and for a smart adversary

79
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,920
they sort of get it they understand how

80
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,520
these detection systems work

81
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,799
and ultimately that's that's the purpose

82
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,400
of threat hunting you know because like

83
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,560
we it's it's the acknowledgment

84
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,760
that we're not going to stop everything

85
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,520
from an automated perspective

86
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,040
no matter how much we want to no matter

87
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,480
how hard we try

88
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,480
there will always be those anomalies

89
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,319
they get through and you know

90
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,599
some examples of those anomalies you

91
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,160
know let's let's take some let's take

92
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,000
some uh

93
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,840
you know just some basic ones right like

94
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,239
a good a good spearfish something that

95
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,920
actually

96
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,360
it was is able to deliver either a

97
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,518
malicious executable

98
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,120
or route someone to a malicious url to

99
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,680
where they interface with the url

100
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
perhaps

101
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,680
uh leak their own credentials there's a

102
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
lot of things that no matter how hard we

103
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,519
try

104
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,280
sometimes they're just gonna get through

105
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,959
that would be an example of one of them

106
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,879
another would be lateral movement so

107
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,160
let's take a case where you have maybe a

108
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,840
trusted third party

109
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,920
or even if you have credentials leaked

110
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,760
on somewhere like paceman or whatnot

111
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,119
there are some cases where once again if

112
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,720
the actor is doing

113
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,879
everything in a legitimate manner if

114
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,879
they're using legit credentials that are

115
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,959
are you know high that are functional

116
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,959
then that is still going to work

117
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,120
and then same thing with the ability for

118
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,760
actors to kind of navigate around on the

119
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,680
machine

120
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,440
using native tools things that once

121
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,680
again aren't necessarily going

122
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,599
to set off you know an alert like let's

123
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,159
take like powershell for instance

124
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,640
or modifying legitimate binaries or

125
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,319
using

126
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,679
uh remote administration capabilities

127
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,079
such as ps exec

128
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
or rdp so like things like that right

129
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,879
like there will always be

130
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,360
things that technology just isn't going

131
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,280
to stop and even

132
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,799
beyond even beyond some of those

133
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,720
fileless technique right

134
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,080
techniques there's even advances in

135
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,599
malware that are really also kind of

136
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,519
changing this and making it to where

137
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,040
even from an av perspective there's

138
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,560
sometimes you know a pretty strong

139
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,440
probability that we're not going to stop

140
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,519
those either

141
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,879
so here's here are three examples of

142
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,080
what we're seeing from an advanced

143
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,599
malware perspective

144
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,959
in terms of how in terms of like how

145
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,000
these things are causing problems for

146
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,879
organizations

147
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,879
so the first one is around uh banking

148
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,560
trojans that are developed by botnets so

149
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,079
the back story behind this

150
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,599
is uh i was literally talking to our

151
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,040
intelligence lead one time

152
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,679
and i noticed that we literally pumped

153
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,798
out 400 indicators for trickbot within

154
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,239
about two minutes

155
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,360
and i talked and was like hey i think we

156
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,239
i think there's something wrong with the

157
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,079
indicator feed

158
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,918
they just created 400 different trick

159
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,358
bot variations and he's like nope that's

160
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,719
how much these botanists can pump out if

161
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,479
they want they can pop out literally a

162
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,440
fort like that much in that small of a

163
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,800
time span

164
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,160
so the challenge of that of course is

165
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
now you're going to be overwhelmed by

166
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,639
new signatures things that you've never

167
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,919
seen before

168
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,360
you know and then if you move over one

169
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,639
to the right now you have custom

170
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,560
compiled ransomware

171
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,919
so in this case you know like let's take

172
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,040
a lot of these major ransomware attacks

173
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,960
that happened last year

174
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,479
the organizations that got hit by those

175
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,919
they're actually being hit by ransomware

176
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,560
variants that were custom compiled just

177
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,080
for them

178
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,199
so essentially again you're being hit

179
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
with something that's totally unique

180
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,320
that the world has never seen before

181
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,240
and then you know then you have the case

182
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,360
of polymorphic malware and then with

183
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,040
polymorphic malware

184
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,479
that's a that's also able to change its

185
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,840
hash every time it's leveraged

186
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,159
so you know you're dealing with a lot of

187
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,520
different things that create again

188
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,360
challenges for av

189
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
challenges for detection so on and so

190
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,440
forth

191
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,479
and just to drive the point home you

192
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,960
know this is becoming an

193
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,320
increasingly costly problem to society

194
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,159
here are some of the largest ransom

195
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,039
demands that we were able to detect as

196
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
of last year

197
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,240
and as you can see the numbers are

198
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
consistently going up and what

199
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,840
what happens is that basically the more

200
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,320
that these attacks succeed

201
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,039
the more bold the actors feel in terms

202
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,240
of collecting

203
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,759
ransom payments um between late 2018 and

204
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,280
through the end of 2019

205
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,880
the top actor that we were tracking

206
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,198
wizard spider collected about a grand

207
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,120
total of 100 million dollars in bitcoin

208
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,840
which once again kind of speaks to the

209
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,440
you know to the severity of this problem

210
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,880
so ultimately kind of here's you know

211
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,199
here's the challenge right once again we

212
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,240
have to

213
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,680
we have plan to recognize that

214
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,479
technology alone cannot stop all

215
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,320
breaches

216
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,840
and you know obviously like ultimately

217
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,599
we want to be able to achieve two goals

218
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,719
from a threat hunting perspective

219
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,960
we want to be able to harden our

220
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,479
security posture and we have to be but

221
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,840
we have to be able to do this in a cost

222
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,919
effective manner right and

223
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,440
also in an efficient manner and then at

224
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,479
the same time in addition to hardening

225
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,479
our security posture

226
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,080
we also have to manage costs because you

227
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,800
know all of us operate within budget

228
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,159
constraints

229
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,400
we have left and right limits you know

230
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,080
we have to actually find effective ways

231
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,520
to do things that are consistent with

232
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,280
the resources that we are given

233
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,560
and there's a lot of considerations here

234
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,479
it could you know we want we want to

235
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,560
think about things like risk reduction

236
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,758
and the ability to acquire talent and

237
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,520
then retain the talent

238
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,960
so you know all of us you know our cyber

239
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,400
security professionals we're aware that

240
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,039
you know there's a big cyber security

241
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,960
shortage

242
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,159
across the industry so you know when you

243
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,758
find a talented person it could

244
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,039
sometimes be hard to retain them which

245
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,800
is yet another challenge when it comes

246
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,840
to threat hunting

247
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,080
you know there's stock security

248
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,840
efficiencies so how do we do things that

249
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,599
help reduce the time it takes for us to

250
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,638
do those things that's another objective

251
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,960
of threat hunting

252
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,319
and then complexity reduction as well if

253
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,680
we're using a million different tools

254
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,880
that have a million different knobs and

255
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,080
buttons and they all interact

256
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,680
differently with each other

257
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,359
that you know increases the time that it

258
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,039
takes for us to react to events

259
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,080
and thereby increases the complexity so

260
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,080
we want to reduce that

261
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,039
so let's go ahead and take a look at

262
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,319
some of the strategic trends that we've

263
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,080
been seeing from an intrusion threat

264
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,720
landscape perspective

265
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,000
um so overall intrusions are increasing

266
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,000
across the board

267
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,360
oops sorry went backwards and for some

268
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,199
reason this is loading the wrong way

269
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,560
there we go all right so let's take a

270
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,560
look at what we saw last year from an

271
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
overwatch perspective um

272
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,440
so overwatch is our threat hunting

273
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,919
capability and what you're looking at

274
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,560
here

275
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,719
is the amount of intrusions that we saw

276
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,280
between quarter one of 2019

277
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
and quarter one in 2020. as you can see

278
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,719
here the state-sponsored ones remain

279
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,240
relatively static and the logic behind

280
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,000
that is nation states they sort of just

281
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,280
have static operations

282
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,120
they you know they have consistent

283
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,000
objectives they don't necessarily surge

284
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,759
in size or surge in operational capacity

285
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,880
they tend to operate at a steady state

286
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,000
and the only things that really make

287
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,000
them surge are major

288
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,440
geopolitical events whereas if you look

289
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,440
at e-crime on the other hand

290
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,759
it's exact opposite we're noticing a

291
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,400
steady e-crime increase over time

292
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,319
and honestly to be kind of blunt what

293
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,318
this implies to me is that overall is an

294
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,039
industry that we're not doing the right

295
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,360
things

296
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,599
whatever we are doing it appears to not

297
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,280
be as effective as it needs to be

298
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,400
which once again really kind of speaks

299
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,080
to the problem right we have an

300
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,000
adversary that's getting stronger

301
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,599
more capable and they're continuing to

302
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,319
find ways to bypass our defensive

303
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,840
systems

304
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,199
so you know again this for me is

305
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,159
personally a big reason why threat

306
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,440
hunting matters

307
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,039
and you know one of the reasons i

308
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,800
circled this quarter over here if you

309
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,520
see this large spike within this last

310
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,960
quarter

311
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,680
uh in my opinion that is because of

312
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,400
cobin 19. and what kobe 19 has done

313
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,400
to us as a cyber security industry is

314
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,159
that it has increased our own our

315
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,319
organization's attack surface

316
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,760
so think of it like this all of us are

317
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,800
using the internet more than we ever

318
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,240
have in the past

319
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,478
we're making phone calls we're using

320
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,919
more applications we're using more tools

321
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,080
and all of those things create

322
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,680
opportunities for actors to

323
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
come come at us across our attack

324
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,279
surface so that's another you know key

325
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,040
theme here as well that we're looking at

326
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,839
this big attack surface expansion

327
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,680
which is resulting in more e-crime

328
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,440
attacks

329
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,800
so moving on intrusions are also

330
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,800
becoming more complex

331
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,319
as well so i'm going to introduce a term

332
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
to you guys and it's this term right

333
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,640
here called distinct and sophisticated

334
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,160
so there are basically two different

335
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,839
types of intrusions that we see

336
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,120
there are things that we've seen before

337
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,560
you know whether it's like powershell

338
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,080
scripts or command line scripts and

339
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,839
things that we've seen in the past

340
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,440
and we kind of know what to hunt against

341
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,640
because we've seen it used elsewhere

342
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,480
and then there are techniques that we've

343
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,800
never seen before and that's what we

344
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,440
call

345
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,439
distinct and sophisticated intrusions so

346
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,880
literally within a quarter time span

347
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,480
over the last quarter there has been a

348
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,080
50 increase in distinct and

349
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,320
sophisticated intrusions

350
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,080
the challenge of this is now that with

351
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,440
these ones no one in the world has ever

352
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,360
at least

353
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,720
i guess that let me rephrase that not no

354
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,880
one in the world but no one in

355
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,480
crowdstrike which has a global view

356
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,080
has ever seen this before so that's been

357
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,440
very problematic for us

358
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,519
we've also just we've also seen an

359
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,880
increase in the raw amount as well

360
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,080
so uh and in terms of as of as of may so

361
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,160
as of last month

362
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,760
we had observed 81 of the total of 2019

363
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,439
and like i said earlier uh you know the

364
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,600
majority of these are e-crime and the

365
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,120
actual total number here is 83

366
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
and then also as of may we stopped about

367
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,720
18k total breaches

368
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,640
so in addition to an increase in

369
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,079
distinct and sophisticated intrusions

370
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,600
like i said earlier we're also kind of

371
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,160
seeing an increase in the volume as well

372
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,760
so in terms of a breakdown like i said

373
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,000
like it says up here you know 83 of

374
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
these

375
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,200
are e-crime and again it's not that the

376
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,920
nation-states are

377
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,519
doing less they're just not increasing

378
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,959
or as your criminal actors are

379
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,720
increasing exponentially

380
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,399
um the top four industries that we've

381
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,160
seen be targeted by e-crime actors

382
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,079
are the technology industry

383
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,000
manufacturing financial

384
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,599
and healthcare and then the top five

385
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,480
that we've seen being targeted

386
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,519
by uh by the nation states are telecom

387
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,480
manufacturing

388
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,240
healthcare media and government and that

389
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,399
of course is the cobit 19 factor

390
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,440
uh we we took a measure actually between

391
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,040
february and march

392
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,120
just to see what was the difference in

393
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,199
cobin 19 themed files

394
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,959
and literally you have it's it's went

395
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,360
from about 10 in february

396
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,880
to a well over a thousand within march

397
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,399
so again we're noticing this for this

398
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,240
tendency for actors to really take

399
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,760
advantage of global trends

400
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,480
as part of their uh as part of their

401
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,480
attack patterns

402
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,320
so the other the other thing that we're

403
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,160
noticing is that attacks are relying

404
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,360
more and more on fileless techniques

405
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,560
and just to illustrate this i'm going to

406
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,519
show you the difference between what we

407
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,479
saw in 2018 relative to 2019

408
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,480
so in 2018 we saw about 60 malware

409
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,040
attacks and about 40 percent non-malware

410
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,279
attacks

411
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,640
and again non-malwares things like using

412
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,000
legitimate credentials

413
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,839
power shell rdp ps exec

414
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,399
modifying legitimate binaries those kind

415
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,399
of things and what we noticed was that

416
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,160
the further up the maturity of the actor

417
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,600
the better their ability to engage in

418
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,360
these non-malware attacks

419
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,880
so for instance organized criminal gangs

420
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,079
in nation states that

421
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,839
demonstrated a pretty a pretty

422
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,439
significant capability to leverage those

423
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,440
as part of their intrusion campaigns

424
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,719
so in 2019 we actually saw for the first

425
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,800
time

426
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,959
the non-malware attacks be the overall

427
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,800
more prevalent than the malware attacks

428
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,239
so again this is yet another reason why

429
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,240
hunting is critical right

430
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,000
the more time the more the adversary is

431
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,600
able to evolve towards things that do

432
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,240
not rely on signatures

433
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,079
the less effective av will become and it

434
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,800
does not matter how advanced the av

435
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,079
is av is designed to detect signatures

436
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,279
and even in the case of let's say

437
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,959
something like crowdstrike right like

438
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,399
crowdstrike does a lot of behavioral

439
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,160
analysis as well

440
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
again those things are based off

441
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,360
precedent so

442
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,600
ultimately unless we have a precedent we

443
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,040
cannot create the detections for it

444
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,480
so when you take the fact that

445
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
adversaries are using non-malware

446
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,959
attacks

447
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,480
and as well as with the fact that we're

448
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,040
seeing an increase in sophisticated and

449
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,880
distinct

450
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,480
intrusions that really creates a

451
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,040
challenge for you know defenders in

452
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
general

453
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,360
because now we're faced with a lot of

454
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,360
things that we haven't seen before

455
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,040
so here's what we're seeing by region uh

456
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,800
basically

457
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,319
what you'll observe is that the more

458
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,160
mature the region

459
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,440
the more likely the adversary is to use

460
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,600
malware free attacks

461
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,040
so obviously you see north america with

462
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,240
now instead of you know 50

463
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,160
not now or free attacks closer to 75

464
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,079
so again this is very problematic right

465
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,880
because the more malware free attacks

466
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,040
that they use

467
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,959
the less likely av is going to work

468
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,800
whereas if you compare north america

469
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,199
to latin america now you see that the

470
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,199
adversary favors almost exclusively

471
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,639
malware-based attacks and the logic

472
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,920
behind this is very simple

473
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,240
what it really comes down to is the

474
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,199
maturity of the market so think of it

475
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,920
like this

476
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,120
you know actors are opportunist and

477
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,279
they're business people

478
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,639
they want to they want to save time so

479
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,279
like for instance in the case of latin

480
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,120
america

481
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,959
if they can execute these attacks you

482
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,079
know using commodity malware and they

483
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,680
can automate the process

484
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,439
that's exactly what they're going to do

485
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,719
whereas in north america they really

486
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,920
they don't have that same luxury because

487
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,680
there's a stronger cyber security

488
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,199
posture in north america

489
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,199
so again you'll notice that actors tend

490
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,880
to pivot their techniques

491
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,839
based off whatever the path of least

492
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,839
resistance is

493
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,518
so moving on let's take a look at

494
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,240
malware as well because again it's not

495
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,079
necessarily

496
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
just malware free attacks but we're also

497
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,479
seeing consistent malware attacks as

498
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,638
well

499
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,760
so in general from an intrusion

500
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,120
perspective

501
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,720
here is that here's the prevalence of

502
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,720
malware we're seeing and i want to

503
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,079
emphasize that these are non-targeted

504
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,680
malware families and what that means is

505
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,319
these are the criminal ones that we're

506
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,560
seeing

507
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,920
so the most common one is andromeda

508
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,680
slash gamma ru

509
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,199
gamma rho i don't know exactly how to

510
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,519
pronounce that but basically

511
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,959
think of it as a modular trojan that is

512
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,760
passed around by russian criminal

513
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,680
communities

514
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,680
it is it is a common trojan that they

515
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,959
will leverage in order to gain access

516
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,880
and then in many cases once the

517
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,160
adversary gains access then they'll

518
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,760
actually sell that access to someone

519
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,199
else who might be more well suited to

520
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,800
exploit the actual uh

521
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,040
the actual uh access into the

522
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,760
environment second most common was coin

523
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,519
miners

524
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,439
which very simple just using computing

525
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,160
resources to mine bitcoin

526
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,600
uh third most common was emote so in

527
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,399
this case again a very popular

528
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,880
downloader

529
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,560
we have js bond app which is basically a

530
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,600
data collector that uh collects

531
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,479
information from

532
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,079
removable drives uh quackbot is another

533
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,040
popular banking trojan

534
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,760
and then you have go goes the isfv which

535
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,760
is uh

536
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,760
essentially another banking trojan

537
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,600
variant so again this is kind of the

538
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,319
prevalence of what we are seeing from a

539
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,440
malware perspective

540
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,800
so let's go into a few case studies um

541
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,720
i'm going to open up some ones that i

542
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,240
think are relevant for you guys

543
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,839
and the first one that we're going to

544
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,120
talk about is something that we saw

545
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,600
wizard spider do

546
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,920
so wizard spider for everybody's context

547
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,160
is the user of the ryuk ransomware

548
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,319
so if you guys remember last year uh

549
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,560
ryuk was by far the most effective

550
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,959
ransomware used in human history

551
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,199
uh in general it disproportionately

552
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,518
affected four types of industries

553
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,839
that was municipal and state government

554
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,920
healthcare

555
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,120
manufacturing and the education sector

556
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,279
so what you're looking at here is

557
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,680
actually a recent attack that we saw

558
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,560
uh leveraged by wizard spider where

559
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,880
instead of using

560
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,560
their normal trickbot banking trojan to

561
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,480
engage in the reconnaissance process and

562
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,319
the navigation process they were

563
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,480
they actually uh because they saw that

564
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,000
it was crowdstrike they actually used

565
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,519
different processes so i'm gonna i'm

566
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,959
gonna explain how that works

567
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,560
so typically the the first thing that

568
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,839
wizard spider will do when they gain

569
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,279
access to your environment

570
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,759
is they will seek to understand your

571
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,880
security software so in this case wizard

572
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,000
spider

573
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,759
sought to understand the security

574
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,680
software and they saw that crowdstrike

575
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,519
falcon prevent was on the machine

576
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,920
so what they did was they changed up

577
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,160
their tactics instead of using malware

578
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,319
to execute the attack they used things

579
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,040
that that did not rely on malware

580
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,560
like process injections and powershell

581
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,920
and leveraging windows management

582
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,359
instrumentation which is a network

583
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,279
management capability

584
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,680
so here is the powershell here's the

585
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,199
powershell capability that they executed

586
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,319
where they're basically looking for

587
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,439
different types of certificates and

588
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,160
they're looking for information on the

589
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,079
system

590
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,600
and then here's the with the windows

591
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,319
management instrumentation process they

592
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,000
executed

593
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,160
where they're modifying svchost.exe

594
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,920
in order to again uh basically steal

595
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,399
credentials that which allows them

596
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,920
to move laterally and then ideally in

597
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
their case what was it spiders seeking

598
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,599
to do is find the domain controller

599
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,040
we were able to detect these two

600
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,519
techniques because we had seen them

601
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,360
before

602
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,640
leveraged by wizard spider and at this

603
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,280
point once they executed these

604
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
techniques

605
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,639
we were able to kick the adversary out

606
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,880
of the environment

607
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,559
the next tactical case i have for you is

608
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,360
pinchy is an adversary called pinchy

609
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,520
spider

610
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,280
so pinchy spider actually let me back up

611
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,760
all adversaries at crowdstrike have two

612
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,240
names

613
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,599
a first name and a last name the last

614
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,520
name is the type of actor

615
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,839
and the first name is the specialty so

616
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,599
for instance spider actors are criminals

617
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,840
whereas pinchy spider means they

618
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,840
specialize in two types of ransomware

619
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,439
they have the gan crab ransomware and

620
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,360
then they have a more recent variant

621
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,080
called the re-evil ransomware as a

622
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,600
service

623
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,840
so in this case what we're actually

624
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
looking at is a hospitality entity

625
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,199
that was targeted by the re-evil

626
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,600
ransomware as a service

627
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,039
so this has been problematic for a lot

628
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,678
of organizations

629
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,160
basically with ransomware as a service

630
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,600
here's what's kind of going on here

631
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,960
let's go back to last year to kind of

632
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,719
compare and contrast ransomware to

633
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,880
ransomware as a service

634
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,000
so last year on the large part was

635
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,160
dominated by somewhere

636
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,360
between five to seven really big

637
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,720
ransomware operators

638
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,320
and when you think about the majority of

639
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,520
the money that was actually stolen last

640
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,439
year in terms of bitcoin

641
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,879
that was done by these really big

642
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,200
ransomware operators you know groups

643
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,679
like

644
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,799
wizard spider and you know indrik spider

645
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,559
and the ones that were leveraging some

646
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,559
of the major ransomware types

647
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,720
this year what we are seeing is a large

648
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,320
preponderance of ransomware as a service

649
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,080
ransomware as a service is basically

650
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,799
when the ransomware operator

651
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,439
has affiliates so each each of these

652
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,360
operators

653
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,960
now have up to about 25 different

654
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,559
affiliates so ins

655
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,240
here's what's going on this year so

656
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,360
instead of having five to seven major

657
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,360
ransomware operators

658
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,639
now you have five to seven ransomware

659
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,439
operators who each have

660
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,039
25 affiliates working under them so i

661
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,360
mean just some let's do some simple math

662
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,879
here

663
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,559
five times 25 is about 125.

664
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,240
so that's one of the challenges that

665
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,000
we're dealing with as an industry right

666
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,679
now the velocity of attacks occurring

667
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,160
against us is happening at a much higher

668
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,679
rate

669
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,360
because these ransomware operators are

670
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,320
now taking on affiliates

671
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,320
to engage in part of their in in attacks

672
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,080
so here's what this actor did

673
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,159
this was a this was an attack that i

674
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,559
think was enabled by copenhagen

675
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,240
so let's think about what coven 19 did

676
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,160
you know immediately all like

677
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,360
we start we go into quarantine right we

678
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,559
all have to work from home

679
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
and with think about what a lot of

680
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,039
businesses went through when they tried

681
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,760
to transition to a work from home

682
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,600
posture

683
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,760
they're trying to set up vpns they're

684
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,639
trying to set up you know a good rdp

685
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,640
capability

686
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,960
and in this case what happened was

687
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,760
pinchy spider was able to engage in rdp

688
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,160
scanning

689
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,120
and they found an rdp connection with a

690
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,679
very poor

691
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,360
uh a very poor password configuration so

692
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,400
they were able to engage in a password

693
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,559
spraying attack

694
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,919
and they'd use that to actually get in

695
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,760
so once they got in

696
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,960
what they tried to do was they tried to

697
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,879
stop different uh

698
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,400
processes that were running on the

699
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,400
machine the reason

700
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,320
these actors will try to stop processes

701
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,760
before executing the ransomware

702
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,039
is because they don't want to they don't

703
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,160
want you to be able to engage in

704
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,160
incident response

705
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,520
a common incident response practice is

706
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,400
like let's say your organization's hit

707
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,080
by ransomware

708
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,320
an incident response team will often try

709
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,639
to come back in through a hung process

710
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,559
to see if they can remediate without

711
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,120
getting the uh decryption keys from the

712
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,120
actor

713
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,559
so you'll notice that when actors go in

714
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,080
they will often try to stop

715
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,678
these uh they're gonna try to stop

716
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,720
attacks or i'm sorry stop these

717
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,799
processes

718
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,919
so ultimately we were able to detect

719
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,918
this actor in action

720
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,679
we saw them trying to stop the processes

721
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,120
and we also saw them use it as a

722
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,559
particular binary

723
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,158
by modifying svhost.exe so this was

724
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,960
another case where we were able to stop

725
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,880
this attack

726
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,480
simply by having threat hunting you know

727
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,760
so again it kind of really illustrates

728
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,559
the importance

729
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,080
and then the last uh the last tactical

730
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,879
use case i'll talk about

731
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,678
is actually a nation-state adversary so

732
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,200
for uh

733
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,360
for pandas what that means what that

734
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,039
means is china and what you're looking

735
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,959
at is the use of a

736
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,400
an implant called the cobalt strike

737
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,120
implant so

738
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,520
what china does is they don't have like

739
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,199
so

740
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,200
i guess actually let me back up so

741
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,120
cobalt strike implant

742
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,400
the way i would think of this is kind of

743
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,239
like metasploit

744
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,000
it is a single malware framework that

745
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,799
has a lot of capabilities embedded

746
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,799
within it

747
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,840
so once they are in though they're able

748
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,440
to not if they're

749
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,280
able to use techniques that are organic

750
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,200
to the machine to navigate around

751
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,960
things such as process halloween process

752
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,240
injection the ability to steal web

753
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,679
sessions cookies

754
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,840
and then we saw them leverage several

755
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,200
command line techniques in order to

756
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,439
achieve their objectives

757
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,280
uh with with this unidentified panda

758
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,400
actor what they were seeking to do was

759
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,000
steal credentials

760
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,760
and then navigate around and then

761
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
ultimately achieve access to a target

762
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
where

763
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,600
they were which would enable them to

764
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,760
engage in industrial espionage

765
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,840
um this one was easier to detect than

766
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,480
most uh and the reason for that is the

767
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
first

768
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,360
the first step that they leveraged was

769
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,360
the cobalt strike implant and we had

770
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,039
active indicators and yara hunts to be

771
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,799
able to detect against that one

772
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,000
so that was helpful and then also some

773
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,840
of the stuff that they did was very

774
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,960
noisy and where we were able to detect

775
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,720
it relatively quickly

776
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,640
but once again though it was this is

777
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,480
what this is another use case where

778
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,919
without the threat hunting capability it

779
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,840
may not we may not have actually been

780
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,520
successful

781
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,959
so those are our tactical uh those are

782
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,240
our tactical examples and now we're

783
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,679
going to talk about how to engage in

784
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:11,440
proactive threat hunting operations

785
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,919
so in my experience with threat hunting

786
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,280
it sort of comes down to three big

787
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,799
things like when you think about your

788
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,399
own threat hunting operation

789
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,240
there are really three big factors that

790
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,559
you want to consider

791
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,559
the first is data invisibility so you

792
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,000
have to have something to hunt against

793
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,678
you can have the most talented people in

794
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,799
the world and the most talented people

795
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,159
could have all the coolest and best

796
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,440
tools in the world

797
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,120
but if you don't actually have a data

798
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,000
source and you don't have visibility on

799
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
that data source

800
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,360
that you're not going to be able to hunt

801
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,239
against so hunt against it so that's one

802
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,600
factor right

803
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,760
and then of course the other factor is

804
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,600
the human expertise so you know

805
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,799
i keep on going back this and you can't

806
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,840
automate everything

807
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,200
so if there is something that you're

808
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,840
looking at like an automated threat

809
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,360
hunting service uh i would question that

810
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,720
because ultimately again the whole

811
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,199
purpose of threat hunting is to be able

812
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,600
to use

813
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,240
human ingenuity in order to find and

814
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,840
detect

815
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,440
the other humans that are on the other

816
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,840
side who are attacking us

817
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,120
and lastly these humans and the data

818
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,720
that they have access to

819
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,199
need to now be able to use tools and

820
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,559
techniques in order to exploit this data

821
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,600
and i'll talk about so i'll talk about

822
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,200
some of these tools and techniques and

823
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,719
some of the common ones we see as well

824
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,400
uh as we uh continue through the brief

825
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,520
so first i'll i'm gonna give you i'm

826
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
gonna show you how kind of we do to

827
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,158
crowdstrike

828
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,600
so crowdstrike we use something called

829
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,080
threat graph which is represented by

830
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,158
this cloud

831
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,360
here and then i don't i mean you guys

832
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,559
may or may not be aware of this

833
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,399
but basically the way that we do

834
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,158
endpoint security is we put a single

835
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,880
lightweight agent on the machine

836
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,640
and instead of engaging in av and edr

837
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,720
operations on the machine itself

838
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,400
we send the data to the cloud and then

839
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,240
we send that we send that data to a

840
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,240
database called threat graph

841
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,000
within threat graph that's how we enable

842
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,919
our own data and visibility

843
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,240
so we have access we have access to you

844
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,600
know 30 to somewhere between 30 to 35

845
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,679
million different endpoints

846
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,918
across 180 plus countries we're looking

847
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,080
at about 3.5 trillion events per week

848
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,600
and everything we look at is unencrypted

849
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,799
so that's one major advantage for

850
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,000
crowdstrike is that we're able to look

851
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,480
at this large swath

852
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,760
of unencrypted data on the endpoint and

853
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,000
something i want to emphasize

854
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,520
is the value of data on the endpoint

855
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
relative to data on

856
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,840
at the network level and basically the

857
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,159
logic of it is quite simple

858
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,158
network network level data will have

859
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,880
more however it tends to be less

860
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,720
valuable

861
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,880
and it's less valuable in my opinion for

862
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,720
two reasons reason number one is that

863
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,000
about 60 to 70 percent of network of

864
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,840
traffic is encrypted

865
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,080
and if something is encrypted what that

866
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,320
means is you do not have visibility

867
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,000
and then reason number two is around the

868
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,279
notion of attack telemetry

869
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
so think about it from the threat actual

870
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,080
perspective threat actors at the end of

871
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,918
the day

872
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,918
want to attack your endpoints they want

873
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,440
to attack your laptops and your servers

874
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,080
and your workloads and your mobile

875
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,120
devices they go through networks to get

876
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,799
to your endpoints

877
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,399
so for those two reasons i do consider

878
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,760
the endpoint to be a superior data

879
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,320
source when it comes to actually having

880
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,760
a visibility

881
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,678
the next area over is around human

882
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,960
expertise so again it doesn't have to be

883
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,240
like it doesn't necessarily have to be

884
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,440
this way right but here's what

885
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,919
crowdstrike

886
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,200
seeks to do we want to if for us and the

887
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,880
way that we engage in

888
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,039
hunting operations we want to have a

889
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,120
broad swath of different people

890
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,480
who have different types of expertise so

891
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,918
we have a lot of people who have

892
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,600
come from commercial backgrounds who

893
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,120
work from other vendors we have people

894
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,000
like myself who come from military

895
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,080
backgrounds

896
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,840
law enforcement backgrounds as well as

897
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,879
expertise in different systems

898
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,320
such as linux or mac or windows you know

899
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,919
or different disciplines like

900
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,439
understanding network forensics

901
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,200
or being coming maybe coming from an

902
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,760
application vulnerability background

903
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,760
so again one one advantage or one thing

904
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,600
that you would want to seek to really

905
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,039
do in your own threat hunting program is

906
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,760
to have people from a broad set of

907
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,440
backgrounds

908
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,879
because you're going to face a broad set

909
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,559
of threats and then the other

910
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,919
consideration in addition to the

911
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,840
people's backgrounds

912
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,120
is also the time in which you want to

913
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,520
hunt so you know

914
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,799
we do 24 7 because we're able to scale

915
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,320
as a business and do that

916
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,080
however you know that that may not be

917
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,760
possible for all organizations

918
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,360
maybe some organizations can only hunt

919
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,200
from nine to five and you know that

920
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,639
that's okay right you you do what you

921
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,240
can and it's all about you know doing

922
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,159
what's most efficient for you

923
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,840
in the most cost effective manner there

924
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,200
is no necessary there isn't necessarily

925
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,678
a right or wrong answer

926
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,679
i mean obviously 24 7 is better than you

927
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,279
know nine to five five days a week

928
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,720
but at the same time again we all

929
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,240
operate within resource constraints

930
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,240
so that of course is a major factor

931
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,840
and then lastly let's talk about some of

932
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,439
the tools and techniques that we see

933
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,039
so i'm going to show you two that we

934
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,320
leverage and those are called hypothesis

935
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,120
testing and intelligence driven

936
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,240
analytics

937
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,239
so i'm actually just going to load up

938
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,240
this slide and i'll talk about each side

939
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,360
so this first one up here is leveraging

940
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,520
thread intelligence

941
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,199
to engage in hunting and leveraging

942
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,320
threat and leveraging good intelligence

943
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,080
basically with this

944
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,520
what you are doing is you are leveraging

945
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,320
intelligence that you've received from

946
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,480
reporting

947
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,158
or indicators and things like that in

948
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,039
order to engage in your hunting on your

949
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,640
in your hunts

950
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,080
and the logic behind this one is pretty

951
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,600
simple let's say you

952
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,199
let's say you get a threat intelligence

953
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,399
report about an attack that happened to

954
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,799
one of your peers

955
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,720
if that peer looks like you if that peer

956
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,400
has the same technologies you do if

957
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,760
they're at a similar line of business

958
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,520
then it's very likely that the same

959
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,158
adversary that attacked that peer

960
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,200
will also attack you so that is one area

961
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,400
where crowdstrike

962
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,760
engages in threat hunting that's one

963
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,440
tool that we use is which is

964
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,760
intelligence driven analytics

965
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,600
and the other is hypothesis testing so

966
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,559
hypothesis testing can be derived from a

967
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,240
lot of things

968
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,840
so for example crowdstrike does this in

969
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,440
a variety of ways

970
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,959
one way that we do it is that we

971
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,760
leverage our understanding of other

972
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,679
industries

973
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,440
to hunt in the industry that you're in

974
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,120
so let's say for example that you are a

975
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,799
retail organization

976
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,719
and crowdstrike is protecting you as a

977
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,080
retail organization in addition to

978
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,080
hunting in your environment

979
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,240
we're also hunting in hundreds of other

980
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,000
retail organization environments

981
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,600
and we can take the data that we've seen

982
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,360
there and we can take the trends and

983
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,959
then statistics that we've seen there

984
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,799
and applied that against your

985
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,919
organization so that would be

986
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,039
that would be the discipline of

987
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,760
hypothesis testing and uh

988
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,120
sorry these aren't the only two but

989
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,600
these are two of the more common ones

990
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,678
that we

991
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,439
we leverage so again kind of going back

992
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,120
to like what is what is threat hunting

993
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,440
it is a combination of these three

994
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,158
things and you do want to consider each

995
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,039
element

996
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,640
you know whether you're going to build

997
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,440
it out yourself or whether you're going

998
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,080
to go with a

999
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,039
with a partner provider so in terms of

1000
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,399
next steps

1001
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,000
uh here's kind of like you know coming

1002
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,760
back to the beginning right and again

1003
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,080
let's replace this why crowdstrike with

1004
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,039
why

1005
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,720
threat hunting because it doesn't

1006
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,080
necessarily have to be crowdstrike you

1007
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,760
know ultimately our goal

1008
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,120
is to harden your you know the goal is

1009
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,120
to harden your security posture

1010
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,399
and also manage cost so i know from a

1011
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,840
crowdstrike perspective

1012
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,000
um you know last year we were able to

1013
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,080
stop about 35 000 potential breaches

1014
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,440
and we're well on our way to doing uh at

1015
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,279
least like

1016
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,559
about 1.5 uh times this number this year

1017
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,840
and then lastly you want to you want to

1018
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,320
be able to manage your cost as well

1019
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,080
right

1020
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,840
so i know for crowdstrike when we do it

1021
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,678
when we engage in complexity reduction

1022
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,279
we're able to save customers about 50k

1023
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,120
on average in terms of save costs and

1024
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,240
tools because now you're consolidating

1025
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,918
into a single tool

1026
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,159
into a single pane of glass in a single

1027
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,960
environment uh on average we save about

1028
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,720
120k

1029
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,559
in cost of the sock because we're able

1030
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,320
to do things in a more timely manner

1031
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,399
from a talent acquisition and retention

1032
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,879
perspective uh what we are observing is

1033
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,639
that the

1034
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,000
the average threat hunter when it comes

1035
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,480
to their fully loaded cost

1036
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,039
costs about 200k so when i say fully

1037
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,720
loaded

1038
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,399
obviously i mean things like salary and

1039
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,520
bonuses and whatnot but i also mean

1040
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,439
things like pto

1041
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,918
and technology costs and healthcare and

1042
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,960
insurance and 401k matching and all that

1043
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,320
kind of stuff right

1044
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,240
on average what we're finding is that

1045
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,760
the average 300 cost about 200k

1046
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,159
total when you consider the fully loaded

1047
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,440
cost and then in terms of risk reduction

1048
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,360
you know that's another benefit of foot

1049
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,799
hunting as well and the cost of that is

1050
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,918
actually just dependent right

1051
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,120
you know if you go back if you remember

1052
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,480
back to that slide where i showed you

1053
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,479
the different ransomware demands

1054
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,919
it could depend very heavily you know

1055
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,520
the cost could be very high

1056
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,200
or it could be somewhere kind of in the

1057
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,639
you know the medium to lower range

1058
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,600
but you know you know ultimately kind of

1059
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,600
depends on the risk to your organization

1060
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,559
so that's all i have for today um you

1061
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,520
know if you guys are interested in

1062
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,480
anything that i've talked about if

1063
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,760
you're ever interested in you know

1064
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,039
having a conversation about our throat

1065
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,640
hunting capabilities and how they can

1066
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,200
support you obviously you could reach

1067
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,520
out to us

1068
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,799
as us but again this is not the point of

1069
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,320
today's conversation the point of

1070
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,279
today's conversation was to be more so

1071
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,559
educational

1072
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,399
and informative about what we've seen

1073
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,720
from an intrusion perspective

1074
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,000
so uh on that note all are there any

1075
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,520
questions is there anything that could

1076
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,520
provide further clarity on for you guys

1077
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,320
thanks jason and i don't know if you uh

1078
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,320
can see the discord but i can read uh

1079
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,158
questions to you so one of the questions

1080
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,918
comes from steve uh can you speak more

1081
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,880
about the fact that endpoint data is

1082
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,559
moving

1083
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,840
to your cloud unencrypted

1084
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:40,639
yes so think of it like this

1085
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,439
um actually i'm gonna find it i'm gonna

1086
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:51,840
get another slide that does this better

1087
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:51,840
one second

1088
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,159
so think of it like this we want to be

1089
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,799
able to understand

1090
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,480
exactly what actors are doing for us to

1091
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,320
understand what actors are doing

1092
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,679
we want to be able to collect a variety

1093
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,158
of different events

1094
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,360
so for crowdstrike personally we collect

1095
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,919
300 plus events

1096
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,559
on the endpoint so by event i mean

1097
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,840
things

1098
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:23,200
like powershell or moving laterally

1099
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,600
trying to log in changing a binary

1100
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,120
it could be executing a process it could

1101
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,559
be whatever right so that's the first

1102
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,518
portion is how many events are you

1103
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,200
collecting

1104
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,880
so traditionally this has been something

1105
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,559
that's been very hard for av

1106
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,760
let's take something like mcafee now you

1107
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,360
know again i'm not trying to knock on

1108
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,399
mcafee but i'm explaining why the

1109
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,000
difference like what the

1110
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,600
difference is between the cloud and then

1111
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,559
trying to do it all on your endpoint

1112
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,519
so mcafee does all av on the endpoint

1113
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,000
because it does everything on the

1114
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,760
endpoint

1115
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,279
it cannot collect as many events it

1116
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,720
collects about 12 events

1117
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,480
and it tries to do all that endpoint

1118
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,080
security on your machine

1119
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,600
and the challenge of that is that the

1120
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,360
more it tries to do on your machine

1121
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,799
the more the more burdensome it becomes

1122
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,479
from a data perspective

1123
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,480
so the reason crowdstriking collects so

1124
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,919
many events is because instead of trying

1125
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,679
to do everything on your machine

1126
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,159
we take that data we send it to the

1127
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,840
cloud do all the heavy analysis there

1128
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,960
and then what our customers do is even

1129
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,678
when they interface with their with

1130
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,799
their endpoints

1131
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,880
they're actually interfacing with the

1132
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,158
data in the cloud so we can process we

1133
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
have a much better processing

1134
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,039
environment

1135
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,240
here than we can on the endpoint so

1136
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,760
that's the reason that we choose to do

1137
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,480
it that way is that way we can collect

1138
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,640
more events

1139
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,880
do better data analysis engage in better

1140
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,960
protection and ultimately the goal here

1141
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,279
is to relieve the burden on the endpoint

1142
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,279
itself

1143
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,279
sure okay no i appreciate that um

1144
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,120
hopefully that answers your question

1145
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,480
steve i'm sure it does

1146
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,080
let's see another question is do you

1147
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,600
find it harder for people without a

1148
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,000
military background

1149
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,678
to break into cyber or rather do you

1150
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,600
think it makes it easier

1151
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,679
with that military or law enforcement

1152
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,080
background

1153
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:58,720
um here here is my personal observation

1154
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,000
let's imagine uh let's see if i can find

1155
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,880
a slide first i always try to find

1156
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
slides to explain things

1157
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,200
i'm fired with that yeah so

1158
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,120
i can't find a slide on the top my head

1159
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,080
but let's imagine that there are three

1160
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,399
echelons

1161
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,360
of thinking the strategic the

1162
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,000
operational

1163
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,279
and the tactical tactical would be like

1164
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,039
hands-on keyboard

1165
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,799
and the ability to code and the ability

1166
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,919
to engage in malware analysis whereas

1167
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,240
like operational

1168
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,519
would be like working in a sock right so

1169
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,039
being like a sock analyst or a

1170
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,000
vulnerability management person

1171
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,559
or ir you know a lot of what we are kind

1172
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,559
of on the

1173
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,158
in this conversation whereas strategic

1174
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,158
would be much more like higher like the

1175
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,679
political level and the geopolitical

1176
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,919
landscape and kind of the

1177
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,279
you know the strategic threats and that

1178
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,679
that kind of stuff right

1179
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,960
so what i find is that the military and

1180
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,120
law enforcement people

1181
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,159
they tend to have the better strategic

1182
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,239
understanding

1183
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,679
and maybe some operational understanding

1184
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,000
but their tactical understanding their

1185
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,080
hands

1186
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,679
on keyboard tends to be less mature than

1187
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,639
people who actually come from industry

1188
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,840
like commercial

1189
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,600
whereas a lot of my commercial

1190
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,039
counterparts are very good with the

1191
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,480
hands-on keyboard stuff they know

1192
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,320
exactly how all the tools work

1193
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,559
but then the further up they get towards

1194
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,799
the strategic that's where they tend to

1195
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,399
uh have a few more challenges so i don't

1196
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,520
think i think it's just different skill

1197
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,638
sets or i mean

1198
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,320
that's ultimately what it comes down to

1199
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,760
for me like for me personally i don't

1200
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,079
know any coding languages

1201
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,520
i mean i underst i like i understand

1202
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,119
what i'm looking at if i see command

1203
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,960
line but i personally

1204
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,960
would not be able to enter commands like

1205
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,839
a hacker i could watch them and know

1206
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,839
what they're doing

1207
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,199
but i would not be able to do it myself

1208
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,119
so i would think of it as just having

1209
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,000
like different echelons of skill sets

1210
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,919
and

1211
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,679
one is not necessarily better than the

1212
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,918
other and that's ultimately why we work

1213
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,599
in

1214
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,279
teams because you know like not

1215
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,240
everybody can be good at everything and

1216
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,040
you want to have you want you want to

1217
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,839
ultimately have people have different

1218
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,879
skill sets

1219
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,480
so i guess that's a long way to be

1220
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,239
saying that no i i do not think a

1221
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,520
military or a law enforcement background

1222
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,719
is at all required

1223
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,320
um i think the law enforcement

1224
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,439
background helps because of thinking

1225
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,800
like a bad guy

1226
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,240
same thing with a military background

1227
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,760
like it helps to think like a bad guy

1228
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,479
and i think maybe that is a benefit of

1229
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,079
threat hunting

1230
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,119
but at the same time we also tend to be

1231
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,400
less technical than a lot of our

1232
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,520
commercial counterparts

1233
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,599
so you know there's a little bit give

1234
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,119
and take ultimately

1235
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,599
sure no that makes sense and i think

1236
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,280
that's what i've i've seen so i

1237
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,480
100 agree with that i i spent a year and

1238
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,359
a half with the seals

1239
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,079
back in the day and uh definitely you

1240
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,920
can see where

1241
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,119
you know that strategic approach is is

1242
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,520
very strong

1243
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,880
uh where maybe on you know kind of the

1244
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,440
other end of the spectrum on

1245
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,040
on the technical side you're not so much

1246
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,240
and operationally yeah somewhere

1247
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,000
kind of a balance in between so

1248
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,000
yeah absolutely appreciate that yeah

1249
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,119
definitely let's see another question

1250
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
does crowdstrike have

1251
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,560
in-house threat hunting teams to hunt

1252
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,960
for

1253
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,119
or from external sources like the dark

1254
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,800
web

1255
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,359
so think of it as there are many

1256
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,960
different operations within crowdstrike

1257
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,839
so for instance from an intelligence

1258
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,680
perspective

1259
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,880
we actually collect from a variety of

1260
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,960
different sources

1261
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,720
so on our intelligence helps inform our

1262
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,240
threat hunting so i've talked a lot

1263
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,598
about endpoint telemetry so obviously

1264
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,799
yes crowdstrike is amazing at the

1265
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,480
endpoint telemetry piece

1266
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,640
but that's not the only area that we get

1267
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,000
data from we actually also get data from

1268
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,279
these five other sources

1269
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,880
so we get data from our incident

1270
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,800
response practice so like when we go and

1271
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,320
remediate when we when we find artifacts

1272
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,400
and find out about new attacks

1273
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,079
we get data there we get data from our

1274
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,720
malware and forensic analysis team

1275
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,240
who's analyzing about 800 000 uh unique

1276
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,439
malware samples per day

1277
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,959
obviously they're not analyzing all

1278
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,079
those manually but a good chunk of them

1279
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,680
they actually are especially

1280
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,440
particularly when we find new malware

1281
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,720
we take that malware apart we triage it

1282
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,119
in a separate environment

1283
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,399
uh we do hunt in the dark web and we

1284
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,800
call it underground communities because

1285
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,920
like

1286
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,839
honestly something that we're seeing

1287
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,000
these days is that the adversaries are

1288
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,279
actually using the dark web less and

1289
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,760
they're tending to favor

1290
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,320
things like whatsapp telegram and signal

1291
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,520
more

1292
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,599
and the reason they're going more

1293
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,839
towards these encrypted chat channels is

1294
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,280
the largest law enforcement and you know

1295
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,440
all the intelligence agencies

1296
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,359
they're everywhere in the dark web and

1297
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,880
you know after the shutdown of alpha bay

1298
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,680
and hansa market and some of those other

1299
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,280
bigger ones

1300
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,799
a lot of the criminals actually realize

1301
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,480
like okay we need to stop

1302
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,680
being in these open environments and we

1303
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,800
need to go to more to things like

1304
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,240
encrypted chat channels

1305
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,920
so that that's actually what we're

1306
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,680
noticing the majority of bad actor

1307
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,640
activity is now occurring in encrypted

1308
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,839
chat channels

1309
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,359
um and then there's also network

1310
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,078
telemetry so we have different network

1311
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,598
devices

1312
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,640
as well as honey pots and honey nets

1313
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,520
that we throw into adversarial

1314
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,640
infrastructure

1315
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,720
and then of course there's open source

1316
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,000
data as well so

1317
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,839
i guess that's a long way to be saying

1318
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,160
that uh we we use multiple

1319
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,440
data sources and there is no silver

1320
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,359
bullet unfortunately

1321
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,440
i mean i think the closest to a silver

1322
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,240
bullet we have is the endpoint telemetry

1323
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,359
like i think

1324
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,279
of the six of these probably a good 75

1325
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,640
to 80 percent of our valuable stuff

1326
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,400
comes from endpoint telemetry

1327
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,000
but nonetheless we still have to do the

1328
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,720
rest because otherwise you don't have a

1329
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,720
complete picture

1330
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,599
sure no that makes complete sense

1331
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,800
all right i think that looks like it for

1332
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,000
questions a lot of folks saying thank

1333
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,920
you for your service and

1334
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,079
and i can echo that definitely thank you

1335
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,440
for all you've done

1336
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,240
thank you all right jason thank you very

1337
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,160
much for coming

1338
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,359
really appreciate you sharing uh i said

1339
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,078
i was really excited for you to come

1340
