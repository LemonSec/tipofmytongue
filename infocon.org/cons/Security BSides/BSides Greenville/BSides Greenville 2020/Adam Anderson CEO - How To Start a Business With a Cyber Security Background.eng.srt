are just curious about all of the

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,249
insanity that happens inside of the

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,460
c-suite punch line it's not insanity

12
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:32,689
there's science behind it this is a rear

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:37,320
according of the b-sides talk I gave in

14
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:40,170
for besides Greenville 2020 and here we

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,050
go well I am ruggedly handsome and I do

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,870
quote my sources so that's my wife she

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,419
thinks I'm pretty and I believe her I've

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,428
been three years as the scholar and

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,620
residents for cybersecurity research at

20
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:55,559
Clemson University means I've worked

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,078
with the mba department and the the MBAs

22
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,629
to help with figuring out how

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,920
cybersecurity in business work together

24
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,539
my goal was to have people who did

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,680
business understand cybersecurity and

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,299
the people who did cybersecurity

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
understand business and that basically

28
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,369
gave me the platform I needed to write a

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,009
bunch of books to use on foreign

30
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,450
entities MBA acting entrepreneur and

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,180
residents at the College of Charleston

32
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,920
and this is for digital transformation

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,009
and cybersecurity than I'm helping those

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,170
guys out with 20 years in cyber coached

35
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,700
over a hundred business owners 17 years

36
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,439
as an entrepreneur with one

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,969
multimillion-dollar exit

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,408
yep I sold him a company we'll get into

39
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,990
it but here's my favorite bullet point

40
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,500
once upon a time I was able to talk

41
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,020
trash through the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,740
winner during a beach volleyball game on

43
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,170
Richard Branson's Island and if you guys

44
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,240
tuned in and the live beat sides I

45
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,670
actually gave more details about that

46
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,560
story it is one of my favorites in the

47
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,890
world it turns out people are just

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,890
people and people are delightful which

49
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,679
may be contrary to some of my cyber

50
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,780
friends opinion anyway all of this stuff

51
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:08,970
starts with a call to adventure meaning

52
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,890
that the the current world that you're

53
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,630
living and gets disrupted in some form

54
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,839
or fashion that makes you feel like I

55
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,890
need to change something

56
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,780
something happened at work something

57
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,089
that happened personally something has

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,239
triggered you to want to change your

59
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,849
current reality away from the employee

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,439
employer relationship and makes you

61
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,780
curious maybe I should start my own

62
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,069
business so let me kind of walk you

63
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,640
through it mine was to give you an

64
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,458
example

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,679
I was with IBM for a while and I was a

66
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:41,849
road warrior and I had over a hundred

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,819
percent travel for three years straight

68
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:46,709
one such point in time I was working

69
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:51,119
with Lockheed Martin in the US Air Force

70
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:52,680
to stand up a disaster recovery Identity

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,750
and Access Management environment in

72
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,180
Dayton Ohio so I was going back and

73
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,980
forth from Montgomery Alabama Dayton

74
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,530
Ohio Greenville South Carolina and I was

75
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:07,349
doing that for a very very long time and

76
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:10,409
one section here one one layover that I

77
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:12,238
went through was a 18 hour layover in

78
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:13,828
Montgomery Alabama and I haven't been

79
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,099
back I'm sure the airport is nice now

80
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:19,049
but when I was there about 17 years ago

81
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:22,470
it was under construction for refurbish

82
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:25,349
there was no bars there were no no Wi-Fi

83
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,799
and it was just it was horrible it was

84
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:28,018
horrible

85
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,310
and I sent about 18 hours writing on the

86
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,349
legal pack saying I'll never do this

87
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,959
again for somebody else because at this

88
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:37,198
point in time when I got home my golden

89
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,810
retriever would growl at me the gum

90
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,180
retriever even was so mad at me it peed

91
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,799
on my couch once and guys I have to tell

92
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,500
you this there's not a lot of tests that

93
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,699
are as reliable as if your golden

94
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,720
retriever doesn't like you anymore

95
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:53,730
you're doing life wrong so I talked to a

96
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,250
buddy of mine who was the director of

97
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,810
global security for large corporation

98
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,150
and he said hey why don't you leave IBM

99
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,190
start your own company and just save me

100
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,349
money but you'll also because I can pay

101
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,659
a lower rate then I pay an IBM but I can

102
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:08,340
also get you more money because you can

103
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,269
take all that money home so I thought

104
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,220
well that's great but I have a

105
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,979
non-compete with IBM I need to go talk

106
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,380
to somebody to get permission so I went

107
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,180
to my manager and I said hey I know this

108
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,680
is gonna probably violate a non-compete

109
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,239
but I feel like I can take better care

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,979
of the customer and I feel like I can

111
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,130
blah blah blah him all the reasons and I

112
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,659
was just expecting a big fight didn't

113
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,310
happen what he said was

114
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,910
oh wow I've always wanted to start my

115
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,730
own company I wish you good luck so I

116
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,020
did but the fact that I started it isn't

117
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,310
where I'm going to focus for the rest of

118
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,140
the presentation what I'm going to focus

119
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,840
on is I really curious about that

120
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,510
statement I wish I could start a company

121
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,000
but I never have so back to my story

122
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:51,060
eventually thirteen years after all that

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,520
a Dutch company purchased my company and

124
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,120
I won the game I went from one employee

125
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,859
meeting me to 21 nerds doing identity

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,330
and access management consulting and

127
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,500
eventually it was acquired by a Dutch

128
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:07,080
company so yay for Adam but let's circle

129
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,930
back to my manager I always wanted to

130
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,330
start a company so we get it right we

131
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,370
there's a lot of reasons that people

132
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,820
want to start companies there's a lot of

133
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,410
reasons that they give fine right but

134
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,870
what they're really saying is they want

135
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,610
freedom they want freedom to be in

136
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,770
charge of their time their money and

137
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,720
have autonomy to work on the things that

138
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,409
they want to work on and not be told

139
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,500
what to do so that's what I wanted right

140
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,170
when I left IBM I wanted to create a

141
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,450
company that let me take care of my

142
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,160
people and give them control over time

143
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,860
money autonomy I wanted to create a

144
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,080
different kind of company and that was

145
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,180
my big driving force so you don't want

146
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,010
to run from something if you run from

147
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,930
the pain the triggering event of being

148
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,570
in that Montgomery Alabama Airport for

149
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:57,090
18 hours eventually I won't be there and

150
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:00,419
the pain will go away you can use that

151
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:01,950
triggering event to be the catalyst to

152
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,450
move away from where you currently are

153
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,400
but if you're not running towards

154
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:08,130
something with a cool vision with a cool

155
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,099
something you're not gonna have the fuel

156
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,740
to get to where you want to go so why

157
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,720
didn't he do it why don't most of us do

158
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,880
it everyone wants freedom everyone wants

159
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,620
the things that were on those lists but

160
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,659
there's some really good reasons that

161
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,010
people don't first one is they tell

162
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,790
themselves that they don't have the time

163
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:28,409
to do it or the security to do it I had

164
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,880
a friend saying I'm you're so lucky you

165
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,919
started your businesses when you were

166
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,400
young I have kids I just can't afford to

167
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,900
take that risk or they see an

168
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,760
opportunity but they don't know if it's

169
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,380
a real business and they don't know how

170
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,210
to test to see if it's real business I

171
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,009
got this idea

172
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:45,318
I mean I really don't know is it a thing

173
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:48,979
should I do the thing I don't know and

174
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,810
the last is man business is daunting it

175
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:53,150
is a lot of moving parts and we're gonna

176
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,360
get into them today but it is a big

177
00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:00,258
heavy lift to just try to help

178
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,669
somebody's in the form of a business so

179
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,150
I've got good news

180
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:07,400
one does not simply walk away from one's

181
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,799
day job the worst thing you can do is

182
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,830
quit your day job to try to start a

183
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,820
company there's some caveats to that if

184
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,080
you already have customers who are

185
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,389
trying to pay you if you already have

186
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,219
all those things fine but at the end of

187
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,860
the day what you really don't want to do

188
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,440
is create more risk and more pressure by

189
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,770
not having an income I have a real good

190
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,440
buddy and she was the director of online

191
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,240
education for a major university and she

192
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,270
was globally known people were flying

193
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,590
her on their dime to lecture at

194
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,440
conferences in Hawaii and all over the

195
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,179
world and I said wow you were you've put

196
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,159
so much effort into this and you just

197
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,380
got more responsibility without more

198
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:47,419
money you must love this she said no I

199
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,800
hate this I hate this I don't feel

200
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:50,030
supported I don't have that I'm not

201
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,090
living the life I want to live and

202
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,440
doesn't want you go do it yourself and

203
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,948
she gave me the I don't have enough time

204
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,719
and I in this all right here we go my

205
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:04,430
suggestion to anyone who has that is

206
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:06,860
don't quit your day job but do give

207
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,810
yourself 30 minutes a night three nights

208
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,340
a week to work on your business and my

209
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,530
bet to her because I knew what she was

210
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:16,150
trying to do and I knew the market was I

211
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:20,359
bet you that if you give you do a

212
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,888
30-minute a night like skip one episode

213
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,139
of whatever your binge-watching and work

214
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:26,630
on your business instead three nights a

215
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:30,020
week I bet you you will be able to walk

216
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:33,229
away from your day job in three months

217
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,819
and if you don't I will give you 600

218
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:37,310
bottle six hundred dollar bottle of

219
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,140
scotch well I didn't have to give her

220
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:41,149
the Scotch she was out of her day job in

221
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,250
a month and a half because things move

222
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:46,100
quickly if you follow a system if you

223
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,770
understand what you're doing and if they

224
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,709
even if you don't you can go through and

225
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:54,110
spend a year starting your business at

226
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,130
night anyway what I'm saying is don't

227
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,780
walk away from your day job

228
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,939
let's jump into some of the better

229
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,680
questions here what is a business why

230
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,080
should I start wondering how do I do

231
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,870
that

232
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,690
what is a business a business is an

233
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:12,400
engine that creates wealth and that

234
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:16,490
wealth and that engine drive a vehicle

235
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,620
to a destination so the business itself

236
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,780
is not a destination it is a machine

237
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,730
that gives you power to do the things

238
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,130
that you want to do it's not good it's

239
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,890
not bad it's just a machine and that

240
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:30,650
machine is made up of customers who have

241
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:33,860
a problem that they need solved and you

242
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:36,560
have a solution that you can then tell

243
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,900
everybody about and then help them buy

244
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,489
that solution from you so that you're

245
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,500
sustainable and that they get what they

246
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,930
need and they're supported through your

247
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,510
operations of how you deliver your

248
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,910
solutions and how you help them support

249
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,980
it by your back-office this is all like

250
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,569
the accounting and the finances and all

251
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:58,670
the stuff the inner workings of the

252
00:09:53,570 --> 00:10:01,100
company mix with fuel and oil so you got

253
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,709
the engine but it doesn't run without

254
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,710
fuel and if it is running the whole

255
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:09,140
engine breaks down without the oil so

256
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:12,170
the fuel is money in the oil

257
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,150
our people guys this is a business

258
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,490
customers problems solution marketing

259
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,310
sales operation back-office people and

260
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,840
money and the money goes in and the

261
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,839
money gets generated and comes out and

262
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,150
this is an amazing little tool let's go

263
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:30,650
and look a little bit deeper about how a

264
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:33,250
business works revenue minus expenses

265
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:35,959
equals profit you need to generate

266
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,700
profit because profit is money and money

267
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:41,420
is fuel if your business isn't

268
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,070
generating profit then the engine

269
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,229
doesn't have gas to run and the whole

270
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:48,110
thing shuts down and you don't drive

271
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:50,960
anywhere but let's dive into what these

272
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,850
actually mean and this is gonna help you

273
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,340
understand even if you're not interested

274
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,780
in starting your own company or growing

275
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,150
your own company but just as a

276
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,650
cybersecurity practitioner who wants to

277
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,439
know how the insanity of the c-suite

278
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:06,709
works let me show you why all this stuff

279
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,110
goes on revenue you are selling a

280
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,120
product or service to a customer

281
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,040
that is your vice president of sales

282
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,600
that's your marketing department all

283
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,110
these people are trying to generate

284
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,790
revenue your expenses is the cost of

285
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,860
producing those products and services

286
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,500
and running the back office so that you

287
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:29,120
can have the solution that you can

288
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:32,330
actually sell and profit is the controls

289
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,330
that are put in place to manage those

290
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,670
two pipelines they're the revenue and

291
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,230
the expense pipeline quota that is the

292
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,410
requirements that the chief financial

293
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:45,620
officer puts on top of revenue saying

294
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:50,120
Vice President of Sales chief marketing

295
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,290
officer you must generate $100 each

296
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,380
month right

297
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:57,620
that is a quota go do that and then they

298
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:00,740
use budgets to control spending chief

299
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:04,070
operating officer you are only allowed

300
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,470
to spend 90 dollars a month and that way

301
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:09,440
the chief financial officer has

302
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,900
guaranteed to the CEO that if everything

303
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,640
goes according to plan that the business

304
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,130
will generate ten dollars a month

305
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,590
it's those controls that are most

306
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,200
interesting to me because those are the

307
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:23,180
things that make the engine run and if

308
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,150
you can understand quota and budget

309
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,670
revenue and expense then you can see why

310
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:31,340
cybersecurity is so important if a

311
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,949
breach happens and the expense for

312
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:38,120
production goes up let's say there is a

313
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:39,260
a critical breach and someone's hit them

314
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,940
with ransomware and they've locked

315
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,350
everything down and so now instead of

316
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,970
being able to produce whatever they're

317
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,460
trying to produce in the right amount of

318
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,370
time it takes longer and more expensive

319
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,830
now all the sudden your expenses have

320
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,810
shot through the roof and now your

321
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:57,260
revenue isn't there to support it and

322
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,880
you have negative profit or losses and

323
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,740
if you have losses and you don't have

324
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,900
enough fuel in the tank the business

325
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,810
will go out of business the company will

326
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,939
shut down so cyber security is here to

327
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,849
make sure that the controls that we put

328
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,350
in place to allow revenue minus expense

329
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,660
equals profit to work

330
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,570
we are the gatekeepers that makes your

331
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,430
business systems function and so if

332
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,390
that's our job we need to understand

333
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,760
business systems and not just technology

334
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:27,279
so Bravo for you for sitting through

335
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,529
this so what kind of businesses are

336
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,300
there well i classify them into three

337
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:33,310
different ways I am awesome which is

338
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,870
typically professional services I can

339
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,880
build it means you can build a product

340
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,560
or I know some people which means you're

341
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,149
a master networker and you can put

342
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,729
different things together like hey

343
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:43,779
you're a company who needs XYZ and I

344
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,019
know a couple other companies that

345
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:48,850
produce ABC let's get you all together I

346
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:51,100
am awesome is typically where we all

347
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,839
start this is professional services this

348
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,760
is training this is something that you

349
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,029
do you show up and you train an hour of

350
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,459
your time for a hourly rate or for a

351
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:03,279
retainer these guys are usually

352
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:04,930
self-employed but it quickly moves on to

353
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,120
where you can scale that that is exactly

354
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,739
what I did I did I am awesome identity

355
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,079
and access management consulting I

356
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,649
trained 21 other identity access

357
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:16,359
management consultants and then I began

358
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:20,290
to after those professional services out

359
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,029
there so I can build it that's when you

360
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,459
actually create a software product this

361
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:26,740
or or any other kind of product but in

362
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:29,349
my track record I have done many

363
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:32,620
software companies and these are very

364
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:34,269
hard because as a professional services

365
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,890
I am awesome if the customer gives you

366
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:37,449
feedback you can immediately change it

367
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:41,339
but if you're reselling somebody else's

368
00:14:37,449 --> 00:14:43,479
stuff like I was reselling IBM software

369
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,740
in if the customer didn't like the

370
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,839
software there's nothing I can do and

371
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,240
Lincoln scripting code so much around

372
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,279
the software to make dance but if the

373
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,079
customer wants something different and

374
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,339
the software doesn't do it it's real

375
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,260
hard to change that and even if you're

376
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:58,930
running your own software product this

377
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,550
can be a heavy lift I know some people

378
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,279
those are the communities out there

379
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,620
there's a lot of ways look there's value

380
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,240
in helping people know how to think

381
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,339
about a thing and there's value in

382
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,320
helping people find information about a

383
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:12,699
thing and connecting those folks who

384
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,079
need the information and have the

385
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:20,500
problem together not a huge draw to most

386
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,969
folks in cyber but it does exist so

387
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,640
here's what I want you to know whichever

388
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:26,500
one you pick our goal for you guys is

389
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,510
freedom what we want is freedom of time

390
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,160
freedom of money in autonomy on what you

391
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:33,189
work on and why not when you work on it

392
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,980
it that means that how you make your

393
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:38,500
money needs to be independent on

394
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,300
you spend your time which means you need

395
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,840
to build the engine and let the engine

396
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:46,900
run and not be a cog or a part of the

397
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,150
engine but rather you are the engineer

398
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,620
not the engine when you're getting

399
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,600
started it's completely fun to be the

400
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,760
engine you'll fill all of those roles

401
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,490
all those nine roles that I talked about

402
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,860
those are gonna be you but you want to

403
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,260
be in there with the intention of

404
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,540
setting up systems so that you can walk

405
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,830
away and do what you want and if you

406
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,010
really love one of those parts of the

407
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,880
engine feel free to do it but that's

408
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,540
that's gonna be a choice not a

409
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,030
requirement

410
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,410
you still haven't ahna me so business

411
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,600
works when you leverage these five

412
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,189
things you get the right people doing

413
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,830
the right processes inside of the right

414
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,390
systems solving a problem that people

415
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,420
care enough about that they're going to

416
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:27,490
pay you money to fix if all this is

417
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,990
happening boom you got yourself a

418
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,390
business then it's all a matter of

419
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,310
getting the engine tuned and doing the

420
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,260
right things so let's answer this

421
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,390
question and should I start a business

422
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:41,590
and I will give you a pretty good answer

423
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:43,300
this is maybe maybe you should I used to

424
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:45,550
believe entrepreneurship was a silver

425
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:49,000
bullet and then I realized that it is

426
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,949
not the silver bullet it is very very

427
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,090
difficult what I thought I was getting

428
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:56,680
in for was a different kind of ride it

429
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,140
is not the way you're going to make the

430
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,359
most amount of money we entrepreneurs we

431
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,010
have high highs and lows lows we the

432
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,870
things that stress my family out the

433
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,900
most is the in predictability of

434
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:09,339
entrepreneurship sometimes people say

435
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,400
they'll pay check your paycheck when an

436
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:14,409
entrepreneur often lives exit to exit if

437
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,570
the company doesn't do well you don't

438
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:20,830
have any insurance it's the buck stops

439
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:23,470
with you but you also have control and

440
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:26,319
you can roll up your sleeves for me it

441
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:29,590
was far more risky to be a number on a

442
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,840
giant IBM spreadsheet that some CFO

443
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:34,899
somewhere can decide I was too expensive

444
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,490
and I needed to be laid off at least

445
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:40,120
when I'm running the engine I have

446
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:42,040
control I have the ability to get off my

447
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,229
butt and make more phone calls to try to

448
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,600
contact more people to find out if they

449
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,090
have a problem I can help with so for me

450
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,870
the risk of doing nothing was greater

451
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,870
and

452
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,129
and some of the risks of the

453
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,330
uncontrolled

454
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,750
innothing uncontrolled the the in

455
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,550
predictability of entrepreneurship but

456
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,559
before you can do any of that what you

457
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,450
have to do is answer this answer this

458
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:08,200
question what is the vision that you

459
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:10,660
have for your future if your vision for

460
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,610
the future is compelling enough that you

461
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,500
can deal with some of the stresses that

462
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:16,870
you can be resilient enough to go after

463
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,840
that then you should totally give it a

464
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,280
shot I absolutely agree with that and if

465
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,350
you do it in the right kind of way it

466
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,790
doesn't have to put you at a huge amount

467
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:29,439
of risk so I am going to narrow it down

468
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,629
I'm throwing away autonomy I'm gonna

469
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,429
look at two things we're gonna look at

470
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,020
time and money for when you have to do

471
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:37,390
your vision because what I'm assuming

472
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,100
and what I am positing to you is if you

473
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,350
have control over your time and you have

474
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:45,100
control over your money then your

475
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:49,840
autonomy comes naturally that's a pretty

476
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:51,580
big assumption but you know that's just

477
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,080
where I'm gonna sit and also it helps

478
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,780
this next graph because I don't want to

479
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,330
put it on me in here although I guess we

480
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:05,110
could look an employee trays there time

481
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:07,928
for money you show up and you do a thing

482
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:10,600
and someone pays you so the more

483
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:13,420
valuable the thing you do to the company

484
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,949
either you lower expenses by doing

485
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,140
something amazing that makes it super

486
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:18,730
efficient or you increase revenue by

487
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,770
creating a new product that someone can

488
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,530
sell or you help with getting customers

489
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:26,139
supported things like that so if you are

490
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:29,440
providing value into that equation then

491
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,910
they give you more money if you they if

492
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,250
you don't put value into that equation

493
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,690
and you're a commodity inside that you

494
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,020
get less money so that's not an employee

495
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,520
earns money self-employed are people who

496
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,160
trade time and money and take some of

497
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,210
the responsibility and risk in exchange

498
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,210
for more money these are your

499
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,040
contractors these are your general

500
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:52,270
consultants who handle a lot of the back

501
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:55,659
office stuff an employee for example and

502
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:58,060
I'm gonna use back of the napkin math an

503
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:01,090
employee when I am calculating how much

504
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:03,790
they cost me I take their salary times

505
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:07,959
0.15 that's all the fully

506
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:10,320
rate for insurance for travel for blah

507
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,640
blah blah all the things right training

508
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,530
the self-employed person doesn't get the

509
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,420
benefits of that and so when you're

510
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,830
setting yourself employment you have to

511
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:21,940
make sure that you're getting paid at

512
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:23,830
least 1.5% or 1.5 times more than what

513
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,770
your salary is in order to have the same

514
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,449
lifestyle that is a risky thing and so

515
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,800
that's why people are gonna do our

516
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,170
self-employed well how do I do prices

517
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,450
that's important and then business owner

518
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,580
they build systems that trade other

519
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,020
people's time for money

520
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,970
meaning they build systems that

521
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,520
employees can succeed in to produce

522
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,350
value and then here's the last one

523
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,550
trades money for money guys I'm not even

524
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,260
gonna talk about I want to have no idea

525
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:51,580
how to do that I'm very bad at investing

526
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:53,080
let's move on I gave so we're talking

527
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,020
about time and money so I gave another

528
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,389
talk at a earlier besides about show me

529
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,620
the money how cyber security people make

530
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,990
money and I said there are three tracks

531
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,149
the technology track the executive track

532
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,470
from the entrepreneur track and I have

533
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,600
to tell you I've had a lot of

534
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,160
conversations with some of my drinking

535
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,610
buddies who are now vice presidents

536
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:15,190
inside of companies and haha who would

537
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:17,679
have thought well done guys but that's

538
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,750
the thing is the executive track in the

539
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:22,060
technology track or senior technology

540
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:25,360
person they can make a whole lot of

541
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:29,440
money with a lot less risk if you can

542
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,570
win in that particular track the

543
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,320
entrepreneur track has a lot of chaos

544
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:38,230
and most entrepreneurs I know make

545
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,090
enough money that they are successful

546
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,610
these are a lifetime on lifestyle

547
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:45,129
entrepreneurs most entrepreneurs are not

548
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,600
creating google most entrepreneurs make

549
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,690
a couple hundred thousand dollars a year

550
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,969
have some freedom of time have some

551
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,110
autonomy and are very very happy when

552
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,580
things are going well but there's an

553
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,659
awful lot of stress that goes in that if

554
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,080
you don't approach it in the right way

555
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,910
but I could not survive the technology

556
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,949
tracked and I could not survive in the

557
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,140
executive track because I am programmed

558
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,570
to be an entrepreneur and maybe that is

559
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,430
you too so let's talk about if you

560
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,770
choose to do the entrepreneur track and

561
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:15,280
we talked about the engine now you need

562
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:17,560
to envision your vehicle so if your

563
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,389
vision was I want to help people

564
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,639
and I want to do all this stuff and

565
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:25,240
you're gonna build yourself an ambulance

566
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:27,190
right or maybe what you wanted is to hey

567
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,450
I'm gonna help move this dirt around

568
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,970
well you're gonna need a dump truck

569
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:34,000
right and the engine you build for each

570
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:38,650
one of these vehicles to accomplish your

571
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,860
vision is different a dump trucks engine

572
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,870
will not serve Ricky Bobby in number 51

573
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,030
because he wants to be first because he

574
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,580
knows he's not he's gonna be last and

575
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,560
that engine just doesn't work so as you

576
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,820
discover your vision your mission what

577
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,250
you're trying to get done

578
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,189
you can reverse engineer through design

579
00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:01,330
based thinking what kind of engine you

580
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:03,880
need to move that vehicle by the way I

581
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,370
absolutely love my last bullet point

582
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,050
because I'm just picturing a clown car

583
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,439
trying to save people's lives and like

584
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:14,260
you know ER a EMT guys just pouring out

585
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,560
of it anyway that was fun for me to

586
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,700
imagine I hope you enjoyed it - all

587
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,909
right so let's get in the nuts and the

588
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:24,940
bolts how do I start my business there

589
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:27,700
are four phases for launching a business

590
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,870
it starts with ideation what can I do

591
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,330
let's come up with a whole bunch of

592
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:34,149
ideas all right now we've narrowed the

593
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:36,639
ideas down from hundreds to a few let's

594
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,860
test them all right after we have

595
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,420
validation from our tests that we've got

596
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,939
the right thing let's build it

597
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,650
and if you build it and you get a few

598
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,740
customers who pay you you have entered

599
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:50,170
startup mode and startup mode is the

600
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:54,580
starting line think of all of this as

601
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:57,010
training for a race this is all the prep

602
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,850
work you do before you get into a game

603
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:03,250
right so ID eight test build startup

604
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,379
let's go through them all ideation is

605
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,540
the process for coming up with business

606
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:10,060
models business ideas and all of the

607
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,550
things you defined the idea you generate

608
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,690
and you define your target meaning what

609
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:17,030
is my goal

610
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,400
generate the ideas a whole bunch of them

611
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:21,310
collect them but I'm in a bucket analyze

612
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,690
them and then act on the one you choose

613
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:25,100
so let's look at define define is

614
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:29,060
getting extreme Claire you know what

615
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:31,850
your goal is I love that quote from

616
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:34,550
president Santos of Colombia said that

617
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,919
if you do not have a destination port

618
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:40,129
your boat just sails around all the time

619
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,600
and eventually sinks so you have to have

620
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,700
a goal in mind otherwise you're gonna

621
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,909
spend a lot of energy be very very busy

622
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,800
but not produce anything of value and so

623
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,910
having your target in mind is very very

624
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,520
important and there's some good

625
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,200
goal-setting exercises I can help you

626
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,730
guys with but in general it's how do you

627
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,320
pick your goal and then how do you

628
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,020
reverse engineer back and now that you

629
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,189
have a goal in mind for example I had a

630
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,320
goal I want to make thirty thousand

631
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:08,000
dollars a month I only wanted to work 20

632
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,620
hours a week and I wanted to spend more

633
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,660
time traveling so those were some of my

634
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,969
goals and now an ideated business around

635
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,560
it that's what I do so we came up with

636
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,910
all these ideas okay you put all these

637
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,710
ideas what can I do what can I do who

638
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:23,150
can I help what can I do boom boom boom

639
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:24,680
you come with us as many possible ideas

640
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,570
as you can and then you organize them

641
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,010
most of the time they're gonna notice a

642
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:30,010
couple themes come up and you start

643
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:33,560
organizing them around these themes and

644
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:36,200
then you need to analyze I love this

645
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,570
because I did this this graphic here you

646
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,720
got neo and you've got all of these

647
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:44,720
ideas coming his way oh man he has to

648
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,910
slow down in order to go fast before he

649
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,030
can pick a bullet out of that whole mix

650
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,410
he has to slow all the ideas down and so

651
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,990
you're switching gears from this

652
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,330
fast-paced ideation I did generation

653
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,180
it's a whole lot of fun to slow down and

654
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:01,129
let's go look at each and every one of

655
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,920
these things and what you do is you take

656
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:06,080
some of the winners that obviously go

657
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,960
that you resonate with and you create a

658
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,970
graph and on one side you have a bunch

659
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,310
of rows that have all the ideas in it

660
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,380
along the top columns you have things

661
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,290
you measure how difficult is this to be

662
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,800
how expensive is this can I do it on my

663
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,389
own

664
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,610
can I do it at night what's the next

665
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:24,170
step and so what you'll have is a whole

666
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,459
bunch of really really good ideas but

667
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:28,290
you're only going to have two maybe

668
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,630
three that match your goal

669
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,790
and the time that you have and the risk

670
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,290
you're willing to adopt and all these

671
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,940
things and I want you to be very

672
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:37,649
comfortable with having a lot of really

673
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,090
really good ideas but knowing that the

674
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,590
constraints that you're currently under

675
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,810
means that you're only gonna be able to

676
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:44,790
approach a few of these keep the rest of

677
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,350
them in your back pocket a cool thing

678
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,300
about business is you can always launch

679
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:51,510
more once the system is running you can

680
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,070
go play and then you have to act and you

681
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,100
have to choose when you look at that

682
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,240
matrix you look at the matrix I like

683
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,990
what I did there that was

684
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,220
unintentionally intentional once you

685
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,610
look at your matrix you'll be able to

686
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:09,480
see that there are a few winners and

687
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:11,969
you'll pick one maybe two and then you

688
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,860
won't begin to truly act on it and

689
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,050
analyze it and this is how you're going

690
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,610
to do that after you pick one or two

691
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:19,860
you're gonna create what we call a lean

692
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,770
business canvas in this lean business

693
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,240
canvas is how you organize your ideas

694
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:26,100
you're going to define the customer

695
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,230
you're trying to help you're going to

696
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,449
outline the one two three maybe couple

697
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,370
problems that they are experiencing that

698
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,110
you think they need to have solved

699
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,270
you're going to list what they're

700
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,030
currently doing that makes those

701
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:42,930
problems that that did address those

702
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:45,270
problems right you're gonna list a

703
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,760
couple of solutions for each one of

704
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,350
those problems then you're gonna say hey

705
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,570
look of these solutions this is the

706
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:54,209
unique value that I bring inside those

707
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,620
solutions that makes me stand out I'm

708
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,680
gonna come up with a cool metaphor

709
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:01,620
I am the this of that I am the uber of

710
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:07,170
YouTube I am the blah blah blah right

711
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:09,510
I am the Netflix of cyber karaoke maybe

712
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:12,210
whatever that is

713
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:15,150
what's my unfair advantage I had a buddy

714
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:18,360
who's unfair advantage he was in a

715
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:21,150
staffing agency was he was married to

716
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,909
the daughter of a vice president and a

717
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:26,490
major corporation and so that guy just

718
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,770
bought all of his staffing needs from

719
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:32,070
his son-in-law that's an unfair

720
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:34,710
advantage and that is it is it ethical

721
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,210
is it not I don't know probably not but

722
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,550
at the end of the day you have to have

723
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,780
some kind of unfair advantage it could

724
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,240
be who you know it can be your

725
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,460
background it can be all kinds of stuff

726
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,040
but in order for you to get started and

727
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,500
get into the markets there has to be

728
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:52,409
some kind of unfair advantage and don't

729
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,820
worry you have won and you can discover

730
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:55,530
it a lot of us would be like I got

731
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,810
nothing no trust me if you are breathing

732
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,160
you have an unfair advantage in some

733
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,200
form or fashion that we can figure it

734
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,150
out then chalice is all about how people

735
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,660
want to buy from you this is how do I

736
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:09,270
tell my customers about my unique value

737
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,250
proposition and about how I can solve

738
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:14,250
their problems in a way that doesn't

739
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,960
make them mad in a way that lets them

740
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:18,780
know about it and then encourages them

741
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:21,420
to take an action and that action is to

742
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,280
purchase one of our products based off

743
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,710
of our solutions that's your revenue

744
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,080
streams and then you have to understand

745
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,750
how much is a cost to run all the parts

746
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,610
of the company hey guess what none of

747
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:35,190
this matters of you if you're not

748
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:37,050
measuring it what do they say expect

749
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,640
what you inspect you have to come up

750
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,290
with a list of key metrics that lets you

751
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,820
know how all of these parts are running

752
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,560
guess what that is guys that's your back

753
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,899
office your back office is looking at

754
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,010
all this boom that's the same graphic

755
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,559
done in a different way

756
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:54,279
the engine

757
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,720
is organized and it makes sense but

758
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,970
you're still just doing this you're

759
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,679
building an engine customers problem

760
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,899
solution marketing sales operations back

761
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,249
off as money in people that will produce

762
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:05,709
a result this is what this might look

763
00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:07,149
like I'd like to put this up on a giant

764
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,009
whiteboard draw some lines and use

765
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:10,299
sticky notes because you're gonna make

766
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:11,769
some assumptions and you're gonna test

767
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:13,779
them you're gonna be wrong and they're

768
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:16,059
gonna rip the sticky note off boom cut

769
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:19,230
it back on this is an amazing tool

770
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:22,539
because this is a replacement to a

771
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:24,399
business plan you do not need a business

772
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:26,080
plan at this point do not write a

773
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,830
20-page business plan with five-year

774
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,899
projections

775
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,519
that's called creating writing and that

776
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:32,469
should be in the English department not

777
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:34,450
in the business department you don't

778
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,970
know enough right now about your company

779
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:41,169
to write a business plan you need a lean

780
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:43,450
canvas so how do you understand if this

781
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:45,279
stuff you put on the canvas works well

782
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,629
you have to test it that means you're

783
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,399
going to go through and talk to people

784
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:50,049
potential customers with a problem

785
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,658
interview you're going to do data

786
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:54,549
analysis on what they got they give you

787
00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:57,190
the feedback then you're going to create

788
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:59,279
a document that outlines your

789
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,840
conclusions and go back to those same

790
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,730
customers potential customers and say I

791
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,199
think I have a solution would you look

792
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,669
at it

793
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,230
so the problem interview I want you to

794
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:10,509
go talk to a hundred people that is a

795
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,490
kind of air quotes a hundred but you

796
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:13,779
need to talk to a large section of

797
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:16,769
people and I'll get into why that's

798
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:19,809
important later in order to understand

799
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:21,909
have you clearly defined the problem do

800
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:24,970
you understand the existing alternatives

801
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:28,090
and what is the pain and what triggers

802
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:30,580
it so you want to know who has the pain

803
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:33,340
and what triggers it if it's a chief

804
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:38,309
information security officer si ISO has

805
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:42,279
the pain they're not able to do auditing

806
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:43,629
in a timely matter what triggers that

807
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,860
pain well the thing that triggers the

808
00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:46,719
pain is the fact that they don't have

809
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,299
what they need in order to report to the

810
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,570
CIO or briefed the board of directors

811
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:54,580
and if that's what causes the pain that

812
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,559
that's what triggers the pain you need

813
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,750
to know that because then your solution

814
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,309
has to say look not only can I complete

815
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,869
these audits for you but I can deliver

816
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:03,779
them in a timely way that let makes you

817
00:32:01,869 --> 00:32:05,399
look like a rock star in front

818
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:08,309
your board of directors you see how

819
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:10,709
that's a different solution then I just

820
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:12,090
do audits no no I do audits in a timely

821
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:14,580
fashion that makes you look like a rock

822
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:16,468
star from the Board of Directors so you

823
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,619
will learn that by having conversations

824
00:32:16,469 --> 00:32:21,629
with people after that you take the data

825
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:23,728
and you run through it you review it you

826
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:25,259
define trends and insights and you

827
00:32:23,729 --> 00:32:27,269
develop possible solutions this is

828
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:28,979
another matrix so you put together that

829
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:30,690
tracks all this stuff and then you

830
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:32,249
develop solutions and look near the

831
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,239
reason that you're doing this is

832
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:34,409
probably because you know a little

833
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,619
something about what you're talking

834
00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:36,599
about

835
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,549
and so it's real important not to be

836
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:41,009
bias about the solutions in your head

837
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:42,929
saying well I am really good at access

838
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:45,149
management in the dendy management so

839
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:47,609
every problem is an ldap problem or a

840
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:49,859
portal problem or whatever problem and

841
00:32:47,609 --> 00:32:52,259
therefore my solutions no you need to be

842
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:53,428
open-minded about this by this point and

843
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:55,289
then you have to be honest with yourself

844
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,969
can you create a solution or do you know

845
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:59,249
somebody who can create the solution

846
00:32:56,969 --> 00:33:00,539
that meets these people's needs and then

847
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:02,729
you go back to them and say hey look

848
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:05,759
guys here's a report I talked to a

849
00:33:02,729 --> 00:33:07,440
hundred people like you I aggregated all

850
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:11,519
of your information and I created a

851
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,339
industry report on problems bla and

852
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,830
here's my findings by the way these are

853
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:19,379
the solutions I came up with I believe

854
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,478
these two or three are the best ones but

855
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:23,908
this one right here is my favorite this

856
00:33:21,479 --> 00:33:25,499
is what I'm thinking about charging for

857
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:27,929
it based off of what industries are

858
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:29,549
doing about industry standards and when

859
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:32,609
you're beginning to come up with a price

860
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:34,200
for your solution there's so many moving

861
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:36,178
parts in this you don't need to test

862
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,979
pricing right now what you need to do is

863
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:40,409
charge what everybody else is already

864
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:44,369
charging if everybody in your industry

865
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:47,369
is charging 250 dollars an hour for

866
00:33:44,369 --> 00:33:50,820
cyber auditing and you're doing a cyber

867
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:53,968
auditing company charge 250 dollars an

868
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,229
hour but for your early adopters you can

869
00:33:53,969 --> 00:33:58,379
say well because you're helping me get

870
00:33:55,229 --> 00:34:00,509
started I will reduce my price by 20%

871
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:01,559
for you or something like that but don't

872
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:03,210
lead with that

873
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:05,729
give them the price that they are

874
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:07,679
expecting to pay because often you will

875
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:09,990
bring risk into the market into your

876
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,029
your customer if they under pay you

877
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:14,279
because if something goes wrong and

878
00:34:12,029 --> 00:34:15,629
they'll you don't pay enough you're they

879
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:17,370
going to be held accountable it's weird

880
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:20,730
it's very weird how this budget

881
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:22,319
and quotas stuff works but don't try to

882
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,870
figure it out just charge what everyone

883
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,800
else is paying right now as long as it

884
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:30,600
fits into your business canvas all right

885
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,280
so now you're gonna build you got

886
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,460
customers who are like hey this is great

887
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,320
I do want that but guess what you talk

888
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:40,650
to a hundred of them and only ten want

889
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,460
it and let's see where is that yeah only

890
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:46,620
ten want it because look at this

891
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:49,260
customers their psychology going on here

892
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,270
and not everybody in that hundred even

893
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,890
if all 100 of them agreed that those are

894
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,900
the problems and your solution is

895
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:58,620
absolutely the one that they need only

896
00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:01,830
about 15 of them are gonna buy 15 or 16

897
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:05,339
because the early majority late majority

898
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:06,720
and laggards need more proof that you

899
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,970
can do what your going to do these

900
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,399
people buy IBM or are called big-box

901
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:15,240
shop they do not take a risk on the

902
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,220
boutique curated security firm that's

903
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:19,799
your innovators and early adopters and

904
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:23,730
so what you could get is very very

905
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,040
depressed if you only get 15 people only

906
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,410
get 10 people of the hundred that you

907
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,390
interviewed to buy your product service

908
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,450
because you can say like nobody wants

909
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,670
this know you getting false negatives if

910
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:37,950
somebody in the late majority tells me I

911
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,780
don't want that tells me that they don't

912
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,879
want my product or service then I know

913
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,040
it isn't that it's not my stuff is bad

914
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,200
it's just I don't have a company with

915
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,940
the reputation that makes it safe for

916
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,980
them to buy from me because every single

917
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:53,250
one of these people has to justify their

918
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:55,080
decision to somebody else so you are

919
00:35:53,250 --> 00:36:00,090
going to be hunting for your innovators

920
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:01,710
and your early adopters right so now

921
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:04,470
you're gonna deliver the solution and

922
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,890
get feedback but your solution is not

923
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:10,129
perfect at this point your solution is

924
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:13,160
probably not that great at all because

925
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:16,020
we're doing a Minimum Viable Product

926
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,609
let's pretend that we know what the end

927
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:21,180
product that we want them to have is a

928
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:22,470
Jeep and so what we do typically this is

929
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,089
Ari I'm gonna sell you Jeep you need a

930
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,730
Jeep your problem is transportation I

931
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,650
think it Jeep is exactly what you need

932
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,600
so I'm gonna spend a couple months

933
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,050
building wheel then the the frame and

934
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,569
then

935
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:35,010
right and at the end of the day you get

936
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,780
the Jeep well let me tell you what

937
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,160
happens when you do that I had a company

938
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,180
called Atlas fault we did cybersecurity

939
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,089
compliance and reporting self

940
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:47,370
assessments inside of a large supply

941
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:49,770
chains so they did self assessments all

942
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:51,540
the stuff was great I spent six hundred

943
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,840
and fifty thousand dollars doing the

944
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:57,230
top-line we built the database we

945
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,730
integrated with procurement software we

946
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:02,160
built that we got the NIST assessments

947
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:06,570
going and we got the user interface we

948
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:09,870
were the turbo tax for cyber compliance

949
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:11,460
and was delightful knows a dumpster fire

950
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,750
because by the time we were done with it

951
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,420
we created something that only worked

952
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:17,220
for one customer and no one else wanted

953
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,070
it and I've had to shut the company down

954
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,500
after two years of development well

955
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:24,110
here's what a real MSP is if the problem

956
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,480
is transportation

957
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:28,770
there are a lot of right answers and if

958
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,900
you really ask the person with the

959
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,460
problem is like well I'm barefoot and I

960
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,410
didn't got to walk across hot asphalt

961
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,390
but you know what will help them a

962
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:38,370
skateboard and you can build that fast

963
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,890
and then what you do is you test here's

964
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,940
my first product you said your problem

965
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,190
was you don't want to bring your feet

966
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:46,110
walking across hot asphalt here's a

967
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:48,360
skateboard you can roll across it great

968
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:51,930
well now I want you to picture a bunch

969
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,940
of you know old people old executives

970
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:56,100
riding skateboards it's hilarious and

971
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,890
dangerous so what do we do we tested and

972
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:01,650
then we designed another product and

973
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:04,170
that was a like a razor that had like

974
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,060
handlebars great much better the

975
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:07,170
balancing is fixed but now it turns out

976
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,210
people are getting tired so we've got a

977
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,160
bicycle with a seat people get tired

978
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,750
pedaling now we put a motor in it and by

979
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,819
the time you're done you do get to a

980
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,200
point in time when you have a Jeep that

981
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,580
has a lot of people studying inside

982
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,379
that's protected from weather and all

983
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,990
this stuff but if I tried at the

984
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,430
beginning of the skateboard level to

985
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:25,470
create all of the infrastructure

986
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:28,200
necessary to create a safe vehicle that

987
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:30,470
was approved and roadworthy and

988
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,850
emissions and all of these other things

989
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:35,640
my company goes into the dumpster and I

990
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:38,460
light it on fire you have to do small

991
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,560
MVP Minimum Viable Product testing and

992
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,840
development so you don't go out of

993
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,420
business if you are trying to start a

994
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,820
travel company a transportation company

995
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,100
thirty-eight minutes a night three

996
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:53,960
nights a week you can't build a jeep but

997
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,220
you sure can build a skateboard right so

998
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,700
another little warning this is about

999
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:01,410
false positives and false negatives we

1000
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,620
had one customer who wanted the product

1001
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,330
that was an early adopter I thought that

1002
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,569
the entire market needed my product they

1003
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:12,980
did not I did not talk to a hundred CI

1004
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:15,120
SOS about how they were handling

1005
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,400
transparency of cyber risk in their

1006
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,589
supply chain and I wasted a bunch of

1007
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,140
money so now you deliver the solution

1008
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:24,360
and it's very simple you do the work in

1009
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,160
an amazing way you get feedback and then

1010
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,530
you ask for referrals and when you're

1011
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,629
doing the work something will go wrong

1012
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,130
you don't have a real customer until

1013
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:34,710
something goes wrong and then you fix it

1014
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:36,900
in a way that delights them right we've

1015
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:40,500
all been on the call where someone

1016
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,640
complains let's pretend websites down

1017
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,930
and you get everybody on that big

1018
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,850
conference call and everyone's like it's

1019
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,649
not DNS and it's another firewall it's

1020
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:48,270
not access management it's not this is

1021
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,400
not websphere it's not blah blah blah

1022
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:52,410
everyone gets on the phone saying who it

1023
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,510
isn't if you're the one person who gets

1024
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,190
on the phone and say I don't know who it

1025
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:57,750
is but I'm gonna look into this I'm

1026
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,490
gonna take responsibility for my side

1027
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:01,830
I'm gonna be a problem solver I'm gonna

1028
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,600

you provide amazing customer service

1030
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,970

work handle things when the things go

1035
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,100
wrong and then you ask for referrals

1036
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,710
those 10 customers you got from those

1037
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:25,080
hundred interviews will give you another

1038
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:27,780
customer and again and again and

1039
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,360

00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,440
pain points of not enough time not

1090
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:33,060
enough security not knowing if you

1091
