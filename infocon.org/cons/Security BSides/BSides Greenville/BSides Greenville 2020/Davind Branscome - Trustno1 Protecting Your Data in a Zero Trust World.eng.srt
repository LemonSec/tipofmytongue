1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,549
all right so name this presentation is

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,820
trust no one protecting your data in a

3
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:15,469
zero trust world my name is David Raskin

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,650
I'm a senior security architect at

5
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:20,570
Microsoft this is me I'm based out of

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,140
Raleigh North Carolina had been with

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:28,400
Microsoft going into my thirteenth year

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:30,170
and 20 years in the industry multiple

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,759
jobs in Microsoft Microsoft consulting

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,320
services premier and now I work with

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:39,200
Microsoft partners bunch of

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:43,160
certifications and I would love to be at

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,710
the beach now if this this pandemic

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,099
would ease up a little bit but in any

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,260
case

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,579
here's where I show you how tragically

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:56,570
old I actually am so how many of you

18
00:00:52,579 --> 00:01:00,040
remember 1998 what is it you remember

19
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,040
about 1998

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:09,580
West Bailey's raisins can anybody

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:12,310
remember these two that doesn't look

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:16,780
like Hillary Clinton I wonder who that

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:20,200
was I remember having one of these so

24
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:24,250
many discman walkman depending on what

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,060
flavor you got some of you might

26
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,910
remember this game where Michael Jordan

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,600
was playing with the flu and one in the

28
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:38,399
last couple seconds and a little company

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,399
named Google got started in 1998

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,170
only other things that happened this is

31
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:47,550
one of the things I remember from 1998

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,710
so at the time I was working in the

33
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:51,119
stock exchange in San Francisco when

34
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,190
there was a stock exchange in San

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,330
Francisco and I was in the networking

36
00:01:53,190 --> 00:02:00,720
department and Novell was ruling the day

37
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:04,979
at the time we managed GroupWise system

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,300
and yes and it was rock solid we loved

39
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,800
it it was fantastic

40
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:14,459
and this little upstart Windows NT in

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,190
Windows 2000 we were told start learning

42
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,920
it and started wondering what Active

43
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:24,120
Directory was and how could used in the

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,359
in the network so I started learning

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,920
that I was actually in charge of one of

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,239
the security departments there at the

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,980
Stock Exchange and at the time I had

48
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,860
what I thought was a pretty and

49
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,140
guessable password trust no one

50
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:45,510
now what's funny about this is that on

51
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:48,869
July 16 1998 cert reported there was an

52
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,480
incident where an attacker had found a

53
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,900
hundred eighty six thousand encrypted

54
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,899
passwords and at the time that the the

55
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,760
attacker was discovered forty-seven

56
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,579
thousand of those passwords had already

57
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,980
been cracked and sometimes I wondered

58
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:06,989
you know looking back now if one of my

59
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,540
passwords had actually been in that

60
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:15,600
Metcash and the reason I wonder that is

61
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:19,200
because if we fast forward 15 years to

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,700
the year 2013

63
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,310
by this point that was working at

64
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,260
Microsoft and my security practices I

65
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,800
think were moderately better than they

66
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:33,480
were back in 2001 or 1998 actually is

67
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,940
when I originally started but I had kind

68
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:40,350
of gotten into security in a much bigger

69
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,540
way and you know I liked nosing around

70
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,560
on the dark web and taking a look at

71
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,440
different things

72
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,480
and one of the things that I like to

73
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,910
look for is password caches and there

74
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,049
was one on paste bin and I was looking

75
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:58,790
through it and as you can see here there

76
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:03,569
was my password at number nine on the

77
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:05,970
password guessing text file that was

78
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:07,980
there on paste bin so that was a little

79
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,430
unnerving I wasn't real happy about that

80
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:14,100
but my password was slightly better than

81
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:17,639
letting me in and a little bit worse

82
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:21,389
than dragon and a little bit better than

83
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,210
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so that was that was a

84
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:29,190
little bit of an eye-opener some of you

85
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:32,969
may be familiar with a website called if

86
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,890
information is beautiful and they do

87
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:38,940
word clouds and this is a word cloud

88
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:41,669
that they did for common passwords and

89
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,870
if you notice there's my password again

90
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:44,969
trust no one

91
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,500
there's some other ones in there that

92
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:51,930
are pretty obvious

93
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:55,770
you see NCC 1701 that's a reference

94
00:04:51,930 --> 00:05:00,840
obviously to Star Trek rush 2112 and

95
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:02,219
ou812 or rush and Van Halen records and

96
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,229
then a whole bunch of other ones Jordan

97
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,560
23 bond double-oh-seven

98
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:10,260
whole bunch of just common names and

99
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,190
phrases that people like but this was

100
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:16,919
you know again the higher up you are and

101
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:20,789
the bigger you are means that the the

102
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:23,520
more targeted that password was so trust

103
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:28,710
no one was no longer a password that I

104
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:31,140
could reliably use in any sense let's

105
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,789
move forward a couple more years to 2019

106
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:37,500
so we're looking back

107
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:40,770
on 2019 now Microsoft did some research

108
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:45,450
and one of the things that they found is

109
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:48,539
that by 2021 25 percent of the world's

110
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:51,180
personal data will be compromised and

111
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,340
housed in a data Lake that can be

112
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,150
analyzed and utilized by consortiums and

113
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:01,469
threat actors so things like passwords

114
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:04,020
Social Security numbers credit card

115
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,240
numbers all this kind of stuff about 25

116
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,520
percent of everybody in the world's

117
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,230
personal data will be available in this

118
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:18,870
massive data repository that will be

119
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:22,300
shared by these threat actors

120
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,210
we've seen 750 percent growth in the

121
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:29,590
number of ransomware families I just in

122
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:33,870
2016 now if you think about this 2016

123
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:38,710
predates the petty had not Petya

124
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:40,330
ransomware attack the samsam attack some

125
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,530
of the more prominent ones that have

126
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,859
come out in the last two or three years

127
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:50,559
and we saw 700 percent growth back then

128
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:53,320
so we can reliably assume that the

129
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:59,100
growth has been just not comparable or

130
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,099
even faster in the years since 2016

131
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,849
and the third thing is that by 2022 a

132
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,439
third of successful attacks experienced

133
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:10,930
by enterprises will be on their shadow

134
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:12,789
IT resources now when we talk about

135
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,969
shadow IT resources we'll be talking

136
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:20,318
about our services or applications or

137
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:23,710
cloud applications that departments

138
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,229
within an organization may acquire for

139
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,378
their own use without the knowledge of

140
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:31,449
central IT and the reason that's a

141
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:34,240
threat is because that if central IT is

142
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:37,419
and securing them then it's very likely

143
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,449
that nobody is securing them so so what

144
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:42,789
these things all put together lead us to

145
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:45,520
is my password

146
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:50,979
trust no one we really can't trust

147
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:53,229
anybody to protect our personal data you

148
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:56,699
have to be able to to trust our own

149
00:07:53,229 --> 00:08:00,159
machines we have to be able to trust the

150
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:04,330
reliability and safety of our cloud app

151
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:07,930
resources so let's take a look at it

152
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:11,680
what we can do to fix this problem now

153
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,569
this is kind of a metaphor for what

154
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,839
security used to look like right

155
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:19,180
he had a firewall people would try to

156
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:22,149
get in there was a door it was mostly

157
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,319
closed traffic was right you could get

158
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:25,419
right in no problem

159
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:29,080
like that but that's no longer the way

160
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:30,878
things work we now have this concept of

161
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,559
zero trust and and I recognize that

162
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,139
Microsoft isn't the one that came up

163
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:38,018
with the phrase zero trust we're not the

164
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:41,549
only ones that have a methodology around

165
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:44,290
zero trust the way that Microsoft views

166
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:47,949
implementing zero trust is outlined in

167
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,930
this URL at the bottom a kms slash zero

168
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:52,089
trust and so what we're going to try to

169
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:55,209
do over the next couple of minutes and

170
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:58,720
with some demos is show what zero trust

171
00:08:55,209 --> 00:09:02,439
is the three principles behind how

172
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,120
Microsoft looks at zero trust and if

173
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,350
you're running a Microsoft network what

174
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,930
are some ways that you can implement

175
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:11,450
zero trust on that network as well

176
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:14,839
so first of all what is zero trust me

177
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:19,100
the principle behind zero trust from a

178
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:22,520
microsoft perspective is that we don't

179
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:26,110
trust anybody to access data unless they

180
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,819
have explicitly proven themselves to be

181
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,640
who they say they are that they're

182
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,990
connecting from a trusted device and

183
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:40,279
that they have a right to know or right

184
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:42,260
to that data so in other words I've got

185
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:45,410
a user that's logging in on a machine

186
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:48,589
and they're trying to access to a set of

187
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:50,480
data so what what are zero trust model

188
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,390
is going to do is look at things like

189
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,149
what is the workload that they're trying

190
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:58,550
to access are they using exchange are

191
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,920
they using SharePoint are they using

192
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,959
teams are they connecting to G suite are

193
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,089
they using Salesforce

194
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,680
what is the workload that they're trying

195
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:10,070
to get to are they allowed to use that

196
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,510
workload at all and and if so what

197
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,270
permissions do they have on that

198
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,490
workload then we look at the person

199
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:20,930
themselves in other words their their

200
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:24,620
identity is their is the identity that

201
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,449
they're using one that has potentially

202
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:30,490
been compromised are they logging in

203
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:34,550
from a location that is considered to be

204
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,500
untrustworthy are they logging in using

205
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,290
a pattern that doesn't match their

206
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,779
typical login pattern a time of day or a

207
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:45,230
physical location that doesn't look

208
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:48,350
right what is the device that they're

209
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:52,820
connecting from if most of the time I

210
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:55,310
log in using my Windows surface book and

211
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,300
then all of a sudden they see me trying

212
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:01,400
to log in using a MacBook you know

213
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,029
that's that's out of character for me

214
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,110
and it's going to raise the risk factor

215
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:09,410
doesn't mean they're necessarily going

216
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:13,459
to block me but it is going to raise

217
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:17,540
questions about whether I am who I say I

218
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:20,660
am now if all these factors start to

219
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,520
raise risks then we get to the point of

220
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,050
saying okay let's look at the

221
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:28,760
elegance around this what's what's going

222
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:31,040
on with all these anomalies you know

223
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,260
each each one individually might not be

224
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,060
such a red flag but if you put all three

225
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,860
of them together and you put it together

226
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,550
with you know what is it they're trying

227
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:43,400
to do is David trying to access the HR

228
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:46,849
system which never tries to connect you

229
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,980
on a normal basis is that something that

230
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,710
we want to allow that's the concept

231
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,800
behind zero trust is putting all these

232
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:58,640
pieces together and and starting to make

233
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,680
decisions and and forcing users to prove

234
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,830
who they say they are and prove that

235
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:08,630
they are reliable this is true even

236
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:11,870
within Microsoft depending on on what

237
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,490
workload you're trying to access you may

238
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,710
even be prompted for multi-factor

239
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,730
authentication inside Microsoft's

240
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:21,320
corporate network so it isn't just

241
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,510
considered zero trust outside the

242
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,970
corporate network it's zero Trustee

243
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:30,680
inside the corporate network and that's

244
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:33,860
an element of or a factor of the assumed

245
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,439
breach mentality that Microsoft has we

246
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,550
assume that there has been a breach

247
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,050
inside the network and that there is a

248
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,780
malicious actor inside the network and

249
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:47,959
so nobody can be trusted no network can

250
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:50,199
be trusted implicitly you still have to

251
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,390
prove who you are

252
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,280
now a lot of you have seen the attack

253
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,500
kill chain and so I'm gonna just build

254
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,810
this out real quickly but what I want to

255
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:05,150
do is kind of walk through some of the

256
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:08,530
steps here and discuss how Microsoft

257
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:12,079
tools can help you to protect your data

258
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:14,270
against different phases of the kill

259
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,410
chain now we know that it only takes

260
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:21,770
about 24 to 48 hours for a threat actor

261
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:24,079
to get access to domain admin privileges

262
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:25,790
after a successful phishing attack and

263
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,980
that's usually where we see these types

264
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,939
of attacks taking place first whether

265
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:35,570
it's a URL that drops some sort of

266
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,430
malware onto a victim's machine and then

267
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,950
they're able to exploit the Machine and

268
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:43,699
get command and control or if they're

269
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:45,740
able to you know open attachment which

270
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,560
does the same thing exploits the machine

271
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,570
or maybe they can steal credentials

272
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,189
through a password spray attack a brute

273
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:56,180
force password attack whatever it might

274
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:58,550
be in some way way shape or form they

275
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,410
get control either to a machine and then

276
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:06,130
credentials or they can get access to

277
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:11,180
credentials through a some other method

278
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:13,850
now we try to cover every single phase

279
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:18,589
of the attack kill chain so if you have

280
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:21,860
office 365 or Microsoft 365 is now

281
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:24,470
called there is office ATP advanced

282
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:29,300
threat protection for email which can

283
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:31,880
protect against malicious links in an

284
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,939
email malicious attachments we have

285
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:38,000
different tools that can prevent the

286
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,310
compromised of user accounts use of

287
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,600
stolen credentials I'll show you these

288
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:47,420
tools as we go through the demos once a

289
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,460
user account has been compromised then

290
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,189
the attacker is typically going to do a

291
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,170
couple things if they've compromised

292
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,000
just a standard user account they're

293
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,089
gonna try to move laterally on the

294
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,620
machines in the network and try to find

295
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,380
a machine that gives them credentials

296
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:06,380
that are useful to them whether it's

297
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:09,200
to some simple database with HR data or

298
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,510
credit card data or if it gets them to

299
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,490
domain admin privileges they're able to

300
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,860
elevate the privileges to the to the

301
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,080
level that they need to get the stuff

302
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,530
that they want and really the important

303
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:24,860
thing to remember here is that getting

304
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:27,110
domain admin is not the end goal right

305
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,180
the the the the end goal is to get

306
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,820
enough privileges to get the data that

307
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:37,150
they want domain admin typically does

308
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:40,370
that but if they just need access to a

309
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:42,500
file that has credit card numbers that's

310
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,030
all the privileges they need they don't

311
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,700
necessarily need the main admin they

312
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:50,180
just need enough privileges to do what

313
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:52,640
they want to do so while they're going

314
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,250
through this process of compromising

315
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,340
accounts they start looking around and

316
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:02,210
figuring out where the data is that they

317
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:04,700
can most effectively use and so here's

318
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,560
where things like a surety privileged

319
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:10,220
Identity Management making sure that

320
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,880
those privileged accounts are only used

321
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:16,910
for the the time period that they're

322
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:20,240
needed there's no standing privileged

323
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,040
account access in other words a person

324
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,740
doesn't have standing domain admin

325
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,439
privileges or standing exchange admin

326
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,030
privileges they request those privileges

327
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,100
are granted those privileges for a

328
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:34,030
period of time and then those privileges

329
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:37,880
are revoked so that even if an attacker

330
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:41,420
is able to get on that users machine

331
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:45,770
those privileges no longer exist

332
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,990
and they can't be utilized once they

333
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,030
establish domain presence and

334
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,770
persistence you know things are kind of

335
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,530
bad at that point but but one of the

336
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:57,199
things that that we often see is that

337
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:58,459
once the attacker gets access to the

338
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,620
data that they want they start

339
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,590
exfiltrating it through one form or

340
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,540
another and so we have the tool called

341
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,569
Microsoft cloud app security that allows

342
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:12,950
you to protect different workloads even

343
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:15,349
non-microsoft workloads from being from

344
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,370
the data being exfiltrated to other

345
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:19,109
locations

346
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:21,989
so let's take a look at the different

347
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:25,369
ways that we secure this so the the

348
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:28,980
third way really is the identity

349
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:32,879
protecting the identity so identity is

350
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,980
really the core of the zero trust

351
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,640
methodology if you can't protect the

352
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:41,070
identities of the users then really the

353
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,800
game is over it before it's even started

354
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,889
and so that's why Microsoft is looking

355
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:51,450
at Azure Active Directory as being the

356
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:54,720
core security element of not just

357
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,840
Microsoft products but of thousands of

358
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,810
other applications that can leverage

359
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,830
Azure ad for its authentication and so

360
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:08,070
we build really really powerful security

361
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,830
controls into Azure ad to make sure that

362
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,689
those identities are protected to the

363
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,480
greatest extent possible if you're using

364
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:19,350
Azure ad to authenticate to your CRM

365
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:22,350
system to Salesforce to box or Dropbox

366
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,780
or Google suite or Amazon or whatever it

367
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:29,370
is you have to make sure that that

368
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:33,030
identity is protected very well the next

369
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:35,159
concept is assume every resources on the

370
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:38,790
open end internet in other words this is

371
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:43,560
the assumed breach thought process so

372
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:46,080
again if we see a user logging into a

373
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,629
machine whether it's a laptop a mobile

374
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,879
device or a standard desktop we're

375
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,580
looking at intent right this is not

376
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,180
meant to dispel internet we're looking

377
00:18:53,580 --> 00:19:01,340
at their intent and and we derive that

378
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:04,020
intent from this set of scoring criteria

379
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,470
what is their identity what is the

380
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,690
device that they're try to connect from

381
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:11,880
what is the location what's the workload

382
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,500
they're trying to get to and pulling all

383
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,470
that data together we come up with a

384
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:20,790
risk score that helps us to determine

385
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:24,560
whether this person trying to use this

386
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:27,800
device to access this workload is a

387
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,800
valid combination

388
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:36,860
and so we're left with this concept

389
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:40,850
again of never trust always verify and

390
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:43,740
so that brings us back to trust no one

391
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,929
right that's what the concept of zero

392
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,600
trust means now what I'm going to do

393
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:50,670
here is drop out of the PowerPoint

394
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,449
presentation and we're going to go

395
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:59,010
through several of tools that Microsoft

396
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:03,380
has available in the entry 65 suite that

397
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:07,050
you can use to secure your environment

398
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:09,300
so what I've done here is I've kind of

399
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:12,300
pre staged some of my my tabs just so

400
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,800
things are quicker and move about mm-hmm

401
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,330
but once you get into Azure Active

402
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,330
Directory one of the first things that

403
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,429
you can do is leverage identity secure

404
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,100
score now many of you are probably

405
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:26,130
familiar with Microsoft secure score or

406
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:29,840
maybe office 365 secures for this

407
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:32,760
methodology of scoring is becoming

408
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,250
common across most of the the workloads

409
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,850
in the cloud for Microsoft and and a lot

410
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:41,480
of vendors are also following the same

411
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:44,370
methodology the idea is that there is a

412
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:47,730
value that you potentially could get to

413
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:50,280
in this case it's 203 and then the

414
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,440
controls that I have implemented add up

415
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:56,250
to 93 so I'm a little bit less than

416
00:20:52,440 --> 00:21:00,020
halfway to where I should be as far as

417
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:04,320
securing the identities in Azure ad if

418
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:07,470
you notice here this is my tenant this

419
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,470
shows that my score is 93 compared to

420
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:12,680
the industry average for the industry

421
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,680
that I've identified this tenant to be

422
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:21,630
I'm doing better right so so they

423
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:23,220
typically are about 43 they so so 93 is

424
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,550
is much better than the industry average

425
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:31,170
and then for your typical 0 to 5 person

426
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:34,050
company 16 so significantly better than

427
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:36,929
that now what does identity secure score

428
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:39,270
give me first of all it shows me my

429
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:42,290
score for the last however many days

430
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:43,760
right so the last week last 30 days

431
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,190
because there's not much change going on

432
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,980
this is what you see I don't think in

433
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,510
the last 90 days much has really changed

434
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,390
well we'll see what actually looks yeah

435
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,530
so so it's been pretty steady the whole

436
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,570
last three months I haven't made any

437
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,760
significant changes to my environment in

438
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:02,270
the last three months but what this

439
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:05,120
tells me down here what are the actions

440
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:08,180
I could perform in my environment to

441
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,820
improve the security level of my

442
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,640
identities and it shows me what the

443
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:16,010
impact would be of each of the of these

444
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,250
actions so for example if I forced all

445
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:22,070
my admins to use MFA when they log in

446
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,880
that would increase my score by 25

447
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:28,270
points so I bump it up from 93 to

448
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,430
whatever that is 118 something like that

449
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,139
it tells me also that the user impact is

450
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,180
going to be low and if the

451
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:39,440
implementation cost is low so let's take

452
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:43,850
a look at this I click on the the bar it

453
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,500
tells me about the information or about

454
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:48,139
about the the implementation the

455
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,140
improvement what the score impact is

456
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:55,640
going to be it gives me a description of

457
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,900
the requested action how is it that

458
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,810
you're going to change it what is you

459
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,570
actually have to change how is it going

460
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:04,429
to affect your users and and how long it

461
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,710
will take for this secure score update

462
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:10,280
to be reflected in your secure score I

463
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:14,390
can go in here and say my status of this

464
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:16,700
is I'm already doing MFA with you know I

465
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:19,850
might be doing RSA right so I can say

466
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,680
third party or I can say ignore I don't

467
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,280
really care about that it doesn't mean

468
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,350
that that it's going to drop out of my

469
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:30,379
list of recommendations it's just not

470
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:33,620
high on the the priority list for right

471
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:37,130
now so the more I go through this list

472
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:41,600
and and implement these controls the

473
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:44,050
better my security score becomes and we

474
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:49,790
have these secure scores for Azure or

475
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:52,220
sequel for Microsoft 365 for endpoint

476
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:55,980
security and and they're really all

477
00:23:52,220 --> 00:24:01,020
rolling up into Microsoft secure

478
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:03,750
or which is shown here so here I went to

479
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:07,139
the security admin Center or the admin

480
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:09,570
portal security Microsoft comm and this

481
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,120
is this is showing an all up Microsoft

482
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:15,270
secure score so I've got the element of

483
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:19,889
identity here how am i protecting the

484
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:21,929
data in my office 365 tenant how am i

485
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,169
protecting my devices not very well in

486
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:27,690
this case the applications and then even

487
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:29,130
the infrastructure in Azure so it's

488
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,270
pulling all the data from those

489
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:36,809
properties together into a comprehensive

490
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:38,070
score and and the idea is that we don't

491
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:42,149
want you to have to look at so many

492
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:44,730
different portals in order to understand

493
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:47,309
what your security posture is but if I

494
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:49,799
go over here and and start looking at

495
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:51,440
the improvement actions here there's

496
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:54,780
also a tab here that gives me more

497
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,490
information mm-hmm you'll see that the

498
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,389
data is being pulled from different

499
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:00,360
locations

500
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:03,750
so if I go to the product or the

501
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,928
category I can see that the category for

502
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:11,000
a lot of these things is identity but as

503
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:16,940
I scroll down if I filter actually I can

504
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,940
look at all the different types of

505
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,750
categories

506
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:24,870
right and so some of them are related to

507
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,500
device security improvements some to

508
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:32,989
identity some to applications and and on

509
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:35,640
and on so I can maybe assign different

510
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,950
tasks to different groups of people in

511
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,860
my organization so I may have an

512
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:45,890
identity group that manages identity is

513
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,889
exclusively so I can click on this and

514
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:53,820
and this gives me a little bit more

515
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,219
detail that I can work with so I can say

516
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,550
that the the action plan for

517
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:01,920
implementing user risk policy is planned

518
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:05,129
or I've accepted that risk or I resolved

519
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:09,360
it through some other method so this

520
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:12,990
allows me to to make a lot of more

521
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:17,790
granular and specific things available

522
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:19,020
to my security organization so one of

523
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:22,770
the things I clicked on there was the

524
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:24,750
user risk policy so if we take a look at

525
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,940
the user risk policy what this is doing

526
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,100
once you turn it on and start enforcing

527
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,470
it is it takes a look at the users and

528
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,500
you can specify which users I've just

529
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:37,860
decided decided to look at all users in

530
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:41,429
this case mm-hmm but it says what is the

531
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:44,520
user risk so Microsoft as I described

532
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:47,640
before assigns a level of user risk

533
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,760
based on a variety of factors now we are

534
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,300
able to see billions of authentications

535
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:57,420
every month against many many properties

536
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:00,419
that we manage you know as you're an

537
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:04,200
office 365 and Xbox and hotmail and

538
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:07,890
whatever so so we understand what what

539
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:11,730
is it anomaly and and what is a normal

540
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:14,780
login for any given user really and so

541
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:17,850
if we see the user risk level rise

542
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,260
medium or above maybe we want to take an

543
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:24,959
action on that I'm gonna leave it at

544
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:28,710
high right and if I go here what I'm

545
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,220
saying is if any user hits a user risk

546
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:36,710
level of high then what I'm gonna

547
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:40,880
ask is that this shows up I'm going to

548
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:42,950
ask that the user be forced to change

549
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,090
their password it's just taking a minute

550
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:49,789
to pull up so I can force them to change

551
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:52,250
their password or I can just block

552
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:53,990
access altogether I can say if their

553
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:56,539
user risk level is high just block

554
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,610
access and then the user calls it

555
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:02,330
helpdesk you verified who they are and

556
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:04,610
you restore their access but maybe I

557
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:09,830
just want to force a password change on

558
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:12,020
them now so that's the user risk policy

559
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:13,760
turn this on for different groups

560
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:17,000
different people might have different

561
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:21,590
policy making policies applied to them

562
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,720
so maybe either the the c-level

563
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:26,178
executives have one level of policy

564
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,980
applied to them the finance people have

565
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:29,600
another policy applied to them the IT

566
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,669
people have a different policy apply to

567
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:37,399
them you can do that however you want

568
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:38,900
mm-hmm if I go back here and one of the

569
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,000
things I'm going to look at is is take

570
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:45,200
this concept of a Dre the identity

571
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:49,880
protection look at the risky users so I

572
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:54,169
mentioned the idea of how we categorize

573
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:57,470
risk so I've got a bunch of users here

574
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:59,990
that have had some sort of risk level

575
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:02,360
assigned to them some of them have lo

576
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,730
some of them have high and some of the

577
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,490
risks have been remediated for for

578
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,320
whatever reason they were you know

579
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,830
discounted as being not really a risk

580
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,710
false positive or maybe we were able to

581
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:18,678
fix the problem but let's go in here and

582
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:23,799
take a look at Alan to young because his

583
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:28,610
risk level is high if I click on him and

584
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:30,110
ice hold this oops David just to let you

585
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:32,360
know we just got a few minutes left

586
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:38,510
he'll be wrapping up ok oh ok

587
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:40,908
Wow sorry yeah yeah that's fine so if I

588
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:44,149
scroll down here I see some basic

589
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:44,930
information about Alan's account I see

590
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,540
that

591
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,430
he's at risk he's at high and then I

592
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:53,120
want to find out what exactly caused

593
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:55,430
that risk so I go to risk history see if

594
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:00,219
I can scroll this up a little bit it's

595
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:03,080
not letting me write so the risk history

596
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:06,560
it shows me that at 7 o'clock in the

597
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,659
morning on February 16th his account

598
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,480
logged in from a malicious IP address so

599
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,730
maybe this is my net maybe this is you

600
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,740
know you won't logged in from a node on

601
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:20,270
the Tor network whatever it is that's

602
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:23,840
what caused his address or his ID to be

603
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:25,820
labeled as risky so I can go in and I

604
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,580
can say I confirm that he's been

605
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:31,129
compromised I can dismiss it I can block

606
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,750
him I can force a password reset there's

607
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:36,500
a lot of different options I've got

608
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,050
available to me let's see what else I

609
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:41,330
can show in just another minute

610
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:43,960
conditional access so conditional access

611
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,939
we can set up policies that require

612
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,760
users to perform a different level of

613
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,770
authentication depending on the workload

614
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,840
that they're accessing so for example

615
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:57,830
what I've done here is set up a session

616
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:01,639
control for teams so what this is saying

617
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:06,020
is that for all my users who are

618
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:07,100
accessing teams I can apply conditions

619
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:11,180
don't you know depending of what the

620
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:13,760
sign-in risk is what device platform

621
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:16,180
they're logging in with and different

622
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,760
locations that they're logging in from

623
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:23,210
if they meet this set of criteria then I

624
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,930
will grant them access but maybe I

625
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:29,360
require a multi-factor authentication or

626
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:33,170
maybe I require them to accept the Terms

627
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:37,270
of Use okay so so what actually happens

628
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:39,800
in this case is I'm going to enforce

629
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,470
conditional access application control

630
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,970
when they try to access teams through

631
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,650
the browser so let me show you what that

632
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:49,610
looks like

633
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:52,060
so I log in and I try to go to teams in

634
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,060
the browser

635
00:31:52,470 --> 00:32:00,560
and you'll see me get prompted

636
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:05,150
right so it tells me that my access to

637
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:07,520
teams is being monitored and I just need

638
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:10,160
to verify that that's what I want to do

639
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,320
so I didn't require multi-factor

640
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:15,320
authentication in this play in this case

641
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,659
I'm just notifying people that the

642
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,540
access is being monitored and they can

643
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:23,270
get into teams I didn't have time to

644
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,700
show you cloud app security the cloud

645
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:29,060
app security is one of the most powerful

646
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:31,850
tools that we have for maintaining the

647
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:37,070
security of your data in a variety of

648
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:38,740
locations so for example I'm able to see

649
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:42,230
the different types of data that are

650
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:44,080
that's being accessed not just in

651
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:46,760
Microsoft workloads

652
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,540
everything just got reset here let me

653
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,600
fix this

654
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,600
you

655
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,780
so I'm able to see the stuff that's that

656
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,060
my users are connecting to these

657
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,129
different workloads in my network so

658
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,780
they're getting not just the office

659
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,220
stuff but they're going to Amazon

660
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,750
they're going to Google they're going to

661
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,660
and a plan

662
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:10,700
ESPN dolly drive and I can make

663
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:15,650
decisions about whether I sanction that

664
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:17,660
or market is unsanctioned then one of

665
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:21,050
the things I can do here is connect

666
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:23,630
different applications to cloud app

667
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:26,840
security so in this case I've got the

668
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:30,890
ability to connect my Salesforce my AWS

669
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:33,470
instance G suite Dropbox Azure and this

670
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:35,480
way I'm monitoring the access and able

671
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,420
to audit the access to all these

672
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,870
properties and several others that are

673
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:45,110
listed here so you can monitor when

674
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:46,639
users are connecting to their AWS

675
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,500
machines what are they doing are they

676
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,200
shutting down machines or they deleting

677
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:56,540
machines you're able to track that

678
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,850
auditing with cloud trail so apologizin

679
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:03,950
get to show you all the stuff that was

680
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:07,219
in my my plan there we ran out of time

681
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,690
but again the the key that we want to

682
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,780
make sure that everybody remembers is

683
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:15,200
that protecting your data requires you

684
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:18,409
to protect your identities and so where

685
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,219
that leads us with is you'd have to

686
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:21,669
trust no one

687
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:24,859
so thank you for your time I appreciate

688
