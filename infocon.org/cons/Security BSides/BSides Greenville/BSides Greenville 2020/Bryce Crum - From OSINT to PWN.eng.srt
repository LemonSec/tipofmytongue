1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:09,940
my name is Bryce Crum I am an associate

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,110
penetration tester with the Verdean and

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,850
the topic today that I'm gonna be

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,129
talking about is from Moo sent to pone

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:16,570
and the primary topic of this is gonna

6
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:18,279
be centric around kind of a different

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,470
viewpoint from what most people

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:22,780
experience when discussing open source

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,160
intelligence so with open source

10
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,010
intelligence you're typically getting a

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,110
forensics viewpoint or some form of kind

12
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,930
of investigative viewpoint I would say

13
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:34,180
and for this purpose this talk is going

14
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,010
to talk about how an attacker or in this

15
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,229
case a penetration tester or red teamer

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:41,399
can utilize that same information to

17
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:43,839
kind of enumerate and have access to

18
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,749
situations and services we may not have

19
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:48,460
identified or been able to breach

20
00:00:45,749 --> 00:00:50,139
previously so that's kind of the the

21
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,219
overview very quickly for the the

22
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:55,989
presentation as just kind of quick

23
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:58,659
introductions as I said I thought it was

24
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,458
a Veridian I have held many different

25
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:02,498
roles in the past I've been a c-sharp

26
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:04,750
developer I've been working through

27
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:06,790
business systems analysis went into

28
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,430
security operation center for a time I

29
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,590
worked as a red team member for quite

30
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:15,790
some time and then moved into my current

31
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:18,040
role I personally kind of describe

32
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,930
myself as a perpetual newb I'm always

33
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,000
trying to understand and learn new

34
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,010
things but I always find myself even

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,810
when I get the grasp on the the smallest

36
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,700
thing I believe oh now I've got you know

37
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,310
some general understanding I realize how

38
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,780
massive that web truly is and it's it's

39
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,000
the impossibility for me to have

40
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,170
understood it at that level so it's it's

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,330
one of the amazing things about our

42
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,980
industry you oh but you think you've

43
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,330
understood everything about a room only

44
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,740
just turn your head and realize you were

45
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:47,679
standing in the far corner so really an

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,630
enthusiastic viewpoint there the I am

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,650
also an ETSU alumni as well as an

48
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,600
offensive security certified

49
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,909
professional I have a wonderful wife who

50
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,080
deals with me putting presentations

51
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:58,690
together and kicking her out of the

52
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,150
house to give presentations I'm also a

53
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,800
hobby jumper which basically is a

54
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,810
terminology I didn't know existed but

55
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,729
fits very well which means that I jump

56
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,310
from hobby to hobby depending on the day

57
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:10,899
as well as depending what I'm feeling he

58
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,989
recently was rock climbing but with

59
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,569
kovat we all know how that goes and then

60
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,170
the primary thing that you'll notice

61
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,730
throughout these slides is I mean

62
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,769
and I have quite a few of them

63
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,720
throughout so if you're not interested

64
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,599
in memes I apologize in advance but

65
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,670
you'll see quite a few a quick

66
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,019
disclaimer though all the views that I

67
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,519
expressed during this presentation are

68
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,709
my own and don't necessarily represent

69
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,450
the opinions of my employer or any

70
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:38,150
entity who I'm currently or Prest

71
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:41,929
associated with it's just you know very

72
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:44,569
generic standard disclaimer so diving

73
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,760
right in as I go through each of these

74
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:49,130
to kind of give you some more insights I

75
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,440
never tried to present attack

76
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,819
methodologies or any form of offensive

77
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,069
standards without giving some form of a

78
00:02:54,819 --> 00:03:01,429
background around defense tactics as

79
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:03,350
well so each category as we go through I

80
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,700
will give an overview of the knowledge

81
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,930
that you're going to be looking for the

82
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,359
insight that you're trying to gain from

83
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,250
that category then we'll move into the

84
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,530
attacks that we typically perform with

85
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,420
that knowledge after accumulating it and

86
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,459
then some defenses that can be performed

87
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,200
to prevent me from being able to get

88
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,769
that information or to slow me down at

89
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,600
the worst so that'll kind of all come

90
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,459
into play after the introduction the

91
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,530
other side of that through this overview

92
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,239
each of these categories are going to

93
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,160
build on one another they're put in this

94
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,430
order for a reason

95
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,840
so typically this is my methodology

96
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,670
obviously there are many others who may

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,400
have much better methodology but this is

98
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,410
the one I prefer to use and from that

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,790
it's kind of ever-expanding but the

100
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,290
general way that I progress is I'll

101
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,929
follow through from general information

102
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,340
users and email addresses you know kind

103
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,600
of hunt down a little bit into passwords

104
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,609
and secrets and then the numeration

105
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,340
system information and source code where

106
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:56,900
available so that's kind of you'll

107
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,640
you'll hear me refer back to previous

108
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,989
categories as I progressed through just

109
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,069
know that these kind of build on one

110
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:06,620
another so I guess to start off what is

111
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,089
open source intelligence well from the

112
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,010
viewpoints that I've seen most people

113
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,480
discuss in kind of the the other ways

114
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,010
that I've seen it described it's

115
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,679
basically data that can be obtained

116
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,149
publicly from multiple sources any

117
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,918
source that doesn't require some form of

118
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,769
authentication or is bound in some way

119
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,840
to be then used to process and make a

120
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:27,349
decision and typically to make an

121
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,940
informed decision if possible so a lot

122
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:30,620
of times when people discuss open source

123
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,680
intelligence you'll hear social media

124
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,920
you'll hear

125
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,950
around information around blog posts or

126
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,240
the very generic well-known sources but

127
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,729
the other things to consider our

128
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,940
repositories DNS information academic

129
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,150
papers court information as well as the

130
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,610
the common other ones blogs videos

131
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:53,130
articles so on and so forth so there's a

132
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,460
lot of data that accumulates into open

133
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,440
source intelligence and with it kind of

134
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,549
comes various definitions depending on

135
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,410
the environment you're in

136
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,420
once again this is from an attackers

137
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,520
perspective so we'll be covering a bit

138
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,260
more around the obscure as well as that

139
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,240
tends to be where we're gonna find more

140
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:14,570
interesting information so starting off

141
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,400
with general information

142
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:19,500
we're not typically begin these types of

143
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,260
these OSINT investigations as they were

144
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,020
from an attackers perspective it really

145
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,659
depends on what environment were what

146
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,830
engagement I'm going to be dealing with

147
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,230
obviously if I'm dealing with an

148
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,909
external penetration test versus a web

149
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,440
application assessment those are two

150
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,850
completely different spheres and I'm

151
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,540
gonna be targeting completely different

152
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,760
information depending so obviously it's

153
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,710
kind of the start game with what do you

154
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,750
know or what has already been

155
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,310
provisioned to you when you're starting

156
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:52,320
off in dealing with very specific

157
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,360
engagements where a client or someone

158
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,950
has came in and given very detailed

159
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,450
information about what they want to cest

160
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:02,820
it then changes the way that these types

161
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,490
of information gathering and building

162
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,219
and utilizing that kind of passive recon

163
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:11,490
if you will being able to take that

164
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,770
information in and use it is is changed

165
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,210
quite a bit because the more specific

166
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,460
for the engagement details the more

167
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,039
specific the open source intelligent has

168
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:24,599
to be intelligence has to be to match it

169
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,919
so obviously if a would say someone has

170
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,290
come in and decided that they want an

171
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,060
assessment done that they've said you

172
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,780
have free rein basically here's the name

173
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,540
of the company

174
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,489
go figure information out then give us

175
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,650
the option to decide whether or not it's

176
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,410
in scope but we just want to see what's

177
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,750
there right that office obviously is a

178
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,710
very broad scope you're you're in a

179
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,689
situation where you're going to be doing

180
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,779
a lot more open source intelligence on

181
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:50,159
more aspects in a lot more areas whereas

182
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:52,409
if someone comes in and says these are

183
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,058
the exact hosts I want checked these are

184
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:57,058
the exact services on those hosts I want

185
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:59,189
checked I want you know XYZ done that

186
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:01,289
then very you know that there is down

187
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:02,579
the amount of research that you're going

188
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:05,639
to be doing and what you're currently

189
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:07,139
targeting so the biggest hint there is

190
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,119
to read the information because that

191
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,439
information is going to not only narrow

192
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:12,719
the scope down as what you're going to

193
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:15,719
be doing but also gives you the the

194
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:18,119
benefit of understanding some other

195
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:19,979
intricacies around what you're going to

196
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:22,489
be doing with this assessment and the

197
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,568
network that people are dealing with so

198
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:26,698
general information what you're going to

199
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,860
be going after depends on what you

200
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,979
started with but realistically the

201
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,129
things that I always try to grab names

202
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:38,339
anything as far as aliases go around

203
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:39,959
someone addresses phone numbers for the

204
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,550
company especially around company

205
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,919
directories or front desk things of that

206
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,839
nature email addresses if you can find

207
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,549
them right off this gets we get a lot

208
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,079
more into that later but this is kind of

209
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:52,649
the generic if you will first page of

210
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:55,079
Google moment right websites their

211
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:57,389
domains possibly that are just

212
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,279
immediately apparent through SEO images

213
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:01,800
videos so on so forth just grabbing the

214
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,229
quick things what I will say is on

215
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,149
images and videos I tend to leave those

216
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:07,849
out until much later on as I'm

217
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:11,489
progressing through simply because it's

218
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:14,009
kind of a a time sink and obviously with

219
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:16,018
these types of engagements as well as in

220
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:18,269
in the real world a real world attacker

221
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:19,889
doesn't necessarily have an infinite

222
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:22,619
amount of time although we we'd like to

223
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,569
talk about that from time to time unless

224
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:25,889
they're extremely dedicated more often

225
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,079
than not an attacker is going to be

226
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,519
trying to gather information on a large

227
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,719
number of targets right and they only

228
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,339
have a set amount of time they're

229
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,870
willing to spend and it's kind of the

230
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,240
same idea from a penetration test

231
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:41,188
perspective unless they're it's a very

232
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,019
targeted situation obviously so how do

233
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:45,540
we attack general information right

234
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,399
obviously okay we've pulled names of

235
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,930
locations and we've seen some pictures

236
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,129
of the buildings they have what are we

237
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,069
doing with this information

238
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:54,750
well this tends to be the foundation

239
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:58,170
that all the rest will be laid upon

240
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,040
right this will give you the more that

241
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,259
you

242
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,009
gather and generate and pull together

243
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:06,540
for this type of baseline will give you

244
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:10,019
basically the structure you'll build the

245
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:12,209
rest of your attacks on so anytime that

246
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:16,589
you run into information even if you may

247
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:18,359
find it very tedious if you will it may

248
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,949
be valuable make a quick note of where

249
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,149
you found it even if it's something that

250
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:23,490
doesn't get used

251
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:25,680
you have source notes for it you can go

252
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,690
back and find it some of the ways that I

253
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,329
typically will immediately jump into

254
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,459
password list generation you know if

255
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:34,229
you've got a information already that

256
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:36,689
you've built up around individuals at

257
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,889
the company products they've they sell

258
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,750
things of that nature the things that

259
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:41,759
you can pick up fairly quickly on like I

260
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,759
said a front page of a search engine

261
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:48,959
alright take that information dump it

262
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:50,490
into the tools like crunch cups crew or

263
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,319
cool is also a really good tool if

264
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,410
you're gonna be doing web scraping it's

265
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:56,910
a good tool for targeting a company's

266
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,730
website and generating password lists

267
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,439
off of it obviously password lists come

268
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,449
into play in multiple attacks but

269
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,660
realistically it doesn't by its own

270
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:07,740
nature give a direct attack so more

271
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,420
often than not you're not going to beep

272
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,730
owning from general information right

273
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,139
and don't forget about two users or

274
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,550
don't forget about rules so especially

275
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:16,079
if you're dealing with an internal

276
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,819
situation where you're gonna be doing

277
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,709
internal engagements and you've captured

278
00:10:17,819 --> 00:10:21,209
hashes now you've turned back to that

279
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,589
password list you generated during the

280
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,109
information or general information

281
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:27,389
session use rules to go ahead and and

282
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,690
get the most out of that password list

283
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:32,970
because very minor changes such as a

284
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,699
zero instead of an O or a dollar sign

285
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,470
instead of an S the standard

286
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:39,180
modifications that people make are the

287
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,139
types of things that tend to throw off

288
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,989
standard password cracks right from

289
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,279
social engineering standpoint the more

290
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,079
general information you can gather the

291
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,730
more credibility you have I've actually

292
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:52,949
found myself in some of my own

293
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,630
situations where I've needed to social

294
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:57,089
engineer my way out of sticky situations

295
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,040
or I've been in a situation where I need

296
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:01,589
to discuss with an individual to get

297
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,139
access to an area and just knowing basic

298
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:06,630
information that a corporation would

299
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:08,579
expect an employee to know gives you a

300
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,620
level of credibility beyond the general

301
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,989
populace and sometimes that's enough to

302
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,360
convince them to allow you to then can

303
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,640
in you on obviously it depends on the

304
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,810
context and obviously you know the the

305
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,029
information that you're gonna be using

306
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,560
is gonna vary depending on who you're

307
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:26,910
discussing with or what you're targeting

308
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,099
but by and large the just very generic

309
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,140
information such as building number or a

310
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,940
store location or store number or

311
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,399
whatever information else you can pull

312
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,110
can give you a lot of credibility when

313
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,149
dealing with a persona that you've put

314
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,240
together for social engineering as well

315
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:44,880
as for phishing campaigns physical

316
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,470
security comes into its own here general

317
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,939
information is typically going to be the

318
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,000
biggest data dump that you can get

319
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,589
around physical if you're going to be

320
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,630
targeting from a physical perspective

321
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:56,700
you can get a fairly strong

322
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,380
understanding of the electronic security

323
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,200
controls that are in place you can get a

324
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,910
strong understanding of kind of the the

325
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,850
physical security as far as locks

326
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,050
possibly door handle styles right maybe

327
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,490
if you're gonna be deploying stuff like

328
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,229
an under door tool or things of that

329
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,570
nature you may be able to pull

330
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,520
information such as camera locations and

331
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,620
the parking arrangement understanding

332
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,360
where to park and where to move and see

333
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,190
the flow of where individuals tend to

334
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,500
stand and move within the location is

335
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,300
extremely valuable anytime that you can

336
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,250
get that information definitely go after

337
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,260
it obviously Google Maps typically strip

338
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,450
or strips out cars from parking lots

339
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,550
things of that nature but you can

340
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,160
typically see it inside of corporate

341
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,449
locations where they've added images to

342
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,130
their website or things of that nature

343
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,860
especially if they have buildings that

344
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,870
they're they're particularly proud of

345
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,730
that can be a lot of great insight into

346
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,190
understanding the normal business

347
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:50,399
operations and flow to give you a lot of

348
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:53,279
credibility also kind of plays into the

349
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,589
same dress code that way you don't have

350
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,029
to do as much active reconnaissance you

351
00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:00,779
don't have to risk yourself being there

352
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:02,399
in inappropriate attire necessarily you

353
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,810
know if you are going to be targeting a

354
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,370
location and you're assuming their

355
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,540
business professional you show up in a

356
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,610
suit and tie and you watch and

357
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,219
everyone's walking in with khakis and a

358
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,660
polo on then you put yourself in a

359
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,720
situation where you're highly likely to

360
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,890
be detected while doing recon right even

361
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,930
if you're just sitting in your car you

362
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,819
can still be noticed and so it's kind of

363
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,410
that situation of you're eliminating

364
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,720
that aspect if you can gather that

365
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,310
information here and then the biggest

366
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,959
one of course is the doors and windows

367
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,569
that's your ingress and egress points

368
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,579
that's gonna be how you get in get out

369
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:34,620
whatever you can do and also

370
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,300
understanding the the door controls

371
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,300
right can you tailgate is there

372
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,498
situation where the door isn't is not a

373
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,540
turn stall or something of that nature

374
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:44,399
you can just follow someone in or is it

375
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,469
a turn stall situation where you're

376
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,300
gonna need electronic controls to get

377
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,620
into the building is there gates what

378
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,969
kind of other security controls are

379
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,370
you're gonna have to bypass to even get

380
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,350
in so security kind of comes in or

381
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,610
physical security kind of comes into its

382
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:02,459
own during general information gathering

383
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:04,759
so how do we defend with people

384
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:07,498
gathering general information well

385
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:10,199
typically defense side is going to come

386
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:12,360
in to a weird situation with general

387
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:14,878
information where it's almost going to

388
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:19,259
not be worth the the battle depending on

389
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:22,439
the populace you serve right so if you

390
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,870
have a client group that is the general

391
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:27,029
populace you can't risk closing down

392
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,230
information such as phone numbers or

393
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:31,050
email addresses or things of that nature

394
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,910
from search engines because you need

395
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,878
that for business it just makes logical

396
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:38,639
sense there but if you are someone who

397
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:41,100
is or if you are representing a company

398
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,589
that does not have you know a direct

399
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,850
need to share that information try to

400
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,339
get business listing information

401
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,620
unlisted right anytime that you can

402
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,269
unlist information that's more digging

403
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,639
than a tagger has to do can they still

404
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:55,170
get it most certainly are there a number

405
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,300
of tools out there that can get it most

406
00:14:55,170 --> 00:15:00,420
certainly but the more you unlist the

407
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,508
harder it is to find reduce web presence

408
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,329
so it's kind of the joke the counter

409
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:07,589
opposite of doing development in

410
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,628
development they talk a lot about

411
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:11,220
optimizing search engine optimization

412
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:12,839
right getting that down to where your

413
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,209
keyword searches are nailing every

414
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,069
single time if you're going to try to be

415
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:19,079
avoiding people finding even general

416
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:20,399
information about your company you don't

417
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,008
necessarily want search engine

418
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,389
optimization in place as well as

419
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:27,829
reducing the web presence as much as

420
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:30,209
possible we'll get into that more later

421
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:32,519
consider reducing the social media posts

422
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:34,050
you make obviously if you're at this

423
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,899
level you're probably not making many

424
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,240
social media posts but if you are make

425
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:40,230
sure that you are making you know the

426
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,790
most out of the post

427
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,180
you do use and that there is something

428
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,230
in the process that is making sure that

429
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,689
security is considered as you're

430
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:50,670
progressing through something that

431
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,290
allows for individuals that are making

432
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,870
these posts to have a second set of

433
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:57,569
highs that has the mindset of a security

434
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,120
professional and knowing that that

435
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,890
background image of the card reader at

436
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,230
our door may give away insight into

437
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,880
whether it's kind of your low frequency

438
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,750
high and 25 kilohertz or high frequency

439
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,860
card reader right and the cure can be

440
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,200
worse than the element here so

441
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,650
realistically many of these may not be

442
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,210
valid options for your company or the

443
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,390
the options that you used to defend your

444
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:23,790
company so keep that in mind you can't

445
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:25,470
be locking down the fortress when

446
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,630
there's other holes or if it's you know

447
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:31,560
you can't pull the drawbridge up if you

448
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:34,830
need the population to come in so so

449
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,989
moving on to users and emails this one's

450
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,030
kind of in three parts I typically break

451
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:41,460
it up the the target that I typically go

452
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:44,790
after first is to identify email

453
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:47,940
patterns this tends to be what I will

454
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:50,430
build the rest of the list on this tends

455
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,600
to be what user name as if any of you

456
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,239
were able to catch Michael Berardi

457
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,100
stalking passwords bring this to be

458
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,630
where I'm gonna build the the username

459
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,240
list that I'm gonna utilize for password

460
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:03,170
sprang out of all of it depends on me

461
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,510
identifying an email pattern typically

462
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:08,069
taking that email pattern and applying

463
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,770
the identified users which comes into

464
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,480
the next category that's generates the

465
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,060
list so how do you identify those email

466
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,490
patterns I typically like to use generic

467
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:19,649
tools obviously you can just go to a

468
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,420
search engine pull it up throw in an

469
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,370
email or throw in a domain name and see

470
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,770
if you can kind of enumerate through the

471
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:29,340
or metadata there to find an email

472
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:31,170
address if you can't and if you can't

473
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,939
make a informed decision off of even

474
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:34,740
five six there I like to use things such

475
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,640
as hundred I Oh which is kind of done

476
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,470
all of that for you

477
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,840
where they do the scraping you just go

478
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,840
in there punch in the domain and it will

479
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,010
spit out way believes is the pattern

480
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,810
obviously it's not gonna work for

481
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,030
companies that have multiple patterns if

482
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,740
they're using four or five six different

483
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:52,290
pattern styles depending on department

484
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,880
or depending on whatever that can all

485
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,549
come into play and make

486
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,020
much more difficult for an attacker the

487
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:00,780
harvester I've had some luck with it in

488
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,570
the past it hasn't really I haven't had

489
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,549
as much luck with it here as of late but

490
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,200
it definitely was pretty powerful in the

491
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:09,780
past and then recon ng has various

492
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,510
modules as well really powerful tool

493
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,730
great tool for various portions of open

494
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,039
source I don't myself tend to use it as

495
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,270
often but it is still many of my

496
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,110
colleagues do and it's it's an excellent

497
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,879
tool I think if I possible users at this

498
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,830
phase this is where you're gonna be at

499
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,179
numerating who works there that's

500
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,418
basically the goal you're going after

501
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:34,470
pulling as many names that you can past

502
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:36,480
or present and putting them to a list to

503
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,520
then be transformed based on the the

504
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,309
patterns identified during the previous

505
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,379
stage so LinkedIn is probably the most

506
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:47,220
valuable target here from my experience

507
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,200
simply because it tends to be a socially

508
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,940
accepted way for people to correlate to

509
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,030
a company without having a company

510
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,220
directory on the website the only thing

511
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,658
with LinkedIn is that when you attempt

512
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,460
to go to a company page and make that

513
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:01,440
navigation typically they're gonna

514
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,630
require you to have some form of degree

515
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,539
of relationship with individuals to then

516
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,760
be able to see their name that's the

517
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:10,080
benefit where LinkedIn Lyon accounts I

518
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,940
don't know how many of you are familiar

519
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,120
with that but it's LinkedIn open

520
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,770
networking is what Lyon stands for

521
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,439
LinkedIn Lyons will connect with almost

522
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,539
anyone just simply as a way to try to

523
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,520
prevent gatekeeping and allowing people

524
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:27,150
to come into industries that may be more

525
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:31,770
difficult to to kind of pull that all

526
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:36,390
together typically it's not necessarily

527
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:38,850
a difficult way to find even if you

528
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,100
don't have a lion your way into a

529
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,418
company and be able to see the listing

530
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,939
you know a decent persona will get you

531
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:46,740
in but even beyond that a lot of search

532
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,970
engines for public profiles you can

533
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:53,250
actually directly do searches around a

534
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:55,640
in title and do specifics like -

535
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:58,740
LinkedIn or the - the company name

536
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,539
insight LinkedIn and you can pull back a

537
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,830
list of users that have public profiles

538
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,629
without ever having that degree of

539
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,820
relationship so that's another way that

540
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,260
you can kind of work around it company

541
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,610
directories obviously come into play

542
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,890
here

543
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,419
that's a huge source of knowledge if

544
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,180
they're available and publicly I'm

545
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,160
online social media I don't tend to find

546
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,110
as often sometimes you'll get lucky

547
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,940
there it's kind of hard to make the

548
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,280
correlations and a lot of times you get

549
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,600
a lot of false positives search engines

550
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,210
as I said you know you can do those

551
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,760
there's particular places that proper

552
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:31,640
terms at Google dork for it you can kind

553
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,440
of identify very particular patterns and

554
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,710
and then utilize those in certain events

555
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,410
or just to find users another kind of

556
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:41,540
gray area of open source intelligence is

557
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:44,390
metadata scraping from public files or

558
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,260
files that are hosted on a website that

559
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,520
a user has of some sort of web server

560
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:52,070
grabbing those files down and then

561
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,080
enumerated the metadata out of them to

562
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:58,399
find users is a great way to identify a

563
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,290
company that may be using usernames that

564
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,090
are non-standard or not the local part

565
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,250
of the email address obviously that's

566
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,919
something that will kind of break the

567
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,570
chain that I have currently right and if

568
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,910
you're not aware of that

569
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,950
fairly early on you can spend a lot of

570
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,420
time generating these these possible

571
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,950
user names only to find that the user

572
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,650
names actually an alpha character

573
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,140
followed by multiple numerix right so

574
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:23,200
some really cool tools on the scraping

575
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,240
for metadata power meta meta groove

576
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,070
automatic medical file I'm sorry and

577
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,360
many others custom scripting you can do

578
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,850
this tends to be kind of an area where

579
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,740
I'll go to from time to time I'm not

580
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,169
gonna always do it depending on if I

581
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,820
already have some insight but typically

582
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:44,090
it's something worth doing if you're not

583
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,169
certain why a particular you're not

584
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,310
getting results in some of your other

585
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:51,380
attacks so attacking users and emails

586
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:53,870
obviously the easy one is a phishing

587
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,520
campaign taking those email addresses

588
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,100
that you've enumerated putting them to

589
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,270
direct use by emailing users with the

590
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,520
general information that you've already

591
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,590
enumerated about the company can give

592
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,470
you some very success depending on the

593
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,300
target and especially the more general

594
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,700
information you gathered as I said

595
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,350
that's the foundation so piling that in

596
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,210
if you find out they may be going

597
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,280
through some form of company transition

598
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,140
or something of that nature that can be

599
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,139
extremely powerful ammo to the NPAC

600
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,090
behind a phishing campaign

601
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,340
building possible username list as I

602
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:27,080
said in the previous slide same idea

603
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,360
basically taking those users that you

604
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,040
identified that do work at that location

605
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,260
I guess at that point employees taking

606
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,020
those employees appending them into the

607
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,490
standards around email addresses and

608
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,170
things of that nature to then generate

609
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,930
lists that can be done very easily with

610
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,980
Python scripts or things of that nature

611
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,150
there's plenty of tools out there that

612
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,350
can do it which we'll get into in a

613
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:50,270
minute but it basically passed referring

614
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:52,459
still valuable you can use those

615
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:55,220
usernames against any service to try

616
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,750
basic passwords season twenty twenty

617
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,660
exclamation mark and all the other

618
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,520
Commons and check for previous breaches

619
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,470
so if you do get you email addresses

620
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,150
that you have identified as valid by

621
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,190
some manner whether that be through a

622
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,320
web app that's giving a verbose error

623
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,420
message on login or something of that

624
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,060
nature or you have an OWI server which

625
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:16,430
makes it really easy you know take that

626
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,230
information and run it through previous

627
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,780
you know information like searches have

628
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,880
I been pwned by Troy Hein great tool for

629
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:25,010
defense as well but it's also something

630
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,480
that can give an attacker insight into

631
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,070
whether this individual has been

632
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,050
compromised before maybe they're still

633
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:36,340
reusing this password somewhere else so

634
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:41,240
defending users and email addresses is

635
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:43,820
primarily around kind of the unfortunate

636
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,650
situation of security by obscurity which

637
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,090
of course as we know is not security at

638
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,000
all but it does make it more difficult

639
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,790
for an attacker non-standard email

640
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,320
formats is very frustrating for people

641
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,320
who are going to be dependent on tools

642
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,169
to generate that information for them

643
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,879
you have seen first or one that I saw at

644
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,950
one point that about broke my mine for a

645
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,160
moment was first initial middle name

646
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,720
last initial as the the email layout and

647
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,570
although that's still something that an

648
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,160
analyst that sits down and performs you

649
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,450
know check on or an attacker of the

650
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,940
system and performs a check on could

651
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:20,450
very easily create a custom script to

652
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:22,520
put together a trivial trivial action

653
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,990
there it's not something that you're

654
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,760
typically going to find in the common

655
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,170
tool sets so if it's someone who's more

656
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,220
dependent on the tools you may be able

657
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:34,100
to to escape that it also can be

658
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,940
extremely valuable to vary the styling

659
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,189
and the form

660
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,780
emails internally if possible so each

661
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,120
department has a different styling of

662
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,040
the email layout for the local part that

663
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,800
can be extremely frustrating to an

664
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,930
attacker because the the list gets

665
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,560
ever-growing larger and larger as you're

666
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,790
trying to make the all possible

667
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,710
enumerations of this which makes it

668
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,120
easier for defenders to detect this type

669
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,350
of attack all right especially if you're

670
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,280
going to be going for Mike a password

671
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:03,379
spray or something of that nature so you

672
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,420
separate you know difficult to guess

673
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,830
usernames don't make the local part of

674
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,780
your email address the username

675
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,610
necessarily there's other alternatives

676
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,710
that you can do that are better options

677
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,939
and be careful who you add on LinkedIn

678
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,920
as I said the minute that you add

679
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,920
someone on LinkedIn you're adding them

680
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,600
as a degree and everyone that you know

681
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,910
and everyone they know just became

682
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,199
correlated to that person at least to

683
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,420
the point of being able to see their

684
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,200
name and their company affiliation so

685
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:32,750
keep that in mind for passwords and

686
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,970
secrets this one tends to be a lot where

687
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:39,260
people don't believe it until they see

688
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:42,890
it necessarily this happens a lot where

689
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,420
especially obsoleted technologies such

690
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,980
as forms like Google Groups things of

691
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,320
that nature where people were using them

692
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,020
prior to maybe migrating into an

693
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,840
internal teams or something you know I

694
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,610
guess like something of that nature if

695
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,050
there was ever a shadow IT presence

696
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,610
before or if there was ever like

697
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,960
documentation that was being publicly

698
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,179
shared and maybe they didn't want to

699
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,730
have to worry about adding everyone each

700
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,380
time that they got new people you may

701
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,210
run into public Google Groups or things

702
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,550
of that nature that you can enumerate

703
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,290
through and identify processes and

704
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,450
things of that nature have found

705
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:17,000
documented processes and Trello boards

706
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,730
before that in concluded information

707
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,550
such as usernames and passwords so

708
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,560
always something to be aware of belief

709
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,480
Trello now by default it's private so

710
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,100
you do have to forcefully make it public

711
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,470
there multiple error warning messages

712
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,830
but still something that was out there

713
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,300
and still is wiki pages blogs things of

714
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,240
that nature I don't run into those as

715
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,220
often sometimes if the company has them

716
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,470
and they've just forgotten them with

717
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:46,220
legacy situation you may run into that

718
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,470
but it's not as prevalent videoso

719
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,240
mentioned in the beginning that

720
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,669
typically leave videos and pictures till

721
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,250
much later in the the process well this

722
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:56,960
is where I tend to come back to those

723
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:59,450
videos and pictures can give you a ton

724
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,260
of insight to secrets and possible keys

725
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:05,630
passwords physical keys physical badges

726
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,370
things of that nature so much of that

727
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,679
can be seen in videos because people

728
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,658
don't necessarily think through how the

729
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,460
marketing video is viewing the

730
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:15,260
background right they're focused on the

731
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,730
initial shot they may not even have a

732
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,370
blurring in the background you'll see

733
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,830
that a lot more with older videos but

734
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:23,389
we're training videos as well many a

735
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:25,580
time I've jumped on to a site where

736
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:27,200
someone has been given a seminar and you

737
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,980
hit the seminar and you look back in on

738
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,200
the whiteboard

739
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,700
there's credentials right - probably a

740
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,400
wireless network or something of that

741
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,890
nature I've seen that multiple times in

742
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,620
multiple environments and it's something

743
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,270
to keep aware of right it's not just

744
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,129
YouTube as soon as this VMO find out

745
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:46,039
what that int that group is using

746
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:48,620
identify those videos and see what you

747
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,970
can see sometimes it's gonna be too poor

748
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,408
of a quality as far as the videos

749
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,600
resolution goes to be able to pull

750
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:55,789
interesting information other times it's

751
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,789
gonna be as plain as day to anyone that

752
00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:00,710
was willing to look outside of the

753
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:04,429
directed scope of a video and images in

754
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:06,470
the same format for finding public code

755
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:08,419
repositories today is a little bit

756
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:11,600
harder than it used to be unless it's

757
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:13,370
been purposely open sourced even still

758
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,469
if you do run into this situation

759
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:16,908
check for uploaded config files a lot of

760
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,950
repositories are trying to prevent

761
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:21,710
people from uploading secrets anymore

762
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,330
API keys passwords it still happens

763
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,440
despite the best effort that you know

764
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,600
there are those developers that will

765
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,789
just completely ignore warnings I used

766
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,809
to be one at one point before I turn to

767
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:34,340
security so I can attest to that

768
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:36,379
so you kind of have to really consider

769
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,850
that and you know there's been there's

770
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,590
an awkward moment of how making sure

771
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:42,080
that you're properly deleting it and not

772
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:44,059
just resubmitting them and creating a

773
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,809
history situation where the history can

774
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:49,639
be reviewed for credentials attacking

775
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:52,190
passwords and secrets obviously the

776
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,789
there's the blatant one which is if

777
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,110
you've identified credentials via a

778
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:58,610
repository for a particular service to

779
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,439
try the credentials on that service if

780
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,719
you've identified credentials via a

781
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,430
white board or something

782
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,870
go check those against wireless network

783
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:07,000
if you've identified credentials on a

784
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,649
sticky note in a video go check those

785
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,740
for a D or something of that nature

786
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:14,070
right there's the obvious side but even

787
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,540
if the credentials aren't immediately

788
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,820
active right if they've been deprecated

789
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,100
in some manner they're still valuable

790
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,360
there's credential stuffing you can use

791
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,909
those credentials across multiple

792
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,070
applications password reuse as I said is

793
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:29,800
still a thing so you may run into that

794
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:32,169
and be able to utilize that there's also

795
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,690
the the pattern drivet deriving patterns

796
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,340
out of them so obviously there's the the

797
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,530
common one that everyone laughs at which

798
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:43,270
is the season year and an exclamation

799
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:44,620
mark right taking that in most any

800
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,030
attacker is gonna be able to glide to

801
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,280
that and guess that the next one maybe

802
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,050
spring or summer right but there's also

803
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,030
the other side of that which is phrases

804
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,090
that people will typically use an

805
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:56,889
example maybe be like this is a password

806
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:58,870
let's say for our web portal so this is

807
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,570
a password web portal one right or a

808
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,580
company named bang well if I take that

809
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,919
and move it into a situation where I

810
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,449
need to get access to another service

811
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,100
right and they named it after the

812
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,950
service and this is a password that

813
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:15,070
service name one bang or whatever will

814
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:16,660
more than likely give us the same result

815
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,980
so be looking for those types of

816
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,670
patterns out of any credentials that you

817
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,330
accumulate as you're going through this

818
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:27,250
process with social engineering there

819
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,409
was been a lot of attackers actually

820
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:32,290
utilized this methodology it's something

821
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:34,420
very effective if you many of you will

822
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:36,129
probably remember a few years ago there

823
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,410
was a situation where there were

824
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:40,300
sufficient campaign being sent out where

825
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:43,870
people were attempting to exploit the

826
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,950
fear of public shame for someone who the

827
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,379
attacker would claim that they had

828
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,690
gotten ahold of a video of them in a

829
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,240
compromising situation and they would

830
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:54,460
include a previous password from a known

831
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,640
data breach for that email address and

832
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,170
in hopes to force that user to believe

833
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,420
them that they were able to compromise

834
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:02,740
their system so with social engineering

835
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,810
especially to those that don't have a

836
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,630
very strong understanding of computing

837
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:10,389
it can be extremely impactful to them to

838
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:12,340
see what they believe and hold as

839
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,050
something that shouldn't be publicly

840
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,860
available at all and

841
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:19,659
if can give validity to a threat right

842
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,520
so kind of comes into play there and

843
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,710
then from a physical security standpoint

844
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,389
this kind of comes back around if you

845
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,370
see pictures of keys if you see pictures

846
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,840
of badges things of that nature there's

847
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,850
a ton of information you can pull from

848
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,189
that if you see a picture of a key and

849
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,810
it's high enough resolution or even if

850
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,920
it's low resolution but you can get it

851
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,240
laid out just right

852
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,660
there's many a talk out there about

853
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,790
people cutting keys from the bit layout

854
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,200
of the key put you can put them over

855
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:47,200
well there's a grid overlays that are

856
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,930
publicly available to cut a key those

857
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,680
all come into play here clamshell badges

858
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:57,550
the old-school kind of the 125 kilohertz

859
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:01,390
badges 26 bit or 35 bits hidden readers

860
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:04,000
right those badges a lot of times we'll

861
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,530
have numeric values written on them from

862
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,950
time to calm those can actually be the

863
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,760
badge number and the facility code

864
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,470
alternatively you may run into a

865
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,420
situation where you see a barcode on the

866
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,280
badge if you scan there you know

867
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,420
obviously from a user standpoint you

868
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,310
don't really think much about that

869
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:20,410
barcode being visible from an attacker

870
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:22,450
standpoint we can interpret that barcode

871
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:24,610
and it typically is something such as

872
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,930
the badge number facility code and for

873
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:30,070
sensitive information that you don't

874
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:33,160
want to be giving away so how do we

875
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:35,200
defend this obviously the primary amount

876
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,060
defense is to know what's out there be

877
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,850
aware of what you have going on in your

878
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:43,840
own environment around shadow i.t around

879
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:45,490
any form of external systems know how

880
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,530
they're being used and by what

881
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:50,590
departments and what they're storing in

882
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:52,120
those systems establish an end-of-life

883
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,980
process so this is what bites alot of

884
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,530
people is as they're migrating from tool

885
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,080
to tool they never really set a process

886
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:01,300
to handle ending the usage of that

887
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,830
previously used service so make sure

888
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,659
that you have a defined end of life

889
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,149
process and how to handle that service

890
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,050
once it's been completely you know

891
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,780
disregarded as far as the company goes

892
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:13,560
make sure that that's useful and not

893
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,730
something that's too difficult to follow

894
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:18,010
and something that if you do have a

895
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:20,050
shadow IT environment that they will try

896
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,670
to follow it as well when moving away

897
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,350
from the shadow IT environment as you

898
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,780
bring them back into the standard

899
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,589
environment when we discuss later on

900
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,549
about system information

901
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:32,158
Kentucky audits a source code management

902
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:34,469
know where your source code is why is it

903
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,899
there who needs access to it why do they

904
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:37,979
have access to it obviously with open

905
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:40,799
source intelligence we're talking about

906
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:43,589
this from a very a very public viewpoint

907
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,299
but if you are in an internal situation

908
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:47,070
and I get a hold of a low privileged

909
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,889
user and they have access to a source

910
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:51,779
code repository my first question should

911
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:53,968
probably be why why did they have access

912
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:56,549
to that did they truly need access to it

913
00:33:53,969 --> 00:34:01,349
so conduct frequent audits of who has

914
00:33:56,549 --> 00:34:03,269
access to your source good with systems

915
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:05,729
and source code distance to be where

916
00:34:03,269 --> 00:34:08,279
you're going to be pulling the most data

917
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:10,049
from an attacker standpoint to move into

918
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:15,418
the next phase so this is going to be

919
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:17,940
information that's kind of an immediate

920
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:20,609
translation phase if you will with

921
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,859
domain information Whois information DNS

922
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:24,389
records subdomains all of that are

923
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:26,098
extremely valuable you can pull that

924
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:28,440
those of course correlate to some form

925
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:30,569
of IP address or some form of cayenne

926
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,679
that gives you more insight into the

927
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,940
environment they're using whether

928
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,549
they're in a cloud environment whether

929
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,918
they're on prim who's you know who's

930
00:34:35,549 --> 00:34:40,649
managing the situation it there's

931
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,000
there's all of that information publicly

932
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:44,308
out there and available Whois

933
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,619
information will also give you unique

934
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:48,599
inside that you can kind of dig into by

935
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:50,190
looking at email addresses that the

936
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,450
domain was registered with what other

937
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,020
domains have been registered with that

938
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,939
email address

939
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,980
what other domains have been registered

940
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:57,869
under a particular company making those

941
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,880
correlations and then continuing to dig

942
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:02,430
through the same way in a loop as we'll

943
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,650
get through later it gives a lot of

944
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:06,058
insight to a lot of hosts that maybe

945
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:09,029
even the client didn't realize we're

946
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:10,470
publicly available so make sure to if

947
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:12,029
you're on the defending side make sure

948
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,828
that you know what's out there and that

949
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:15,839
you're doing this yourself from an

950
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:17,520
attacker standpoint you know that we're

951
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,859
going after those unknown hosts so be

952
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,190
willing to dig in really far and do this

953
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:25,558
loop multiple times public ports and

954
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,180
services typically this is where an

955
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:28,920
attacker is going to move into active

956
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,950
reconnaissance and start throwing scans

957
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,740
at systems but if I find myself in a

958
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:36,660
situation where I'm dealing with a

959
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,308
assessment that's not going to provide

960
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,500
me a whitelist or something of that

961
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:41,910
nature or

962
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,120
except list or something of that nature

963
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:49,109
for traffic then I'm going to go ahead

964
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:50,640
and move into a kind of more stealthy

965
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,050
approach which is to use these public

966
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,460
scanners that already provide

967
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:58,080
information for me from like since sto

968
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,940
showed and things of that nature they

969
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,740
can provide port information as well as

970
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,240
the services running showed em premium

971
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,890
actually will give you a screen shot of

972
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:07,439
if it tries to make a connection and

973
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:09,180
what the view look like since this will

974
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,430
give you header information depending

975
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,319
and you can kind of start to build a

976
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,940
system for Sona around what the system's

977
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,190
supposed to be doing and how it's

978
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,260
supposed to be implemented for their

979
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,850
environment and the more that you can

980
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,950
understand around the personas of each

981
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:24,299
system the more you become begin to

982
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,129
understand their network without ever

983
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,620
having touched it and so it can be a

984
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:32,340
really powerful tool without having to

985
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,810
risk getting blocked via scans and then

986
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,790
of course as we mentioned before finding

987
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:39,509
code repositories that's kind of the

988
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:42,150
Holy Grail situation it opens up so many

989
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:45,240
possibilities and so much time can be

990
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:48,030
spent in that realm that is you can deep

991
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,640
dive to find low level exploitations you

992
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,400
can find single injection that would be

993
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,870
blind and especially as situations where

994
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,790
you're dealing with time-based blind

995
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,230
injections right you're not going to be

996
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,730
able to pinpoint those very easily from

997
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,740
an external viewpoint in which you have

998
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,360
a very particular query your

999
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:06,149
standardized set of queries that work

1000
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,420
frequently mmm a lot of times especially

1001
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:11,610
on unstandardized or if there's a very

1002
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,080
particular layout for the day query

1003
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:17,510
you're not gonna be able to pinpoint

1004
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:20,100
that things also such as deserialization

1005
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,390
vulnerabilities so on so forth is just a

1006
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:25,049
whole number that opens up with code

1007
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:26,850
repositories attacking standard

1008
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:29,990
information or system information and

1009
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:32,670
source code at this point it's around

1010
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:34,890
the the standard tactics right taking

1011
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,990
that information enumerated that

1012
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:39,080
bringing it back determining if there's

1013
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:41,640
owner abilities out for those versions

1014
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,190
understanding why those versions are

1015
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,330
employed and if they have any

1016
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:49,010
differentials or the standard falls that

1017
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:51,480
people fall into I always suggest

1018
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:53,010
performing active recon before you move

1019
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,180
into the attacking phase for system

1020
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,150
information

1021
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:59,370
because you need to verify that that's

1022
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,600
up-to-date and hasn't been outdated

1023
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,850
especially if you're dealing with a

1024
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,810
crowd cloud environment where services

1025
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:08,370
could have been changed also social

1026
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,960
engineering for system information of

1027
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,940
source code this would be a very

1028
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,440
targeted principle this is going to be

1029
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:15,450
if you're going after helpdesk or if

1030
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,250
you're going after a technical

1031
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,930
individual and you want to come in as

1032
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,850
maybe a consultant viewpoint or

1033
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,470
something of that nature and be able to

1034
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,630
act as though you have a very intricate

1035
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,609
knowledge of how their networks are

1036
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:29,760
operating to try to build that trust

1037
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:31,080
very quickly it can be helpful if you

1038
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,600
are going to be putting on the persona

1039
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,520
of the helpdesk and contacting a user

1040
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:40,380
but by and large this level of

1041
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:42,570
information not as much with this you're

1042
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,550
when you get into the code review aspect

1043
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,920
as we talked about identifying those

1044
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:50,520
exploits that are difficult to to locate

1045
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,530
in publicly available code can it can

1046
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:55,200
lead to exploits but I'll also warn once

1047
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,240
again time is a valuable asset when it

1048
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,049
comes to these types of situations and

1049
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:03,149
remembering that can give you unless

1050
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,120
this code base is very prominent and

1051
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:07,440
used frequently right and in which case

1052
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,350
there are other better resources which

1053
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,720
we'll get into here in a minute to be

1054
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:15,360
doing so from an attacker standpoint you

1055
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:20,459
may not have as much value going down

1056
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:23,070
that rabbit hole for too long defending

1057
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:25,350
system information in source code who is

1058
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:28,320
protect or privacy protection is always

1059
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:30,330
a good idea even for major and larger

1060
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,940
companies just having that protection in

1061
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:35,790
place to prevent users from being able

1062
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,350
to make those correlations it does make

1063
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,900
it difficult on the offenders as well

1064
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:43,319
being able to pinpoint but it's the

1065
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,870
situation of it's a give and take the

1066
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,030
auditing external host frequently is

1067
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:49,560
something that regardless of your

1068
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:51,930
viewpoint on the rest of this you should

1069
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,430
be doing forgetting an external host is

1070
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:55,680
out there and having a vulnerable

1071
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:57,540
service on it is a very problematic

1072
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,020
thing as we've seen with so many times

1073
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:04,500
snv's issues so know what's out there

1074
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,750
know your network right ensure that all

1075
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,890
the services are needed publicly if you

1076
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,410
have a hose

1077
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:12,420
that is serving a web server and you are

1078
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,879
publicly serving the database that's on

1079
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,069
that same server that's utilized for the

1080
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,119
web server you don't need that database

1081
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:20,220
publicly available

1082
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,049
they'll kill that port right to make

1083
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:25,078
sure that you're not allowing that

1084
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:27,180
access will kill the port externally so

1085
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,010
make sure that your you understand what

1086
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:32,578
services you truly need externally and

1087
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:34,230
why this is also this can be extremely

1088
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:36,569
difficult for larger companies but it's

1089
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,010
still something valuable to be doing and

1090
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:40,890
if it's not being done definitely need

1091
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:43,529
to be considered performing source code

1092
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,480
reviews is an excellent option if you

1093
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:47,010
have a lot of open source projects and

1094
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,700
that you're going to be dependent on

1095
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:52,920
them to remain that way you kind of have

1096
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,078
to defend depend on the community it may

1097
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,539
be a good move to not only do it through

1098
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:00,510
your you know a standard code review but

1099
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,430
also to in employee bug bounty programs

1100
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:04,950
and things of that nature to try to keep

1101
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:08,279
that code secured as best as possible

1102
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:10,169
and prevent that information from

1103
00:41:08,279 --> 00:41:15,390
falling into the wrong hands to be used

1104
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:18,180
and the people you don't want with with

1105
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:20,490
all of this a lot of these issues are

1106
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:23,190
going to spawn from people taking action

1107
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:24,868
on their own so discuss best practices

1108
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,059
with your admins provision their

1109
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:28,259
repositories that they need make sure

1110
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:29,789
that they have the the team

1111
00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:32,910
communication resources that they need

1112
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:34,619
and want because those avoiding those

1113
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,660
situations avoiding those discussions

1114
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:38,309
with your admins and developers is going

1115
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,440
to lead to that awkward moment of shadow

1116
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:45,210
Otte environments throughout and those

1117
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:47,339
can be extremely impactful so some quick

1118
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:49,680
final thoughts kind of wrapping up here

1119
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:53,519
this is a rinse and repeat methodology

1120
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,740
right take this and kind of apply a

1121
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:58,740
belief that the original whose name was

1122
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,848
at the OODA loop from military reference

1123
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,279
you know take that observation

1124
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:04,289
orientation make a decision and act upon

1125
00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:05,519
it right and you're gonna be progressing

1126
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:07,920
that throughout this open source

1127
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,808
intelligence process once you've found

1128
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,339
your way through the external and you're

1129
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:12,450
found your way onto the internal network

1130
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:15,058
this isn't over

1131
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:17,038
necessarily as you find new services as

1132
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:19,319
you find new users as you find whatever

1133
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,920
you can rinse and repeat this process to

1134
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:23,560
find more information

1135
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,270
don't get lost in the hunt though

1136
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,759
obviously time is money right and time

1137
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:31,670
is a very valuable thing and a lot of

1138
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,230
times there are a lot of data that you

1139
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:34,520
can be going through especially if

1140
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,990
you're not just looking at the company

1141
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,000
but also looking at the individuals

1142
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:41,390
there's a ton of money that you can

1143
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
spend in hunting that as far as hours go

1144
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:46,009
or you can spend that time maybe looking

1145
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,890
for the easy wins so don't get lost in

1146
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,510
the hunt if you found nothing else and

1147
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:52,940
you just absolutely need something you

1148
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:55,910
know go crazy but it's something to keep

1149
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:58,010
informed and knowledgeable about tom is

1150
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,899
a commodity as I said open-source

1151
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,970
intelligence is only one part of much

1152
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,760
larger assessments by and large so use

1153
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,799
this as a tool as you progress and use

1154
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,590
these methodologies and find your your

1155
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,540
speed you're going to be able to bring

1156
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,370
this together fairly quickly kind of get

1157
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,630
your own mentality down and move through

1158
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:16,400
it and do it quickly

1159
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,750
right it's it's not gonna be something

1160
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,260
that takes you a lot of time but that

1161
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:23,900
being said be weary especially if you

1162
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,670
find yourself with a lot of time left

1163
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,040
and you're just trying to find a way to

1164
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:31,930
piece together these minor little bits

1165
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:34,310
at the end make sure that you're not

1166
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:37,250
spending time there when there could be

1167
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:38,390
much more valuable areas and then the

1168
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,430
biggest one is have fun and teach each

1169
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,379
other none of us are masters of

1170
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:44,419
everything right and especially with

1171
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,790
open source intelligence I am far from a

1172
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:49,280
master of it I know people who are

1173
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:51,020
infinitely better at it than I and I

1174
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,470
have learned so much from them and as

1175
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:57,470
this community and in every way but it's

1176
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:58,910
it's so interesting these types of

1177
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,589
topics to come together and have these

1178
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,560
communications and discuss teachable

1179
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,760
moments even to the client and end users

1180
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,710
those who don't have the technical

1181
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,360
knowledge necessarily because you can

1182
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:10,310
bring that together and bring them into

1183
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,590
the understanding that can help them to

1184
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:14,210
secure themselves and not only their

1185
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:15,920
company but also themselves in their

1186
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:18,050
family as they progress on and learn

1187
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,640
more about these types of external

1188
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:22,700
facing information they're providing to

1189
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:26,359
others so have fun teach each other and

1190
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:32,419
enjoy it so any questions concerns

1191
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:32,859
considerations otherwise let's I talked

1192
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,359
out

1193
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:38,259
I haven't seen anything pop up over

1194
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:42,160
there yet okay does anybody have any

1195
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:45,160
questions for bikes let's see looks like

1196
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,019
I've got I just pulled up discord oh now

1197
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,730
I'm not over in discord sorry okay yeah

1198
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:53,859
no I was gonna check through here and

1199
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:57,759
see multigo I actually don't use multigo

1200
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:59,019
or I haven't primarily simply because I

1201
00:44:57,759 --> 00:45:00,519
haven't ran into a situation where I've

1202
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:02,709
needed to take the time to kind of

1203
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:04,868
compile that data in Mass together I've

1204
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,880
heard that it's an amazing tool by and

1205
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,739
large when I'm taking notes of this

1206
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,950
information I have my own scripts that

1207
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:14,019
are run to kind of pull it together into

1208
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:15,879
notes and stored in locations so it's

1209
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:28,720
just kind of my own thing that I have

1210
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:34,599
together I was trying my best to recover

1211
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:39,488
the data as far as the ransomware

1212
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:42,400
question I'm that's a highly debated

1213
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:44,859
topic I don't know that that's something

1214
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,259
the question for those who are not in

1215
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:49,029
discord is the individual had an

1216
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:50,259
interview question where they were asked

1217
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:53,319
about if they were hit by ransomware

1218
00:45:50,259 --> 00:45:56,739
where they try to pay for the ransom to

1219
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:58,720
recover the data and from my perspective

1220
00:45:56,739 --> 00:46:00,789
there it's it's it's a situation by

1221
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,410
situation basis it

1222
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:04,779
most people will always say you never

1223
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,578
pay the ransom and that tends to be my

1224
00:46:04,779 --> 00:46:07,960
own viewpoint as well simply because it

1225
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:09,069
may be a destructive malware and unless

1226
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,710
you truly understand what you're dealing

1227
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:16,420
with you may never get the information

1228
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:23,829
back anyway but can you tell the sources

1229
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:25,989
for code source code is like github

1230
00:46:23,829 --> 00:46:27,430
repositories bitbucket repositories

1231
00:46:25,989 --> 00:46:29,079
those types of things you're typically

1232
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,419
gonna find if you're if you know the

1233
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:33,549
service you're looking for and you're

1234
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,900
doing searches through that that's gonna

1235
00:46:33,549 --> 00:46:39,009
be how you're gonna find those open

1236
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:42,930
public repositories so that's just kind

1237
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:42,930
of the two bits I have for that

1238
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,029
what tools or frameworks do you used to

1239
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,490
track results from open source

1240
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:51,070
intelligence RG like I had said it's I

1241
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:53,500
kind of keep my own thing I just have a

1242
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:55,390
list of scripts that I kind of use multi

1243
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,460
gives a good one for compiling that I've

1244
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:59,049
heard and there's a quite a few other

1245
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:01,060
sources and tools out there that you can

1246
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,560
use to bring it all together like I said

1247
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:04,000
by and large since I'm kind of moving

1248
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,020
through these quickly I just use what

1249
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,040
I'm comfortable with which is the

1250
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,040
scripts that I wrote so

1251
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:20,050
all right and I don't see any other

1252
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:20,050
questions anything else

1253
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:37,330
it looks like what is your favor over

1254
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:40,060
all open security intelligence and then

1255
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:41,830
the tool list looks like over in the

1256
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:55,140
regular zoom chat I don't know if you

1257
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:57,790
see those yet or I see oh there we go

1258
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:00,910
what's your favorite tool overall for

1259
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:04,630
open source intelligence as far as

1260
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:06,490
favorite tool goes like I said I tend to

1261
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,080
use there's there's a ton of open source

1262
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:10,390
tools out there as I listed through the

1263
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:16,690
slides probably the ones that I use the

1264
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:19,450
most are gonna be around probably a

1265
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:21,460
passive total I use a lot for if I'm in

1266
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,500
the system information phase

1267
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,060
direct linking information I have like I

1268
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,080
said I've got a lot of custom stuff that

1269
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,680
I've written along the way that there

1270
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:31,270
are much better tools out there to do

1271
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,620
but it's just one of those when you're

1272
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:34,660
in the moment like at least for me I

1273
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,549
tend to be really bad about that I'll be

1274
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,649
in the moment and I'll just craft a tool

1275
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:40,450
to handle that situation that I'm in

1276
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,920
right at that moment instead of going

1277
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:44,529
out and trying to find a tool that I can

1278
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,810
familiarize myself with so I have a lot

1279
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:49,870
of those but I would say that probably

1280
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:51,549
the most commonly tool use tool that I'm

1281
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:52,810
using frequently for open source

1282
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,390
intelligence it's probably through

1283
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:57,910
passive total together like I said that

1284
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:59,410
DNS loop getting that information

1285
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,270
identifying the IP addresses pulling

1286
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,950
that back together they have both a free

1287
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:07,320
and a paid version but I didn't just

1288
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:07,319
take with the free cos portions there

1289
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:15,939
all right well if no other questions

1290
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,220
feel free to reach out to me I'll be in

1291
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:21,130
discord for a little bit so feel free to

1292
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:24,299
hit me up there it's brycie there yeah

1293
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,300
and thank you all for your time
