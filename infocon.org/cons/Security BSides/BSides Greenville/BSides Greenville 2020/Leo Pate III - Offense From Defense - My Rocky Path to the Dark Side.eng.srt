awesome

20
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,729
so so I gave this talk in I think

21
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:11,130
earlier this year or want to say maybe

22
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:13,050
January at besides Tampa so I it's if

23
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,958
you were there then I'm sorry there's

24
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,810
there's not much difference but I just

25
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:22,530
really wanted to I I thought that this

26
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:26,190
would be pretty great for the Greenville

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,840
community simply cause a lot of pen

28
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,990
testing and stuff

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,209
there isn't a strong presence of it here

30
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,009
in Charleston there's there's a car in

31
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:38,580
South Carolina excuse me there's a huge

32
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,610
presence you know in a lot of the major

33
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,459
areas like Atlanta in San Francisco and

34
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,830
Seattle and that sort of thing but what

35
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:49,220
I see a lot of in South Carolina is a

36
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,440
lot of IT a lot of network stuff

37
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,580
auditing and compliance and a lot of

38
00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:00,509
blue teen stuff so so essentially this

39
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:03,810
talk is about my path over the last 12

40
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:09,030
years from you know just getting started

41
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:15,000
to where I'm at now and kind of going

42
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:18,150
into it the the the first thing I kind

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,849
of want to start off with was I

44
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,829
you know who who likes these type of

45
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,078
drives right so like if you're going on

46
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:27,510
a road trip or something and you just

47
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:29,579
got you know this open highway you've

48
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,399
got like no traffic here you got no cars

49
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:34,709
on the road right like music is music is

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,420
blaring will pretend that it's it's

51
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:38,280
summer instead of in this picture it

52
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,828
looks like it's in the fall so your

53
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,180
windows are rolled down and you know

54
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:44,340
it's just like a scenic route right

55
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:50,579
there's you've got a lot to kind of take

56
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:52,799
a look at but most of the time my drives

57
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:55,019
across the country are not like this a

58
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:58,470
lot of times it feels like it's like

59
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,299
this right you know just a lot of twists

60
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,870
and turns terrible if you have a stick

61
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,970
shift you know it's not the as you look

62
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,099
it's not the most efficient way from you

63
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,599
know the top of the top of the hill to

64
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,599
the bottom so going from right to left

65
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,129
and then there's really no way to speed

66
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,328
because you're at the mercy of the

67
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:20,250
landscape and then you're if there is

68
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:26,220
traffic on this road you are in for a

69
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:29,220
super long day so living at least me

70
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,750
moving to Greenville and living in you

71
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,109
know the Greenville area like Woodruff

72
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:37,470
Road just is bananas to me and I lived

73
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:39,060
in DC Maryland and Seattle and Woodruff

74
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,510
Road although not as bad as them is

75
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,889
still pretty bad but you know showing

76
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,048
these two pictures showing these two

77
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:48,979
things core you know these two pictures

78
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:52,379
can be correlated to your career as well

79
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:54,959
so regardless of if you're a nympho sec

80
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:56,698
now or you're wanting to get into it or

81
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,470
you're kind of just you know sticking

82
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:01,109
your feet in the in the water so to

83
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,430
speak and trying to learn about it you

84
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:06,049
can typically relate to one of those

85
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:09,090
pitchers in regards to your own career

86
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:12,449
and for me like I said earlier I most

87
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:16,039
definitely relate to the second one my

88
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:19,260
career has been everything but ordinary

89
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:22,048
it seems like I did everything backwards

90
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:26,159
than what is typically you know the

91
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:27,179
typical career path and you know it's

92
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:30,120
just been a lot of twists and turns

93
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,100
uncertainty and then again often at the

94
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,520
mercy of the environment that ever were

95
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,590
Kennan so although I've been doing in

96
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,150
some way shape or form involved in

97
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:43,919
security for 12 years now I feel like I

98
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,870
have barely scratched the surface and I

99
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,920
think the panel talked before he kind of

100
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:54,120
most definitely covered it you know

101
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:56,520
impostor syndrome is real and every day

102
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,680
I'm constantly learning something or I'm

103
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,200
challenging what I have learned which

104
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,360
makes me feel like oh man I thought I

105
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,830
had a good crimp on this and I most

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,070
definitely don't

107
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,599
so this talk again is kind of what I

108
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,630
wanted to do I wanted to share my story

109
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,310
so so this talk is called offense from

110
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,590
defense and then my rocky path to the

111
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:20,250
dark side dark side being offensive

112
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,780
security so a little bit about me I'm

113
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:27,990
currently an application security

114
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:32,969
consultant of the museum I recently left

115
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:34,770
the Army National Guard so was on active

116
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,260
duty the reserves and the National Guard

117
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,630
I kind of ended my career kind of

118
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,070
abruptly and if you want to know more

119
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,570
you can hit me up on the score or

120
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,090
Twitter we can you can most definitely

121
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,469
talk about it but I was a cyber warfare

122
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,299
officer within the South Korean national

123
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,580
guard and I'm currently a technical

124
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,700
4-node carolina's which used to be

125
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:58,050
notice see I'm kind of expanded to the

126
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:00,930
North Carolina community as well but

127
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,830
most definitely a code monkey I normally

128
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:07,920
am working in Python or go but I've been

129
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,539
recently learning Kotlin and you know

130
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,390
trying to brush up on JavaScript and

131
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:17,040
Java and my day to day job originally

132
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:19,409
graduated college of Charleston 2016 I'd

133
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,270
like to build Legos so like I'm a huge

134
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,390
child and I just recently had a newborn

135
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,409
so my wife is constantly saying I have

136
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:29,640
you not to take care of two children and

137
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,220
pursue her the perfect fashion I have

138
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:35,039
you know I know it's a simple recipe but

139
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,620
it's so hard to nail it down and get it

140
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,650
right I haven't been able to do it yet

141
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:43,050
and you having a webcam right now so you

142
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,669
know I decided to put a picture of me as

143
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,010
Clyde the cougar which is called in

144
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:48,680
Charleston's mascot

145
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:51,140
so this is a picture of me when collide

146
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,980
as a mascot got his ring on ring night

147
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:59,090
um so when I first started doing this

148
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:01,790
talk I was like man I have done a lot of

149
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,940
stuff and it's like all over the place

150
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,860
so how can I categorize it and for me I

151
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,490
kind of when I laid it all out and kind

152
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,040
of break it down it seemed like college

153
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:17,210
was me going to college in my college

154
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,910
experience was a huge you know turning

155
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:23,030
point as you'll see in the next slides

156
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:25,820
in regards to my career so a quick

157
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,299
caveat this this kind of talk isn't most

158
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:32,090
definitely a pitch to go to college or a

159
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,070
pitch to you know get certifications or

160
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,630
a pitch to do any of that this is most

161
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,070
definitely just a snapshot of me and

162
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,350
this is kind of like the easiest way

163
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,180
that I could break it down you know to

164
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:47,000
make it easy to understand easy to

165
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:49,120
digest so so essentially my path creek

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,040
college you know if you were going to

167
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,560
you know do a 30,000 foot level snapshot

168
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,650
like this is essentially it I was born

169
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,960
and then obviously and then shortly

170
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,909
thereafter I started I always had a

171
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,580
knack for technology growing up even as

172
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,710
a child my parents loved to tell this

173
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,479
story whether I cannot confirm if this

174
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:14,870
true or not but I as a as a toddler

175
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:18,410
reprogrammed the VCR so the time was

176
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,850
right on the VCR which if showing my age

177
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,850
a little bit even though I was a toddler

178
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,590
like that was that was a skill that

179
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:28,910
eluded everyone you know like the time

180
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:32,990
he was just always 12 and blinking but I

181
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:35,419
had my um with this and you might see

182
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,190
ITA eh right and this is kind of like me

183
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,309
trying to be funny but I T as a hacker

184
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,990
right so I always knew that I wanted to

185
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:43,609
go I wanted to be a hacker I wanted to

186
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,980
be like the cool guys in the movies I

187
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:51,020
could do all the things like I'm in with

188
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:55,010
the sunglasses but it was a long road to

189
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,930
even get there and so I'm originally

190
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,660
from Charleston in South Carolina and

191
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,819
growing up was

192
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,640
kind of born into into poverty like we

193
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:08,170
we weren't my family like we're homeless

194
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,730
but we also weren't pretty well-off so

195
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:15,400
we're this hacker this holiday came to

196
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:21,020
be is how can I do things or get things

197
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:22,550
that typically cost money but I don't

198
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,980
have money so so how do I get around

199
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,810
that right so essentially how do i

200
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,310
bypass these access controls or these

201
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,839
safeguards in place to prevent me from

202
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,469
doing things that I probably shouldn't

203
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:37,250
be doing right and that's kind of where

204
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,770
my experience kind of came from so to

205
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:43,190
speak not breaking laws nothing illegal

206
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:46,160
nothing nothing crazy you know but just

207
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,020
having that tinkering that how do i how

208
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,660
do I get somewhere how do I do something

209
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,120
kind of mentality you know fast forward

210
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,100
a little bit I enlist I enlisted in the

211
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,130
army at 17 became a human resource

212
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,320
specialist actually but I showed you

213
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,910
know through my tech background I mean I

214
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,650
had my first computer was a Compaq

215
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,410
Presario my father bought me when I was

216
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:09,620
like 12 and I like the first thing I did

217
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:11,510
was just tear down this tower and then I

218
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,040
remember my father walking back in and

219
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,220
losing his mind because there were just

220
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,900
pieces all over the place I and then I

221
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,080
had to figure out like okay I took it

222
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,079
apart

223
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,990
like how do I get back together like

224
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,430
that's not so easy um but you know kind

225
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,940
of taking that snapshot and moving

226
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,439
forward

227
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,810
I showed a lot of skill and interest in

228
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,580
IT started taking some you know my

229
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,739
platoon sergeant my military leaders are

230
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,760
always like the Army's hang up for free

231
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,520
college if you're not taking advantage

232
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,610
of it you're you're just a moron

233
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,569
so you know I was like I just graduate I

234
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,070
school like I don't wanna go back to

235
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,660
school and then my leaders were like

236
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,240
stop being stupid like go get this free

237
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,709
money and use it so I started taking

238
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,820
classes and then kind of brought that

239
00:10:53,710 --> 00:11:00,640
into my own army my own army career so

240
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,550
when so when I was in South Korea I

241
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,949
became a sysadmin at 18 for six

242
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,079
different groups that was spread across

243
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,420
five different areas across the entire

244
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,240
country of South Korea so all in all I

245
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,089
responsible for about $250,000 worth of

246
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,950
equipment and some people are like oh

247
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:19,960
man that seems like a pretty cool job

248
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,670
like pretty cool full-time job well the

249
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,830
fun fact is that my full-time job in

250
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,819
South Korea was to be a mailman it was

251
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,950
trying to me to sysadmin

252
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:32,230
so I made sure that people had an

253
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:35,830
amazing Christmas but you know I also it

254
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:38,560
was like who knows tech stuff Oh hate

255
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:44,110
does okay peyt you're our guy now go

256
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:46,119
make it happen so being an additional

257
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,860
duty as the military using military

258
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,350
speak it was like once my full-time job

259
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,920
of being a male-male is done then I got

260
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:56,380
the task to go do all the sysadmin stuff

261
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,890
which you know there's no extra pay or

262
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,920
anything it was just like get it done so

263
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,300
didn't fast forward this at this point I

264
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,729
was on active duty so I was professional

265
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,250
soldier I was a full-time soldier

266
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:12,490
shortly from there moved to was

267
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,130
reassigned to into Texas where I worked

268
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,490
at the NSA for about about a year and a

269
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:21,070
half and it's here that I got to see a

270
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:24,330
lot more behind the curtain in regards

271
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:27,730
to how the United States government does

272
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:29,020
the cybersecurity things and a lot of my

273
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,550
friends were working on a lot of pretty

274
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,680
cool projects I was like oh man we can

275
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,719
do that like that's pretty cool um so it

276
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,500
not only it just fueled my passion a

277
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,500
little bit more um

278
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:43,360
and then after after that year and a

279
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:45,310
half I got vol I'm told that I'm going

280
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,540
to move to a new unit about 30 minutes

281
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,109
down the street and then six months

282
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,490
later I was calling Afghanistan so

283
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:54,250
deployed to Afghanistan and then after

284
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,200
that was like man I'm really tired and I

285
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,520
just want to go back home to Charleston

286
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,530
so decided to go back to school and

287
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:06,939
utilizing the GI Bill again you know

288
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:11,410
went to become a college student so as

289
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:13,540
you can see you know my my you know

290
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:16,420
relevant to information security just

291
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,640
kind of exploded at this point College

292
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,170
College was a defining moment for me

293
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,410
because you see that I split off and

294
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:27,520
essentially three different areas so

295
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:30,100
those three areas are the commercial

296
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,650
space so like private industry going to

297
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,900
go work for you know companies and in

298
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:38,350
the military side of things which is in

299
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,990
yellow working as a reservist and then

300
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,150
as a National Guardsman so doing things

301
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,240
at the federal the state and even the

302
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,100
county level in South Carolina and in

303
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,370
the red is kind of like the academia

304
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,770
college route so breaking these down

305
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:58,900
even further you know starting with the

306
00:13:53,770 --> 00:14:01,180
commercial side I became an intern at a

307
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,090
security consulting company in

308
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,949
Charleston called site area not to be

309
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:09,430
confused with cetera which is a defense

310
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,810
contract company so start as an intern

311
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:14,859
there were like three co-founders and

312
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:16,530
myself like I'm stringing up cable or

313
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:21,340
helping stringing up cable and and

314
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:25,449
install like security alarm systems like

315
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:27,310
cameras and hit systems you know helping

316
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:31,420
set up like internal infrastructure like

317
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:33,910

319
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,490
company's infrastructure of stuff at a

320
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:43,569
time and it's funny that I actually met

321
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:47,260
the one of the one of the co-founders at

322
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,390

324
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,080

328
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,730
it was most definitely pretty

329
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,130
interesting so startup ended in and

330
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,650
turned that summer when school started

331
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,750
back up uh became assistant system

332
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,510
administrator

333
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,090
you know just building out a sim

334
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:18,250
building out their login capability like

335
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:20,500
building out all these things which were

336
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,140
great projects for you know an intern

337
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,080
college student to do and then even

338
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,000
while in college were cramped up so got

339
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,490
to cut my teeth a little bit on the

340
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,410
consulting side of things was paired up

341
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,270
with like principal and senior

342
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,370
consultants where I was able to kind of

343
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,960
learn a little bit and not only learned

344
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,070
that IT side of things and security side

345
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,440
of things but also learn the business

346
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,610
side of things as well like how to how

347
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,300
do you talk to clients how do you

348
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,020
interact with clients and and that sort

349
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,609
of thing

350
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:53,829
so simultaneously I decided at my time

351
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,320
in the army I didn't want it to be over

352
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,310
I must definitely liked it but I didn't

353
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,150
want to be a professional soldier

354
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:03,699
anymore so decided to enroll in ROTC at

355
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,420
the Citadel and go to school at College

356
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,820
in Charleston and became an ROTC cadet

357
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,280
while I was an ROTC cadet was in the

358
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,590
reserves there is a transportation to

359
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,510
transportation unit in Charleston they

360
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:21,490
essentially their whole job is logistics

361
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:24,430
I was doing Human Resources for them and

362
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,650
then I talked to one of the recruiters

363
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,900
on the civils campus reached out to me

364
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,819
and said hey I heard you do cyber stuff

365
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,110
I heard you do security stuff and I was

366
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,090
like yeah is that you want to join the

367
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,200
National Guard and I was like well I'm

368
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,810
already part of the reserves and he's

369
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,850
like well South Carolina it's a cyber

370
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,260
team and I was like oh awesome can I

371
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,630
talk to them and he's like I don't know

372
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,770
who to talk to but they have one and I

373
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:49,320
was like okay well thank you so um you

374
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,520
know doing it doing a Google search

375
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,410
doing some LinkedIn stuff I eventually

376
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:58,810
found my mentor who you know long story

377
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,990
short met with we met when we had a

378
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:04,448
couple beers and then eventually decided

379
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,399
to bring me onto his team doing

380
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:09,339
you know essentially blue team type

381
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:11,559
stuff for the National Guard so this

382
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,688
team was developed as a at the time

383
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,990
nikki Haley was our governor and she

384
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:20,079
wanted in the event that something was

385
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,990
to happen in the state of South Carolina

386
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:26,888
she wanted a military she wanted to have

387
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,720
a military option response to it and in

388
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:30,309
regards to you know cybersecurity

389
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,429
threats which was on the rise at this

390
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:37,120
point she most definitely wanted to to

391
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:39,370
have some some elements to that so this

392
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,260
team was kind of built based upon that

393
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:46,059
idea so so as ROTC cadet got to

394
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:49,120
eventually fill the role of a defense

395
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:51,059
cyber operations team leader which led a

396
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,340
team of about two to three soldiers

397
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:55,690
actually about two to five soldiers

398
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,730
depending on you know what was being

399
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:01,630
asked and you know what what needed to

400
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:06,220
be done and over the three years that I

401
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:08,799
was in school kind of were dual hats we

402
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,620
had we had some special missions come up

403
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,908
where you know they were likely I think

404
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,768
you'd be a great person to kind of come

405
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:16,990
watch out for this and kind of lead this

406
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:20,049
effort um you know can you do it as I

407
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,360
guess sure so held multiple hats

408
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:24,279
incident response commander working with

409
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,928
industry partners to kind of help figure

410
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,269
out that stuff in their network as well

411
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:30,610
as you know just doing the day-to-day

412
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:33,309
you know managerial in charge of

413
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:35,168
soldiers type of deal as well as special

414
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:38,320
missions so we have like these special

415
00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:40,210
things that popped up and then in

416
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,129
college so College of Charleston if you

417
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,590
don't know is a liberal arts institution

418
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:46,559
in Charleston South Carolina was founded

419
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,600
in 1770 and they have a pretty good

420
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,658
computer science program however at the

421
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,360
time security was taught in none of

422
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:58,350
their classes it was more so on how do

423
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,799
you build it and even then their

424
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:06,340
curriculum was slightly dated so I

425
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,750
became the annoying guy in the classroom

426
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,870
asking well how does security fit into

427
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:14,200
this and that sort of thing so moving

428
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,459
into that decided because there was no

429
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,740
security presence I'm she's going to

430
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,400
make one so I founded the cyber security

431
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,140
Club it called

432
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,690
traulsen which later you know as I found

433
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:29,740
out last semester actually so I founded

434
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:32,880
it about 2014-2015 it's now one of the

435
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:37,120
largest organizations on their campus

436
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,390
which is pretty cool so not only did I

437
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,489
was able to like create something out of

438
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,610
nothing but then I was also able to

439
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,620
rally people behind me you know in an

440
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,419
effort to kind of help build something

441
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,090
to raise awareness and that sort of

442
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:55,330
thing I can tell you all types of funny

443
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:58,060
stories and interacting with the the

444
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,470
college itself and saying well I want to

445
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,060
create this cybersecurity club and I

446
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,830
want to you know I got plans to help

447
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:06,340
build a lab for security students and

448
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:08,260
I'm working with these industry people

449
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,820
around around the low country to help

450
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,260
donate equipment like can you help me

451
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,320
set up a lab and they're like you want

452
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:17,320
to do but like what are you trying to do

453
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:19,929
you know so lots of funny stories but at

454
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,419
the end um after graduating college

455
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:23,830
decided that I was you know I have fun

456
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:26,740
at Soteria but I would kind of wanted to

457
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:32,020
expand my horizons a little bit so move

458
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:34,510
forward to become a stock analyst at at

459
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:40,660
SPAWAR which i think is now Nick which

460
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:42,250
or niche ni WH or ni WC so became a

461
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,750
stock analyst for defense health agency

462
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:48,340
so all the military the medical

463
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:53,650
buildings and units and things across

464
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:55,629
the entire world that were us-based I

465
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:59,890
sat on their network looking for bets

466
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:02,290
though so eventually at the end again

467
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:05,710
just to reiterate college graduate army

468
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:09,129
officer and in a stock analyst so my

469
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:11,170
past post college so this one was a

470
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:14,290
little challenging because I went again

471
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:17,170
super-weird went through like a lot of

472
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:21,159
different things but after commissioned

473
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:22,780
in the office as an officer in the

474
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,270
National Guard my official title became

475
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:28,780
cyber warfare officer and then from

476
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:32,200
there I guess kind of doing it in order

477
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:36,120
I was a still main

478
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,260
my sake analyst role until we got orders

479
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:45,219
sake National Guard got orders to

480
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:48,100
mobilize so had to put a hold on my you

481
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,870
know civilian career as a sake analyst

482
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,789
and just security professional and it

483
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:56,199
could be a military opposite so

484
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:58,029
essentially did that I had some

485
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,320
broadening roles went to school for four

486
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:04,870
months came back worked as like a

487
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,700
communications officer essentially how

488
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,408
do we communicate on the battlefield

489
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:14,169
kind of deal but our battlefield was

490
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:17,500
like an office and and then also

491
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:18,610
developed some security training for for

492
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,630
the soldiers that were assigned to me

493
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,870
and the soldiers that were part of my

494
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:25,539
team for an entire unit of roughly a

495
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:28,719
hundred soldiers overall and in

496
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:30,370
preparation for this mobilization so

497
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,519
then we mobilized my official tile

498
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:35,559
became crew commander and then shortly

499
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:39,610
shortly during this mobilization also

500
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:41,740
became an operator so kind of doing you

501
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:45,699
know just stuff for the government they

502
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,830
needed to get done so after I quickly of

503
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,960
my mobilization I was at a crossroads

504
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,990
again a lot of crossroads so the first

505
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,059
one was what do i do do I go back to

506
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:58,299
being a sake analyst which is you know I

507
00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:02,440
still have that possibility they stay

508
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:05,529
held a position for me I do I go and and

509
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,130
go back to that or do I look for the

510
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:11,110
next thing and I decided that my skills

511
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:14,980
at this point not only on the managerial

512
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:19,539
side but also on technical side was kind

513
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:21,779
of no longer sock analyst level it was

514
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:24,789
typically sake analysts are generally

515
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:26,049
seeing unless you're like a senior stock

516
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:29,830
analyst or something that's generally

517
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:31,450
seen it's just an entry-level role so at

518
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,559
this point I was like I don't think I

519
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,279
meant relied on consider myself

520
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,990
entry-level anymore so and being that it

521
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:39,399
was a contractor role with decided that

522
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:43,919
I was going to go in something else

523
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:46,090
so I did a lot of did a lot of searching

524
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,830
applied to a lot of different places

525
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:53,230
and eventually it took a position as

526
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:56,320
director of assessments for rhino

527
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,880
security labs based in Seattle so if you

528
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,178
follow their blog post or anything you

529
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:04,059
know that Rhino security loves does a

530
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:05,529
lot with cloud security AWS security I

531
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:08,770
think recently they've been doing a lot

532
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:10,390
of stuff with container security so my

533
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:14,400
job was to essentially oversee the pin

534
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:17,679
chess team in the assessment team so

535
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,420
yeah if you're following my my chart you

536
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,899
later see that it was unemployed and

537
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,809
[Music]

538
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:28,299
afterwards after accepting this this

539
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:30,750
position and moving from you know the

540
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:33,990
East Coast all the way to Seattle II um

541
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:38,620
you know buying a house and relocating

542
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:44,230
it was uh I was pretty like good I was

543
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:47,408
like broccoli pretty fast and it kind of

544
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:50,380
you know shook my my core a little

545
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:53,350
bit because you know it was something

546
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:57,669
that I was somewhat expecting but not uh

547
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:59,678
but it really you know my my boss at the

548
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:01,929
time and myself we never really had a

549
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,620
discussion of performance and you know

550
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:08,470
that sort of thing so totally woke up

551
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,658
one morning checked my phone and then

552
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:13,750
saw like I'm letting you go and I was

553
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:16,480
like oh no I I wasn't prepared for this

554
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,250
um so if anyone's ever been fired or

555
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,080
laid off like it just kind of hurts and

556
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,669
you go you know this is the first time

557
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,939
that at Vista doe it had ever happened

558
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:26,470
to me and I was like oh man what do I do

559
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,909
you know for one it kind of bruise the

560
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,380
ego a little bit because I've done like

561
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:34,210
all these great amazing things but at

562
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:38,350
the same time I was like oh man you know

563
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:40,330
this sucks but at the same time felt it

564
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:41,830
felt a lot of anger like why is this

565
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,428
happening like I moved all the way out

566
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:49,539
here I took the position you know I I

567
00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:51,100
worked you know ridiculous hours to try

568
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:53,710
to make things happen and you know it

569
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,178
just felt through but also sadness and

570
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,649
then you know even lean in it a little

571
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:59,860
bit of depression because I'm just like

572
00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:01,510
oh no like you know this

573
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,520
you know kind of woe is me a little bit

574
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:07,379
we have the initial shock and on and

575
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,360
then afterwards after the dust settled

576
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,790
panic crept in and anxiety crept in like

577
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,159
oh no like I now have a mortgage payment

578
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,678
and how am I gonna pay my bills and how

579
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:21,220
how is me and I got married that I was

580
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,809
married alright and married so how how

581
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,570
am I gonna pay the bill is how are we

582
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:27,070
gonna survive essentially and cost of

583
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:32,559
living if you're from Seattle I've been

584
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:34,899
there like it's not cheap so it was from

585
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,000
this like kind of unemployed phase is

586
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:41,200
where like the rest of this talk kind of

587
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,290
takes over and this is where a lot of

588
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,380
lessons were learned you know in

589
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:53,110
hindsight so so the first thing I did

590
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:55,030
was you know get get get a it's like

591
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:57,840
it's get understand a situation that

592
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:00,160
you're operating in essentially so

593
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,159
there's a great website called cyber

594
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:06,160
seeks org and I think this is a quick

595
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,410
note I have like a slide and a half of

596
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,760
references of you know websites and

597
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,970
stuff to go check out and I'll post my

598
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,320
slides for you guys as well so so don't

599
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,110
feel like you have to like take notes

600
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,059
superfast or anything my slides on

601
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:21,428
Twitter tonight or tomorrow for you guys

602
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:25,059
to go check out and pull down and and

603
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:26,799
take a look at but there's a website

604
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:29,290
called cyber sea Gorga I think it's put

605
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:33,610
on by NIST or one of the federal

606
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:35,260
agencies or one a federal entity and it

607
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,360
essentially does like a snapshot of a

608
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,160
cybersecurity market at any given time

609
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,399
so what you're looking at on the screen

610
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:45,790
now is June 2019

611
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:50,590
you know snapshot of you know cyber seek

612
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:53,110
so at the time cyber seek was aware of

613
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:56,080
three hundred thirteen thousand you know

614
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:58,540
job openings and then they saw the total

615
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,879
you know seen a total force was seven

616
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,590
hundred fifteen thousand and again the

617
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,669
supply of cyber security workers is like

618
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:08,110
super low and then you see the top cyber

619
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:09,929
security job titles and there's a lot of

620
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:13,510
data that you can pull from this right

621
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:13,789
so you know read between the lines a

622
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,119
little

623
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:20,119
it I thought oh man like I'm not good

624
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:22,340
I've done like federal stuff I've done

625
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:23,988
military stuff I've done commercial

626
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,639
stuff and each and different entities in

627
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:28,479
each of those I should have no problem

628
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:32,299
on you know finding a job or whatever

629
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:34,460
but then moving trying to find a job

630
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:38,029
that I wanted I really in the job that I

631
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:40,879
wanted was pen tester or in that vein of

632
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:42,139
pen tester offensive security I really

633
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:44,299
didn't have a lot of hands-on experience

634
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:47,090
I had a lot of book knowledge I had the

635
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:48,979
certs I had the college degree I had the

636
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:52,939
you know experience on the military side

637
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:56,779
doing offensive stuff but not so much

638
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:59,359
doing commercial stuff so taking a look

639
00:28:56,779 --> 00:29:01,700
at a cyber see you know kind of doing it

640
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:03,199
aside if you're new to the to the

641
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,330
InfoSec world and you're trying to get

642
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,070
involved this is a great website to

643
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:10,249
check out because not only are you gonna

644
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:13,580
be able to get a somewhat under a

645
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:15,979
somewhat good snapshot of the

646
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:17,720
environment but you're also gonna be

647
00:29:15,979 --> 00:29:19,849
able to kind of take a look at these top

648
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,320
job titles a little bit and you can kind

649
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:23,299
of do some more research on it try to

650
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,239
figure you know see see which one did

651
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:27,679
you're interested in something I do when

652
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:31,399
people are trying to look for jobs and

653
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,590
such is I point them to these kind of

654
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:35,599
areas so that they can take a look at

655
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:37,309
and try to figure out you know what is

656
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:41,599
it that I want to do and we'll cover

657
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:44,899
more of that shortly thereafter so again

658
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:47,299
the msi career your career is so big

659
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:48,889
like how do you pick you've got digital

660
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:51,559
forensics you got threat hunter you've

661
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:53,090
got security orchestration and

662
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:55,190
automation

663
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,449
you know sore you got engineer if you

664
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,970
want to build things pentesters

665
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:03,220
consultants you get ICS systems SCADA

666
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:06,019
systems right so how do you pick well

667
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,059
you just kind of learn everything really

668
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:11,330
you know and this is most definitely

669
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:14,029
easier said than done but at this point

670
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,739
when you're trying to figure out you

671
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:17,269
know once you figure out the role that

672
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:18,919
you're wanting to go into and it can be

673
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:21,440
very broad it could be like I want to go

674
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,330
on the defensive security I want to go

675
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,580
into offensive security I want to go

676
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,918
into IT I want to go into networking

677
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,350
right

678
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:33,249
you know at that point you just you just

679
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:36,519
eliminated a bunch of many different

680
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:37,899
parts of the whole pie and kind of

681
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,480
narrowed your scope a little bit

682
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:45,158
so that you can kind of dig dig a little

683
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,840
bit deeper so being unemployed realizing

684
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:49,600
now that I wanted to go in offensive

685
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,668
security this is this is kind of where

686
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,109
my drive and determination sets in right

687
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:58,720
because the clock now starts right and

688
00:30:55,109 --> 00:31:00,129
being able to learn everything is again

689
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,919
easier said than done because most

690
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:04,689
people have jobs again I have a newborn

691
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:07,690
so I'm finding that a lot of the free

692
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:10,090
time I had before is no longer there but

693
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:11,769
being unemployed and only being married

694
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:16,359
and not having any kids at the time I

695
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:19,570
had a I'm alive free time now so through

696
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:21,249
my own experience I learned how to build

697
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,850
and secure things again but not break

698
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:27,489
them so so to narrow my scope even

699
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,719
further from offensive security I know I

700
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:31,529
want to go into security and in

701
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,029
offensive security I started focusing on

702
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:36,489
application security and really that was

703
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:38,590
for two reasons one I had never been

704
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:40,090
like a software engineer or developer

705
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,908
like a full stack or front-end or

706
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,830
back-end developer or you know in

707
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:46,570
working on a dev team building something

708
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,730
right using some of these you know

709
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:51,340
software development lifecycle it's like

710
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:53,980
agile or waterfall and my deaf skills

711
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:56,949
were like super lacking you know at this

712
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:59,559
point I had I had I had some ID and it

713
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:02,499
went immediately went into security so I

714
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:05,168
had some scripting I had some other type

715
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:08,529
of experience but really understanding

716
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:10,929
development at a at a level that

717
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:12,759
companies have development shops like I

718
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,159
just didn't have that and that's

719
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:18,759
something I wanted to learn and then

720
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:20,440
going into application security it was

721
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:22,210
just kind of like job security at this

722
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,830
point every just about every

723
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,489
organization has some type of

724
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:29,379
application and whether whether it be a

725
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:32,460
web app a mobile app or both and then it

726
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:36,279
typically if it's a mobile app it

727
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:39,519
probably is utilizing some web

728
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:40,360
technology like an API or something so

729
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,010
being able

730
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,809
speak to application security became

731
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:46,330
paramount and just about every single

732
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:48,670
role I applied for which is most

733
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:53,350
definitely kind of where i stunk to my

734
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:56,170
time even further issues AB set so in

735
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:58,000
order to kind of gain my knowledge um

736
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:00,309
I ordered the web app hacker's handbook

737
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,980
which is most definitely dated books do

738
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:05,530
get dated but there was still a lot of

739
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:07,750
good solid information in there that I

740
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:10,690
could pull from right even though it may

741
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:12,880
be dated they may be using may be using

742
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,650
an analysis of you know a programming

743
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,350
language that may be obsolete at this

744
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,880
point or is not very much in use but

745
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:21,280
it's pretty similar to what's the most

746
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,780
current version and then there's a lot

747
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,790
of tactics techniques and procedures

748
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:27,668
that's taught in this book that you can

749
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:32,040
you know it you can utilize and build

750
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:33,850
your own notes off off of and then

751
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,250
downloaded the free version of Burke

752
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:39,840
Burke is free I think the only

753
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:42,820
difference is between the free and the

754
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,610
paid version is that you don't get the

755
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:49,030
automatic scanning of applications and

756
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:51,490
stuff there's some perfect engines that

757
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:53,678
are only for the paid version and you

758
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:56,740
don't get Burke collaborator which isn't

759
00:33:53,679 --> 00:34:00,820
too hard to just spin up a digital ocean

760
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:06,130
or a web server that can accept incoming

761
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:08,168
calls so and then at the time ports

762
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:11,320
wigger also unveiled their web security

763
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:13,379
Academy which is another great great

764
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,540
great resource if you're trying to

765
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:19,210
understand application security concepts

766
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,560
like what is cores what is what is

767
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:24,520
cross-site scripting what a sequel

768
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:28,000
injection how can i how can I like use

769
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,859
and understand these vulnerabilities so

770
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,060
the website Academy isn't just like a

771
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,850
wiki post or anything

772
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:36,040
they actually have labs that you can run

773
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,929
through and again the only thing you

774
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,739
need is a browser and the free version

775
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:44,619
of burp and then another thing is bullet

776
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:48,178
hub boom has a lot of virtual beams that

777
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:52,570
are vulnerable that you can utilize to

778
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,990
so using so during a sign kind of work

779
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,520
through this piece

780
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:57,259
and started learning right and I was

781
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,750
starting to pick up dynamic testing

782
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,640
pretty quickly so how can I translate

783
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:03,770
that the future employers this is a

784
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,080
quick snapshot of like all the companies

785
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:09,290
I applied to and read you know means

786
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:12,860
either I didn't get a callback or I

787
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:14,180
didn't get you know I didn't either I

788
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,720
got a callback or if I did get a

789
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,649
callback

790
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,540
I didn't get to move forward with it so

791
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:22,040
but typically a lot of these positions I

792
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,890
get dropped into some poor old rock

793
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,240
environment I have is you know I have a

794
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,560
certain timeframe to find as many

795
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,669
vulnerabilities I could within the

796
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,869
environment and then have to write a

797
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:37,610
report on it so not only did I have to

798
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:40,310
learn new coding languages networks new

799
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:41,930
tools techniques procedures automation

800
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,130
and host defenses but I also had to be

801
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:47,029
able to write and make it look nice

802
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:49,250
which is a lie so but luckily for me I

803
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,869
had a lot of experience at programming

804
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,910
experience from college I had writing

805
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:55,130
it's you know styling a report writing

806
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:57,470
work from doing consulting as well as

807
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:59,960
colleges writing reports for college and

808
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:01,609
such and then defense thinking of

809
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,560
hardening the systems from my time as a

810
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:05,540
sysadmin and a stock analyst but also

811
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,700
offensive thinking from you know

812
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,840
actually leading a team of pen testers

813
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,379
on the commercial side and doing

814
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:14,990
offensive stuff on the federal side so

815
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:19,690
that is kind of my path to the dark side

816
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:23,890
so to speak and and then moving forward

817
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:27,050
eventually landed a role with a museum

818
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:29,629
which is a great company I love working

819
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:32,390
for these guys I work with people that

820
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,740
are consistently making me smarter that

821
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,900
are consistently challenging me and

822
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:39,279
pushing me to kind of learn more and one

823
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:42,080
in you know do more so that's the so

824
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,600
moving forward what is the key takeaways

825
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,869
from you know from this you know word

826
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,819
vomit but I've been doing it for a while

827
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:51,560
learn the basics like I can't emphasize

828
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,450
this enough a lot of people just want to

829
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,700
get to the sexy stuff the RCE

830
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:58,069
I want to pop the domain controller I

831
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:00,830
want rude on a server

832
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:03,410
I want admin on the app I want to be

833
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:05,660
able to do all these things but in in

834
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:07,379
order to be able to do those things you

835
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,240
have to understand

836
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,369
just basic networking you have to

837
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,919
understand basic coding you have to

838
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:17,480
understand how Windows environments work

839
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,400
how Linux environments work excuse me

840
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,750
you know so for networking understanding

841
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,920
network principles that are aligned with

842
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:28,470
CompTIA and net plus at CCNA again not

843
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,130
an advocate for like gonna go just go

844
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,720
get the sir

845
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:34,410
take the take multiple-choice test but

846
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,328
like use the certifications in their

847
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:38,910
course objectives as kind of like a road

848
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:41,309
map to your knowledge to learn right

849
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:43,049
they do a great job mapping it out to

850
00:37:41,309 --> 00:37:44,700
say you know breaking it down to the

851
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:46,950
topics and the bite-size pieces so you

852
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,359
can understand it coding if you're

853
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,700
trying to get into offensive security

854
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:53,130
like you you have to be able to code you

855
00:37:50,700 --> 00:38:00,029
have to be able to script and Python is

856
00:37:53,130 --> 00:38:02,670
typically your go-to for this and lately

857
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:04,740
once you kind of am I gonna say master

858
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,940
but once you you know feel like you got

859
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,950
a good grip on a programming language

860
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:11,250
try to do the same thing in a different

861
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:14,549
one understand how languages do certain

862
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:21,359
things and for me the next step was to

863
00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:23,369
go and to go which you know go is club

864
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,759
it's similar to Python but it does a lot

865
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:28,259
of things differently and sometimes one

866
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:29,549
programming language works better than

867
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:32,940
the other for whatever it is you're

868
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:34,619
trying to do and then windows like go

869
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,240
beyond basic usage like how do I change

870
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,859
my desktop and that sort of thing but

871
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,529
like learn about the underlying features

872
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:42,839
and how Windows does stuff and then

873
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:45,150
learn how to harden those Windows

874
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:47,759
environments right so Windows internals

875
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:50,250
if you are wanting to dig into Windows

876
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:53,420
environments Windows internals is your

877
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:56,730
bread and butter and Windows Microsoft

878
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:58,440
press has a book called Windows

879
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:01,769
internals I think it might be on its

880
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,500
seventh edition is pretty recent check

881
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:07,649
it out like it does way deep dive down

882
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,819
into it and then Linux like I feel like

883
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,259
everyone should be comfortable in a

884
00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:11,549
Linux environment you don't need to be

885
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:14,029
an expert in it but you should be able

886
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:16,079
to navigate around on the command line

887
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:19,049
you should be able to understand

888
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,029
services and processes and like maybe

889
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:23,699
write a shell script or two and

890
00:39:21,029 --> 00:39:26,249
just be familiar because a lot of the

891
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:27,989
work that I come into a lot of my

892
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:30,269
clients are building on top of Linux

893
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:32,999
servers some are using is and and

894
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:35,428
writing dotnet applications but the

895
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:39,269
majority of them are writing on Linux

896
00:39:35,429 --> 00:39:40,589
servers so my next thing would be like

897
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:42,149
find your thing right so it just kind of

898
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:46,319
goes back to like what do I go into

899
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:48,150
right so for for my kind of making this

900
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:49,890
a little bit easier do you like to build

901
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,509
things right if you like to build things

902
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:53,699
and you're looking for engineer or

903
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:55,169
developer in your title if you're trying

904
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:56,699
to figure out how things work you're

905
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:58,589
looking again you're kind of looking for

906
00:39:56,699 --> 00:40:01,169
engineers looking for analysts you're

907
00:39:58,589 --> 00:40:03,538
looking for threat hunter in your title

908
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:05,308
if you're trying to break things right

909
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:06,839
you're you're looking at pen testers

910
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:10,469
you're also looking at the runners again

911
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:16,349
um because in order to help defend your

912
00:40:10,469 --> 00:40:18,479
network and you know write indicators of

913
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:19,769
compromises and other things then you

914
00:40:18,479 --> 00:40:22,529
have to be able to understand it think

915
00:40:19,769 --> 00:40:25,078
like an adversary or red teamer right

916
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:26,429
and if you want to fix broken things and

917
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,819
that's an engineer position all day

918
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:34,859
right you know server falls over what

919
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:38,009
who do we call kind of deal so then um

920
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:39,598
so now kind of my advice is find a

921
00:40:38,009 --> 00:40:41,159
mentor I think throughout my career so

922
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,469
far I've got about six or seven

923
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:45,150
different mentors in like four of my

924
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:46,769
different fields um

925
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,539
you know I have some that's totally

926
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:51,689
specialized in blue team operations I

927
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:53,189
have some that specialize and store

928
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:54,899
operations I have some that specialize

929
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:56,428
in offensive security I'll sounded

930
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,809
specialized just in business they don't

931
00:40:56,429 --> 00:41:01,199
know anything on the security side but

932
00:40:57,809 --> 00:41:03,059
they know business pretty well so how do

933
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:03,869
you find a mentor Twitter's a solid

934
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:06,329
resource

935
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:09,569
don't underestimate cold emails right a

936
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:12,390
lot of the more well-known kind of

937
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:14,130
security people have may have like an

938
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:17,339
email account that you can like reach

939
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:18,839
out to meetups in your local area right

940
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:20,099
so download the meetup app and go check

941
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,828
it out there's a lot of good ones out

942
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:24,719
there conferences like this right and

943
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:26,189
then check for slack groups right if you

944
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,339
don't know what kind of slack group out

945
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:30,779
there you know you can easily do like a

946
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:33,839
slack group or a window slack group or

947
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:35,020
AWS like your mobile site group or Java

948
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,799
slag group like the

949
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:40,480
out there this guy to Google forum right

950
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,250
and then it kinda in the same vein a

951
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,530
finding a mentor like play my new

952
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:48,040
technology never underestimate the power

953
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:49,330
of a VM or a container right in and if

954
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,620
you don't know how to do something like

955
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:54,400
Google's your best friend Google is the

956
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:55,900
best sim so use it to find tutorials and

957
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,940
how to do stuff how do I create an

958
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,770
Apache server how do I create an engine

959
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:02,850
X server how do I create an Apache

960
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:06,340
server with an engine X reverse proxy

961
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:07,930
you know or look-look on github for open

962
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:11,500
source projects and and contribute right

963
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:13,270
you can pull down being able like

964
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,910
working and get is most definitely a

965
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:18,340
skill so being able to pull down some

966
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:20,710
you know being able to operate within a

967
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:25,300
git environment and understand like pull

968
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:28,830
push merge and what that means will will

969
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:32,110
most definitely give you some some more

970
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:34,000
credibility and then here's my secret

971
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:35,740
sauce right so my secret sauce is just

972
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,120
talk to everyone like don't be afraid to

973
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:41,439
approach people too many people in our

974
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:44,170
industry get that well that that person

975
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,340
knows way too much like like I'm just a

976
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:48,130
peon they're not going to want to talk

977
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:50,050
to me the vast majority of people in

978
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:51,640
this industry want to talk to you like

979
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:53,950
they love getting ask questions because

980
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,290
people like to talk about themselves and

981
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:58,330
people like to talk it just in general

982
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:00,820
right there's ask a question I guarantee

983
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:02,080
you and then generally look at it say if

984
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,180
you go to ask them a question and they

985
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,680
tell you you know you get they're kind

986
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,089
of rude or they brush you off or

987
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,140
whatever now it's probably not the

988
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:10,380
person that you want to talk to you

989
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,700
anyways right

990
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,740
get involved in your local community and

991
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,049
put sec right so showing it to be sides

992
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,970
is great I check out your local is a

993
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:21,940
chapter that's another great one if your

994
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:23,649
it's where you live has one and if it

995
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:26,070
doesn't have one didn't create one right

996
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:29,020
you don't need to be someone that is a

997
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:30,790
senior level executive that can create a

998
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:32,890
chapter anyone can create a chapter

999
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:34,840
anyone can create a no-loss chapter a

1000
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:38,049
meetup clearly just say hey guys we're

1001
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,120
gonna meet at XYZ at this time to talk

1002
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:42,040
about security if no one shows up Ron

1003
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,700
you reach get more people to come right

1004
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:47,410
I guarantee you people will come next

1005
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,490
one is like build a website and host a

1006
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,960
blog where you can

1007
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:52,209
put your put whatever you're learning

1008
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,670
right and also like don't go to wigs

1009
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:56,440
like wicks is a you know not doubting

1010
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:58,480
not putting wicks or not putting down

1011
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,730
any websites like glitz or whatever but

1012
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,119
you're gonna gain so much more if you

1013
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:06,430
create like a droplet or a virtual

1014
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:10,119
machine on Azure or an ec2 essence on

1015
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:12,580
AWS and then build off of that you're

1016
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:13,990
just gonna get so much from it and then

1017
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,759
believe again be fluent in the

1018
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:17,379
fundamentals knowledge is greater than

1019
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,390
search so when I'm looking at when I was

1020
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,339
looking to hire people I cared more

1021
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,259
about what could you show me than what

1022
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:24,759
was on paper what did you know right and

1023
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,560
I had questions I would ask to kind of

1024
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,810
gauge your knowledge and how deep you

1025
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,520
could go they mentioned it in the

1026
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:32,470
previous slide but certs are the

1027
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,770
previous talk the search gets you to an

1028
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:37,569
extinct to a point you know search might

1029
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:39,190
get you pass HR or whatever but then

1030
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,540
once you like really start talking to

1031
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:42,880
people who know what they're talking

1032
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:45,130
about um you know you're not going to be

1033
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,839
able to to lie right you're not gonna be

1034
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:49,540
able to like fluff it and fluff the

1035
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:51,160
answers right so I cared more about

1036
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:53,470
getting the job done can you get the job

1037
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,759
funded I need you to get done and then

1038
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,310
do stuff I think I mentioned just in

1039
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,750
discord but like CTS competitions tech

1040
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:01,599
projects personal and part of a team

1041
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:03,880
right so look at joining a CTF game

1042
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,020
right look at hosting I seek EFT and

1043
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,000
trying to get people to come join you

1044
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:09,580
right yeah there's a lot of lessons

1045
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,130
learned and power in groups when in in

1046
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:15,640
regards to learning and it lastly was

1047
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,599
kind of create your own brand so this is

1048
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,490
kind of like just for your own

1049
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:21,970
professional development I

1050
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:25,779
every time I do a talk I have slides

1051
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:28,029
that I have slides that look a certain

1052
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:30,730
way that kind of have my feel my touch

1053
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:33,400
my fingerprints all over it you know

1054
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:34,540
when I hand out business cards you know

1055
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,190
they just have my own personal

1056
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:39,009
information on it when I'm not working

1057
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:41,859
with people you know it has my own Flair

1058
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:43,900
on it something that says me right so

1059
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:45,520
but brand is not only just marketing

1060
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,869
materials it's also like what do you

1061
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,880
stand for what are your ethics what are

1062
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:55,020
your values those are they so I guess

1063
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,030
that was kind of the end of my talk so

1064
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:02,410
at this point I would ask questions but

1065
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:05,710
I think I'm over on my time a little bit

1066
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:06,609
