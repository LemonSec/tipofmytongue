my name is dr gregorios fragos

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,560
and as known by most of you greg

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,119
and i am responsible for organizing a

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,279
besides approved community-based

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,439
information security conference

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,320
in athens greece along with an amazing

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,560
team of volunteers

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,600
we started in 2016 and since then we

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,880
have had about 150 talks and workshops

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,920
70 speakers from all over the world both

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,520
greeks and non-greeks

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,800
and a truly awesome lineup of sponsors

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,039
we were hoping this year to be able to

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,760
go back to a physical in-person event

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,440
which we will really have enjoyed

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,920
putting together the previous years

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,719
but due to the circumstances we had to

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,440
adjust

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,079
and adapt once more in order to move

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,280
forward

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,920
you see sometimes you need to embrace

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,519
plot twists

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,799
and try make the most you can despite

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,159
the circumstances

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,159
especially for those of us who truly

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,760
believe we could

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
and can make it happen apparently

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,000
putting together a live stream event has

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,040
several

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
challenges i would say which we could

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,280
not foresee

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,320
however despite those challenges

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,439
and circumstances at different levels

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,759
we really hope we manage to put together

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,600
an enjoyable day for you

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,720

around a little bit

441
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,399

beware of the greeks

443
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,600
