00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:04,720
hi

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,560
i'm josephine winslows and today i'm

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,320
going to teach you how you can save

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,000
lives with a smartphone

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,519
pretty ambitious but if you stick with

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,080
me i'll walk you through it step by step

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,839
my background is in building medical

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,560
devices and medical device software

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,000
in my free time i'm trying to teach

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,240
myself cyber security

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,080
one of the very first things that i

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,599
learned and something that you guys

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,519
are probably more familiar with than i

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,080
am is that the first step in finding

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,040
a solution is understanding the threat

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,559
so what's the threat here what are we

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,440
saving lives

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,559
from neonatal jaundice

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,480
this is a medical term with two main

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,920
parts neonatal

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,000
meaning affecting infants or newborn

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,039
babies and

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,920
jaundice jaundice is a term used to

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,320
describe a yellowing of the skin

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,160
and the sclera that's the whites of the

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,079
eyes it's caused by a buildup of

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,399
bilirubin which is a yellow orange bile

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,120
pigment

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,680
produced when your body gets rid of red

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,960
blood cells

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,440
now usually bilirubin is not a big deal

32
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,000
it's

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,519
filtered out from your body like any

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,520
other waste product it's when this

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
delicate balance is disrupted that

36
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,040
issues start to arise

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,159
there are a couple of different ways

38
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,159
this can happen but the important thing

39
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,080
is that as bilirubin builds up in your

40
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,000
bloodstream it causes

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,280
abdominal pain fever weakness fatigue

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,360
and at really high levels it can pass

43
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
through the blood brain barrier

44
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,560
causing permanent disability or death

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,759
this is a massive issue and

46
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,880
it's a global health crisis neonatal

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
jaundice affects up to eighty percent of

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,520
premature births and up to sixty percent

49
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,000
of full

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,520
term births it can be fatal and

51
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,560
although it's difficult to prevent it

52
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,119
is quite easy to cure if it's diagnosed

53
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,159
early enough

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,560
in less severe cases it can be treated

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
with exposure to uv

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
light which is phototherapy and oxygen

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
and in more severe cases an exchange

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,840
transfusion can be used

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,360
if it can be treated then why is it

60
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,680
still causing 114

61
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
000 infant deaths every year to

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,160
understand this we have to look at where

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,920
those deaths are happening

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,680
three-quarters of them occur in

65
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,120
sub-saharan africa

66
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120
and south asia and there's a number of

67
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,720
different reasons which contribute to

68
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,360
this

69
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
including an increased likelihood of

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,040
certain genetic risk factors

71
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,480
like a g6pd deficiency and a lack of

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,760
access to healthcare

73
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
that the leading cause is the difficulty

74
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,519
of diagnosing jaundice

75
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,599
using traditional methods like visual

76
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,920
inspection in infants with darker skin

77
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,720
tones

78
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,120
it's just much more difficult to detect

79
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,720
a yellowing of the skin

80
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
in infants with a darker skin tone and

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,760
that's the current standard practice

82
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,319
the need for a reliable low-cost

83
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,519
screening solution

84
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,280
which is accurate regardless of skin

85
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,879
tone is clear

86
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,000
so what are our options in the uk

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,080
an infant who is suspected of having

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
neonatal jaundice

89
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,080
can be given a blood test to determine

90
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
the exact levels of bilirubin in their

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
bloodstream

92
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
this is the gold standard diagnostic

93
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,720
technique and

94
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
although it's very accurate it's simply

95
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,159
not a feasible option for

96
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,879
many infants in countries where there's

97
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,400
difficulty in accessing

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,120
the expensive and bulky medical

99
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
equipment that's needed to perform this

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,319
kind of testing

101
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,560
it is also an invasive procedure which

102
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,400
can be really difficult for parents of

103
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,440
newborns

104
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,840
as it involves drawing blood the other

105
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,040
methods i've already talked about

106
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
looking at the skin tone and the sclera

107
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,640
that's marked on this image the white of

108
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,319
the eye

109
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,360
what we need is a solution that is

110
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,400
non-invasive

111
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
and cost-effective a method that's being

112
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,000
tried in the uk is color imagery

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,920
that's using these big expensive pieces

114
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,879
of equipment i call colorimetry machines

115
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,720
they measure the color of a surface by

116
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
looking at the rate of absorption

117
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,439
of different wavelengths of light i got

118
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,720
to play with some of these in my second

119
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
year of university and i got involved in

120
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,599
a project

121
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,239
which was looking at recreating this

122
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,280
effect using dslr cameras

123
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,640
you take a picture with the camera

124
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,720
export it to a computer and then use a

125
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,480
programmer in matlab to do analysis

126
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,478
i was debating back and forth with my

127
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,759
professor and i said

128
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,199
surely this could all be done on a

129
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,759
smartphone and he said

130
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
no that's impossible so of course i did

131
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,199
what

132
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,360
anyone else would have done and i spent

133
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,199
the next three years of my life proving

134
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,759
him wrong

135
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,880
we designed an app a smartphone app

136
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,800
which would allow us to complete this

137
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,479
colorimetry procedure

138
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,080
luckily this was possible thanks to the

139
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,840
rapid advance in technology over the

140
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,880
last few years

141
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,400
not only in the sensitivity of

142
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,320
smartphone cameras but also in the

143
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,919
processing power that it requires to

144
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,400
perform analysis like this

145
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,560
we created an app that uses two images

146
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
of the whites of the eye to screen for

147
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,160
neonatal jaundice

148
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,919
two things to focus on here firstly the

149
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,440
whites of the eye that's because this is

150
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,120
a pretty consistent color

151
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,919
across infants of all skin tones and

152
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:04,720
secondly

153
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,520
two images we use a flash and none flash

154
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,160
pair

155
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
this is basically done to remove ambient

156
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
lighting from the equation

157
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
when you take an image with flash and

158
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
then an image with no flash you can

159
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
subtract one from the other

160
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
and are left with a composite image

161
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,280
which only takes into account the light

162
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,120
that was emitted from the flash

163
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,360
excluding all ambient lighting which is

164
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
important because yellow light makes the

165
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,560
image look more yellow

166
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,199
and blue light does the same for blue

167
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,919
and we want

168
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,080
a really accurate reading of what the

169
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,520
actual color of the eye

170
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
is it's really important for an accurate

171
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,840
diagnosis

172
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,280
quick moment to shout out the

173
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,039
organizations that supported me

174
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,280
in this project it was a collaborative

175
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,080
effort

176
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,039
across all of these organizations and

177
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,720
these charities who are really really

178
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,039
fantastic in supplying financial

179
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,000
support to the organizations that have

180
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
assisted

181
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,720
in the saving lives of birth project

182
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,120
i started this app with a proof of

183
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,440
concept that i built over at two months

184
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,639
in the summer of my second year of

185
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,680
university

186
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
it was really ambitious i built a very

187
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
customizable app

188
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,840
which was designed to be adaptable to

189
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,520
the needs of the user

190
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,759
once i'd proved it i had to go back to

191
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,639
the drawing board

192
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,479
i spoke to these wonderful wonderful

193
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,759
doctors dr

194
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,560
christophel and dr judith who are both

195
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,240
paediatric consultants

196
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,800
dr crystal in akron hospital in ghana

197
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,759
and dr judith

198
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,280
at the university college london

199
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,800
hospital

200
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,280
we sat down and we talked not only to

201
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,120
them but also to midwives and the

202
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,720
neonatal care teams

203
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,880
we asked them what they needed out of

204
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
this app this is called user driven

205
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,840
development

206
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,800
instead of me assuming their needs i ask

207
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,080
them directly

208
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
i gave them my prototype and they came

209
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,599
back and they had a whole bunch of

210
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,360
requests which was so wonderful

211
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,599
they said we love how customizable it is

212
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,280
but that's not what's important to us

213
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,919
we need it to be simple we're already

214
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,680
dealing with a baby

215
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,199
which can be difficult at the best of

216
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,599
times this app needs to be intuitive

217
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,639
not take up too much of our brain space

218
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,160
we need to be focused on the patient

219
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,400
here we also want you to

220
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
remove all of the sounds you've put in

221
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,759
they're really disruptive it was tips

222
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,000
like

223
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
this that really helped make the app so

224
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
much better

225
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,960
in the end we settled on design with

226
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
four stages

227
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
uh using the two main principles that

228
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,080
they have prioritized

229
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
intuitive design and minimal use of

230
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
language they don't want to read lots of

231
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,120
stuff and also

232
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
this app will hopefully go out to a

233
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,400
wider reach

234
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,319
where crossing language barriers and we

235
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,039
want to make it accessible

236
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,120
the first stage is just a full screen

237
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,400
camera showing you

238
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,720
as much of the image as possible so that

239
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,960
you can focus on getting a clear shot of

240
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,720
the white of the eye

241
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,319
there is a camera capture button a

242
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,840
little counter to show you how many

243
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,680
pairs of images you've taken

244
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,440
and when you finish taking enough images

245
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,360
we recommend five pairs

246
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,199
and then you just press the tick button

247
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,960
to show that you're done

248
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
here's what that looks like in real life

249
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
on a prototype version

250
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,759
the next stage it shows you a pair of

251
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,840
images that you have already captured

252
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,440
one above the other the flash and the

253
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,280
non-flash images

254
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,560
which is a little bit difficult you can

255
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,400
see it better here in this image of the

256
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
app in use

257
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
and because it's very difficult to

258
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,599
capture an image that is entirely taken

259
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,120
up with the white of the eye as i said

260
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,919
babies tend to move about quite a bit

261
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,720
you can then

262
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
zoom in and pan using quite intuitive

263
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,919
pinch to zoom and scroll to pan

264
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,919
methods that allows you to get the

265
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,958
sample area

266
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,958
that's this little yellow square in the

267
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,640
middle of each image

268
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,159
over the area of the eye that is

269
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,559
entirely covered by just the sclera just

270
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,440
the white

271
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
avoiding any veins or shadows or the

272
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
eyelid and making sure you can get a

273
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,959
good sample out of the image

274
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,480
this is larry is actually all we're

275
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,760
going to be looking at in order to

276
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,480
determine

277
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,800
the colour imagery of that white of the

278
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,040
eye

279
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
this allows you not only to check that

280
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,720
the image quality is good and that you

281
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
can get a good sample

282
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,040
if you can't hit that delete button but

283
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,839
it also

284
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
lets you control the image after you've

285
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
taken it and focus on getting a good

286
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,240
image

287
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
without worrying about making sure

288
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,839
there's no eyelid in it

289
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,200
in the initial stages this

290
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,640
is just showing what that looks like the

291
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,000
little area you want to be focusing in

292
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,480
on here

293
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
is the sclera

294
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,240
once you've done that then you just

295
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,920
press next and we get some results we

296
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
average out a couple of different images

297
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
because this is science this is

298
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,240
diagnostics and we need the most

299
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,480
accurate reading we can

300
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,880
it will show you the scb that is your

301
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,839
projected

302
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,000
bilirubin levels based on the results

303
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,519
what we think that means and then a

304
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,640
confidence rating

305
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
because we want the healthcare

306
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,000
professionals to feel confident in what

307
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
the app is telling them

308
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,880
if we think it's on the edge we'll tell

309
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
you that and you can monitor the patient

310
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,519
carefully

311
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,360
but if we think it's definitely jaundice

312
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,160
then we'll recommend immediate action

313
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,760
after this since this is a research

314
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,440
project we have the advanced results

315
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,080
screen

316
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,079
that means that we can feedback more

317
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,120
intense data

318
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
straight back to the team for continual

319
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,399
improvement

320
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,920
this app is based on the camera 2 api we

321
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,279
decided to do it in android

322
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,360
because it gives us much more control

323
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,760
over the camera itself

324
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,040
an api is just a programming interface

325
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,880
it's a bunch of different modules a

326
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
framework that allows you

327
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,000
to build your own apps the camera 2 api

328
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
is one of the most advanced

329
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,640
in terms of the level of control it

330
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,800
gives you but it wasn't advanced

331
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
enough we needed to build a custom

332
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,519
camera capture session module

333
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,399
and that's because to understand that

334
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,440
you need to understand the internal

335
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,560
workings of a camera

336
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,399
this is a bayer matrix it's what the

337
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,079
inside of your camera looks like

338
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,000
it's a scientific approximation which is

339
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,360
nearly as cool

340
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,920
it's a series of light sensors red green

341
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,600
and blue with more green because your

342
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,839
eye is the most sensitive to that

343
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,000
and these light sensors come together to

344
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,760
form pixels four of them in a pixel

345
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,279
reason this is important is because you

346
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,040
can't access individual light sensors

347
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,560
using the camera 2 api

348
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,800
so we had to build a custom module which

349
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,959
would allow us to get data directly from

350
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,000
these sensors

351
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,839
rather than an averaged out version

352
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,519
which compensated already for white

353
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,480
balance

354
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,720
and other factors we needed the actual

355
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
data to get the most

356
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
accurate reading we don't care about the

357
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,920
image looking good

358
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,600
we just need to understand it from a

359
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,279
scientific point of view

360
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,519
this involved getting the raw image data

361
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,120
something that is not standardized

362
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,640
across different cameras

363
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,320
and not standard across different phone

364
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,839
models either and

365
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,680
transforming that into an image file

366
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
that we could read

367
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,360
to do this we used a custom raw image to

368
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,399
dng

369
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,399
file conversion this is something that's

370
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,680
still under development

371
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,040
currently it only works for a few

372
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,279
specific brands of phone

373
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,880
but because they have to hard code

374
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,399
certain values

375
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,279
into the software to compensate for

376
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,240
things like different

377
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,560
color filter arrangements orientation

378
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
masked pixels as well as a lot of

379
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
different other characteristics

380
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,720
once we've got this into a tagged image

381
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,360
file format tiff or dng

382
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,480
then we can move on to sampling

383
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,519
this is a rough understanding of how the

384
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,440
app is laid out in terms of the modules

385
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,000
used

386
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
as you can see there is a large section

387
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,399
dedicated to this raw analysis that's

388
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,279
the green

389
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,320
and the blue sections it's a custom

390
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,079
micro services architecture which is

391
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,000
just a fancy website we built the app

392
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
in a way that is highly maintainable and

393
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,040
really testable

394
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,600
it uses a main activity and then hosts

395
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
different fragments within that

396
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,839
to perform the different features of the

397
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,040
app once we built the app

398
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,320
we needed to calibrate it as i mentioned

399
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,760
each camera is going to be slightly

400
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,440
different but also the flash is slightly

401
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
different on each modular phone

402
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,519
some are yellower some are more white

403
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,000
and they vary in brightness as well

404
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
so we needed to calibrate to a known

405
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,680
color and these swatches are what we use

406
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,720
to do that

407
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,800
we take images of colors where we know

408
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,320
the exact color value

409
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,160
under a range of different conditions

410
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,440
and then we look at the output we're

411
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,959
getting from the app

412
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,040
and we calibrate it against the known

413
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,760
color values of these swatches

414
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,360
this is another hold up at the moment

415
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
because it means the app can't just be

416
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,639
deployed you can't just download it and

417
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,440
go

418
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
the it needs to be calibrated for the

419
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,360
specific phone that you're using

420
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,120
and this really needs to be done in the

421
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,079
lab conditions

422
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
again something we're working on and

423
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,600
hopefully in future iterations

424
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,480
of this project this can be avoided and

425
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
we can find a way to calibrate it

426
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,519
remotely for the phone

427
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,360
or using an easier procedure because

428
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,480
these color swatches are really

429
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,200
difficult

430
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,959
to get hold of and really difficult to

431
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,639
maintain

432
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,600
they're very very sensitive something

433
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,639
else to consider is

434
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,040
security now as you can probably tell

435
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,720
due to this slide coming quite so late

436
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,839
in the presentation

437
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,160
security wasn't baked into this project

438
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,760
from the beginning

439
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,880
unfortunately i'm a developer

440
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,720
and the rest of you work on the project

441
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
as scientists

442
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
we didn't have much experience with

443
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
security

444
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,440
to give you some background this app is

445
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,800
designed used by healthcare workers

446
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,279
working in really remote locations

447
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,120
who don't have access to reliable

448
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
internet and may not be able to download

449
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,360
the latest firmware updates

450
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,279
for their phones leaving them really

451
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,440
vulnerable in earlier iterations we were

452
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,000
sending

453
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,440
really sensitive data completely

454
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,079
unencrypted over the internet

455
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,839
this is not ideal it's not just a

456
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,199
theoretical problem there have been

457
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,199
several cases recently where m health

458
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:29,760
apps

459
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,519
have been targeted by malicious actors

460
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,120
because it's a really vulnerable

461
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,959
situation you're in when you're dealing

462
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,519
with health data

463
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,199
and not just because we want to protect

464
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,880
people this is a medical device and

465
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,800
there are legal requirements

466
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
surrounding medical devices and cyber

467
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,880
security

468
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,279
in order for the device to pass through

469
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,720
these legislatures and

470
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,120
be available on the market we need to

471
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,199
come up with a way of making the data

472
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,800
secure currently our data transfer

473
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,839
solution

474
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,160
is just not doing it over the internet

475
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,480
we keep everything completely manual

476
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
on the phones and keep them offline to

477
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
try and secure them as best

478
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
we can this isn't ideal our other

479
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,079
solution is to ask for help

480
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,639
uh if you or someone you know are

481
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,279
interested

482
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,399
in security and phone applications or

483
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,320
ideally any health security

484
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,240
we would absolutely love to hear from

485
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,160
you please get in touch my details are

486
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,519
going to be available at the end of the

487
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,839
presentation

488
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,759
the next stage is field testing and

489
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,279
we're really really excited

490
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,800
so far we have two field testing

491
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,399
locations one in the uk

492
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,519
and one in accra in ghana 504 babies

493
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,800
have already been surveyed

494
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,199
in acro general hospital in the hospital

495
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,720
so that we can verify these results

496
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,279
against that gold standard blood test

497
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,120
the next step is going to be expanding

498
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,399
to different locations

499
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,000
getting more people involved in the

500
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
project and hopefully

501
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,279
saving some lives if you have any

502
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,040
questions feel free to reach out to me

503
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
on twitter or you can find me on

504
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,079
linkedin

505
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,800
i look forward to getting more involved

506
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
in cyber security in the future

507
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,519
and i really hope you've enjoyed the

508
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,360
presentation today thank you so much for

509
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,079
listening
