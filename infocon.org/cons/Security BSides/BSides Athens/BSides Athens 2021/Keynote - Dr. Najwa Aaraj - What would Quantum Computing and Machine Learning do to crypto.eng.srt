1
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,519
so hello everyone

2
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,400
my name is i'm the chief researcher of

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,480
the cryptography research center at the

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,880
technology innovation institute in abu

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,440
dhabi the united arab emirates

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,480
i'm also heading on an acting basis the

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
autonomous robotics center

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,760
at research center at the institute

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,440
i would like to thank greg and the

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,800
organizing committee

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,440
for having me here today my talk would

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:47,920
be

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,039
on the impact of quantum computers and

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
machine learning on cryptography and

15
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,600
cryptographic systems

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,920
maybe this topic is not mainstream for

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,320
b-sides so i do hope that

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,239
um that you enjoy the presentation

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,640
so as i said the talk today is about

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,880
what would quantum computers and machine

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,920
learning do to

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,240
cryptography and cryptographic systems

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,439
i guess all of you are familiar with

24
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,759
the concept of cryptography which you

25
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,680
know to put it simply it's a set of

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
mathematical algorithms

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,360
or operations that are conducted on

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,000
plain text between two parties

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,159
in order to ensure confidentiality

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,119
integrity

31
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,439
and authentication of data and providing

32
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,720
other properties like

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,759
non-repudiation for example

34
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,920
there are two types of cryptographic

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
systems we have the

36
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,880
symmetric cryptography systems where the

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,799
sender and the recipient are basically

38
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
the two involved parties they share a

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,439
secret key either through pre-sharing it

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,759
or establishing it through

41
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,600
an algorithms like diffie-hellman for

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,880
example

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,439
then the data is encrypted and decrypted

44
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,560
using this

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,920
shared secret key and we also have the

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,799
asymmetric

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,640
crypto or what we know today as the

48
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,639
public key cryptography

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,680
where each of the and the parties

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
what we call here alice and bob each one

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,959
of them has

52
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,560
a pair of a public key and a private key

53
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,879
so whenever i want to send an encrypted

54
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,720
information to the recipient

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,440
i use the public key of that recipient

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
to encrypt the data

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,640
and that recipient obviously after

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,640
authenticating him or her

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,120
and that recipient being the only holder

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,519
of the private key would be able to

61
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,879
decrypt the information

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,720
you're familiar with the the the

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,800
components of what what we call today

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,879
the ensemble of algorithms that we call

65
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,000
the symmetric crypto

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
so we have block ciphers all of you know

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,360
about aes

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,080
we have macs we have hash functions so

69
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,200
the random number generators

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,920
key derivation functions or kdf stream

71
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
ciphers authenticated encryption and

72
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,000
memory heart functions

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,440
um you're all familiar with rsa and ecc

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,200
which are classified under the

75
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,280
asymmetric cryptography

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,159
cryptographic systems and the concepts

77
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,480
of

78
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,040
key exchange which we do using

79
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,840
diffie-hellman or isidifi helman

80
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
and also with the concept of digital

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,440
signatures dsa

82
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,720
or ecdsa and the same way we have

83
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,680
cryptography

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,920
the design and the implementation and

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,159
the security analysis of cryptographic

86
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,200
systems

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,680
we also have what we call the

88
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,040
cryptanalysis we have the

89
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
theoretical cryptanalysis and the

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,799
algorithmic attacks

91
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,760
like the chosen plaintext attack where

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
basically the attacker

93
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
sends his own plaintext to the oracle

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,720
and then

95
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
receives the cipher text back and then

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,319
we also have the

97
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,920
chosen ciphertext attacks we have

98
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,400
a cryptanalytic attacks against

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,959
implementations of cryptographic systems

100
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,439
and

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,439
the most common ones are side channel

102
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,640
analysis

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,360
so either timing attacks cache attacks

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,480
memory attacks

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,599
we also have power attacks both simple

106
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,519
and differential power attacks em

107
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,120
attacks also both simple and

108
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,918
differential

109
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,519
iem attacks and others and also we have

110
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
fault injection attacks so these are the

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,720
attacks

112
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,639
or the cryptanalytic attacks that we

113
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,479
know today

114
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,800
in the classical sense or the or the

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,720
conventional sense

116
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,440
and today we have another threat to

117
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,000
cryptography which is basically the

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,520
quantum computers so

119
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,320
focusing on asymmetric cryptography both

120
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,759
rsa and scc

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,680
they are based on mathematically hard

122
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,800
problems

123
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,280
where even the most powerful computers

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,520
and supercomputers that we have today

125
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,560
would take

126
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,520
years and centuries in order to be able

127
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,240
to

128
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,520
break those mathematical problems so rsa

129
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,080
relies

130
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,080
on integer factorization or prime

131
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,639
factorization

132
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,360
and the heart problem on which ecc or

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
elliptic curve cryptography realize

134
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,840
today

135
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,960
is discrete logarithms so as i said

136
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,840
today the most powerful supercomputers

137
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,080
cannot unravel the puzzle around these

138
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,120
two

139
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,919
heart problems however with the advent

140
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,880
of

141
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,280
quantum computers and quantum computers

142
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,919
as a reality we hear you know about

143
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,080
breakthroughs every day regardless of

144
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
the technology whether it is a

145
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,840
superconducting technology whether it is

146
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,000
an ion trapping technology etc they're

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,039
becoming a

148
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,160
reality and i guess most of you would

149
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,000
have heard

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,440
especially as of late 2019

151
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
about quantum supremacy and the

152
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,919
potential ability of quantum computers

153
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,479
to solve

154
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,560
problems that classical and conventional

155
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,039
computers practically cannot

156
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,000
solve and from a crypto sense i know two

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,280
quantum algorithms

158
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
we have the shores polynomial time

159
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,199
quantum algorithm which

160
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,000
factors into with can factor integers

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,400
and

162
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,440
compute discrete logarithms efficiently

163
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
so what this means based on what i said

164
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,639
before

165
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,600
because we have this polynomial time

166
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
quantum algorithms the security of

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,199
public key cryptographic algorithms

168
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,160
basically is

169
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,600
gone to zero so it's is broken and we

170
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
have grover algorithm or what we call

171
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,880
grover search

172
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,319
which can be used today um

173
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,560
which basically reduces the security

174
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,440
level of symmetric algorithms by half

175
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,039
recent studies said that uh basically

176
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,160
for for for encountering the threat the

177
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,479
key size of symmetric crypto algorithms

178
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,840
would go by

179
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,599
70 900 not 100 percent but in any case

180
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,440
what i'm trying to say here is that the

181
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
symmetric algorithms are impacted

182
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
because of global search

183
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,720
it's not as much of a priority as as

184
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,800
it is for public key crypto but still

185
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,560
there is an impact through this

186
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,479
quantum algorithm so

187
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,160
given this there are differing point of

188
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,960
views

189
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,840
on how to prevent the threat of quantum

190
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,960
computers

191
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
um against public key cryptosystems

192
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,080
so as you can imagine the physicists

193
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
would say use quantum technologies to

194
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,919
fight quantum technologies

195
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,400
in other sense use what we call today

196
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,960
the quantum key distribution systems

197
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,080
in order to fight the threat of quantum

198
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,400
computers to cryptographic systems and

199
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,960
this is what we call today the

200
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
quantum cryptography field and

201
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,720
cryptography

202
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
cryptographers say base your crypto on

203
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,599
math or mathematical problems hard

204
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,759
problems that quantum computers cannot

205
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,479
break

206
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,720
and this is the whole concept behind

207
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,240
quantum resistant or

208
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,680
quantum post-quantum cryptography

209
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,160
so post-quantum cryptography basically

210
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
it consists of algorithms that run

211
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,560
efficiently on classical computers but

212
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,680
are hard to break even with

213
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,000
quantum computers so in other sense

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,960
these are different

215
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,120
they use different mathematical problems

216
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
than integer factorization

217
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,039
or discrete logarithms so

218
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,319
there is obviously a need to

219
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,800
revamp or revise the standard for public

220
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,479
key cryptography

221
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,000
in other words we need new post quantum

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,279
algorithms

223
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,760
um and in early 2016 nest announced a

224
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,679
plan to select and standardize

225
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,799
post quantum algorithms for

226
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,560
public key encryption for key

227
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,399
establishment or what we call in the

228
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,399
post quantum world key encapsulation

229
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,600
mechanisms

230
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,399
and for digital signatures the deadline

231
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,080
of submissions was in november

232
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,440
2017 and the competition is still

233
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,360
ongoing is that it's round

234
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,959
three finalists have been announced and

235
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,360
most likely and actually i think it's a

236
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,560
fact that the

237
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,399
there is a fourth round and a call

238
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,160
especially that's happening most likely

239
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,640
towards the end of this year

240
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,200
for candidates especially for digital

241
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,839
signatures

242
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,320
so basically these are the updates as of

243
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,480
as of last year 22nd of july

244
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
uh you can see that there are multiple

245
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,680
candidates for post quantum cryptography

246
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
both on the public key encryption key

247
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,080
encapsulation and signatures

248
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,320
there are multiple hard problems based

249
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,240
on which post quantum algorithms

250
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
are based without going into too much

251
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
detail we have what we call today the

252
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,240
lattice-based

253
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,320
cryptography usually there are strong

254
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,640
candidates for encryption signatures

255
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,080
and key encapsulation or key exchange

256
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,880
they are based on what we call the sis

257
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,360
and the lwe problems these are the hard

258
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,640
problems based on which

259
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
they are based so basically they are the

260
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,240
shortest integer solution

261
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,720
and the learning with other learning

262
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,560
with errors problems

263
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,440
we also have a code based cryptography

264
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,240
which is based on coding theory

265
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,600
still secure parameters um for

266
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,320
uh there are still secure parameters for

267
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,640
macales crypto system and this is quite

268
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,120
an old crypto system that was

269
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,440
uh suggested in the 1970s 1978

270
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,160
they have the key size is large so they

271
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,560
have bigger keys and they are attractive

272
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,680
mainly for encryption we also

273
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,079
have a post quantum cryptographic

274
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:42,800
schemes that

275
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,600
are these are the multivariate

276
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,079
polynomial cryptographic schemes

277
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,480
and they are based on solving systems of

278
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,519
multivariate polynomials

279
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,279
i guess multiple schemes that have been

280
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,800
proposed have been broken

281
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,160
but signatures based on

282
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,320
multivariate polynomials still have some

283
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,240
potential

284
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,480
we have also post quantum schemes that

285
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
are based on

286
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
symmetric primitives and in particular

287
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,959
hash functions so

288
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,640
you know because they are based on hash

289
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,880
functions their post quantum security is

290
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,560
quite well understood

291
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,800
and this is where i quote basically i

292
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,040
mentioned the hash based signatures

293
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,600
and also we have cryptographic schemes i

294
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,440
think here i bundled it under others

295
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,040
which is the isogeny

296
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,760
it uses isogenes or it uses basically

297
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,880
based on

298
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,959
isogeny problem of super singular curves

299
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,920
basically there were few proposals for

300
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,440
key exchange

301
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,680
it's an isogenic diffie-hellman 4k

302
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,959
exchange

303
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,399
it was proposed there's the key sizes

304
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,279
are smaller

305
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,000
but we still have performance issues for

306
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,079
those cryptosystems and maybe this is

307
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,600
why you see them selected as

308
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
alternative here so to sum it up

309
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,240
we have there are finalists across

310
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,160
all these um all the schemes lattices

311
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,040
codes multivariates hash based

312
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,240
signatures

313
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,800
there are few that were that were

314
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,279
selected across all of them as finalists

315
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,200
and the post quantum

316
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,160
competition and there are also few that

317
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,120
were

318
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,360
selected either as finalists or

319
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
alternates candidates

320
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,320
for key encapsulation mechanisms and

321
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,600
mechanism and public key encryption so

322
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,000
you see that we might be heading already

323
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,079
towards new standards for post quantum

324
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,040
crypto

325
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,360
but as i said before the competition is

326
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,959
my most likely

327
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,440
uh going to continue with the fourth

328
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,600
round especially for the submission

329
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
calling for submission of new

330
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,800
digital signature schemes now

331
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,680
the standardization efforts are great

332
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,399
but

333
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,600
you know as as researchers in general or

334
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,760
security researchers or security

335
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,200
practitioners the

336
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,959
i'm sure the first question that comes

337
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,279
to mind is that how are we going to

338
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,160
transition

339
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,120
from current cryptographic systems which

340
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,800
you know in most cases they are

341
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,200
either even non-existing which actually

342
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,160
it might make it a bit easier to do that

343
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,720
or there are legacy systems that rely on

344
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,680
very old

345
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,440
implementations and very and old schemes

346
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,320
with

347
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,360
um reduced key sizes and

348
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,839
bits bit level uh security security

349
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,160
and obviously we will face we will face

350
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,480
lots of challenges and complexities in

351
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
this roadmap to transition

352
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,199
from whatever we have deployed today

353
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,880
in terms of um data address script

354
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,360
security cryptographic systems and

355
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,600
secure communication solutions so how

356
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,279
are we going to move from whatever

357
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,680
exists today in the classical sense

358
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,480
to post quantum alternatives and here

359
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,079
you see lots of efforts that are

360
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:58,800
happening

361
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,720
to introduce what we call a hybrid

362
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,560
approach or

363
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,440
or basically hybrid schemes and it is

364
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,560
very crucial

365
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,760
for um for organizations

366
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,240
to recommend to to deploy and

367
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,320
researchers to or practitioners to

368
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,519
recommend

369
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,040
agile cryptosystems so in the hybrid

370
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,120
sense basically the evolution towers

371
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,199
post quantum crypto will be using a

372
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,639
hybrid approach

373
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,040
between classical standardized

374
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,560
algorithms combined

375
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,040
with new post quantum algorithms so for

376
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
example for key exchange or for key

377
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,560
establishment we would use

378
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,240
a an extension between

379
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
the key exchange algorithms as we know

380
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,760
them today and key encapsulation

381
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,040
and and also there should be a hybrid

382
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,959
approach because today we still don't

383
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,680
have

384
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,839
standardized primitives a hybrid

385
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,240
approach between post quantum

386
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,680
and uh postponed so

387
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,279
i guess this is uh this is it for the

388
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,680
post quantum talk and i see myself that

389
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,079
i already by past 16 minutes and

390
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,040
i have instructions to only stick to 20

391
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
minutes so i will go

392
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,959
very quickly through the second part of

393
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,320
this talk

394
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,240
and it is basically the

395
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,279
application of or basically the the

396
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,839
intersection of machine learning and

397
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,760
cryptography

398
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,160
so cryptography based on what i've been

399
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,079
saying and what you guys know it seems

400
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,600
like a complex problem

401
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,440
mathematics um constructions etc

402
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
so the question comes how can machine

403
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
learning contribute to any crypto field

404
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,000
so if if i if we take a step back and

405
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
put it quite simply

406
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,160
machine learning learns from training

407
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,720
data it makes predictions on your data

408
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,639
through a model built through through

409
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,560
the machine learning model that

410
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,279
we built does this help tackle all

411
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,199
crypto problems

412
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,399
well not quite we have the np hard or

413
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,839
the intractable problems that are not a

414
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,800
candidate because

415
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,880
implied operations and complex in

416
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,320
complexity

417
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,480
classes are not probabilistically and

418
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,920
approximately learnable

419
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,279
as i said it takes a quantum computer

420
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,600
capable of running shore algorithm

421
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,800
in order to achieve that but what this

422
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,680
means

423
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,160
is that what we can do is define

424
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,880
problems

425
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,720
or models probabilistically and

426
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,240
approximately

427
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
so for each plain text x with a

428
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,519
distribution of v

429
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,759
and a mapping function c we can learn a

430
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,560
model

431
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,920
which maps x to a value and

432
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,880
it it maps actually x to a value and

433
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,279
that

434
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,279
value would agree with the cipher text

435
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,120
with a very high probability

436
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,399
so basically i managed to approximate a

437
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,959
cryptographic problem with a machine

438
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,399
learning model

439
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,399
and the output of this machine learning

440
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,400
model agrees with

441
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,480
the output of the cryptosystem or the

442
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,640
ciphertext with a very high probability

443
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
so what i'm trying to say here i i think

444
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,119
i i went to

445
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,359
too complex here but what this means to

446
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,319
cryptography

447
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,319
and this is today actually this is one

448
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,760
of the main research problem

449
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,599
that we are working on cii and this is

450
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,880
fairly leading edge is that how can

451
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,280
machine learning how can i use this what

452
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,799
i just mentioned

453
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,520
for machine learning to help with

454
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,559
cryptanalysis

455
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,520
um and and you know as i mentioned

456
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,039
before cryptanalysis

457
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,280
is the opposite of cryptography so it is

458
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,080
concerned

459
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,880
with recovering a plain text from the

460
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,760
cipher text

461
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,640
either by recovering a key or by finding

462
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,960
a relationship between the cipher text

463
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,720
and the plain text

464
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,160
um you know cryptanalysis is just not

465
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,280
one text okay

466
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,440
not one test that the researcher does

467
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,039
and that's it it's a set of tests

468
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,240
between

469
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,720
linear algebraic meet in the middle

470
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,240
attacks etc

471
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,240
and the question is how can machine

472
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,520
learning help

473
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,840
speed up and automate cryptanalysis

474
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,640
obviously this can only be beneficial if

475
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
we find algorithms

476
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,960
with a space complexity that grows

477
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,559
logarithmically to the size

478
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,080
to the size of the feeding data and

479
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,080
one cryptanalysis way which we are

480
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,600
exploring today

481
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,760
is to help find differential

482
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,080
characteristics and estimate states

483
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,120
inside

484
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,520
the cipher between plain text and

485
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,720
ciphertext

486
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
and the better the quality of this

487
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,880
non-linear relationship

488
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,760
the harder it is to find this model and

489
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,600
the stronger

490
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,320
the cipher text will be the cipher text

491
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,520
will look closer

492
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,960
to a random question now if this

493
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,679
relationship between the the clear text

494
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:00,880
what you see here as

495
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,320
p1 and the cipher text is not as good

496
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,120
a machine learning model can can be

497
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,840
found

498
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,720
so how does this help basically the the

499
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,760
model

500
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,320
helps analyze crypto algorithms in a

501
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,559
faster and a more automated automated

502
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,080
way

503
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,720
it helps basically do more automa or

504
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,760
basically faster

505
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,640
unautomated analysis for differential

506
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,760
attacks over

507
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,559
crypto cryptographics uh cryptographic

508
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,320
implementation so both from

509
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,360
design security and the implementation

510
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,559
this model help decipher or break

511
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,400
cryptographic algorithms

512
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,559
and then by doing so it helps you

513
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
because it highlights to you

514
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,720
the security properties it can help

515
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,559
increase the security bounds

516
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,080
in cypher designs

517
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,200
i have many more slides but i guess i'm

518
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,799
running out of time

519
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,440
the second area where machine learning

520
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,760
can help in the cryptographic field

521
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,520
is also it's a cryptanalytic

522
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,200
area um but it can help with

523
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,480
implementation based uh crypt analysis

524
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,080
so

525
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,679
and this is actually machine learning

526
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,200
can be quite uh

527
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,760
quite powerful here so to explain a bit

528
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,400
better

529
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,200
one of the most common ways to recover

530
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,760
keys

531
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,240
and subsequently clear text today is

532
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
side channel analysis and this is you

533
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,880
know

534
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,280
typically it requires physical access

535
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
and it requires

536
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,080
getting signals or traces from a

537
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,480
specific crypto algorithm obviously you

538
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,440
have this

539
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
signal processing part in order to

540
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,120
pinpoint exactly where

541
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,280
the crypto algorithm is running um

542
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,159
but machine learning is one actually of

543
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,080
it's it's quite powerful

544
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,919
to be a help or to be of assistance in

545
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,600
side channel analysis so today

546
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,480
basically i'm not going to to go into

547
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,799
the detail of side channel analysis but

548
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,080
supervised learning

549
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,840
especially mlp and cnns

550
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,840
can help quite a bit for profiling

551
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,720
and stochastic and template attacks when

552
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,520
it comes to

553
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,200
side channel attacks we can use machine

554
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,840
learning

555
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,960
in in side channel attacks for

556
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,000
classification

557
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,960
clustering feature engineering and

558
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,600
pre-processing

559
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,400
in particular are quite uh basically

560
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
convolutional neural networks

561
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,880
they are in particular quite useful for

562
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,600
this

563
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,799
because they learn abstract abstract

564
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,200
representation

565
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,640
with at each level or at each layer of

566
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,919
of the network so they work best um

567
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,480
this is you know this this area of using

568
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,799
machine learning inside channel analysis

569
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,440
is still

570
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,400
fairly new however it is it is quite

571
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,200
promising

572
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,080
and it is to be thoroughly tested even

573
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,840
in the presence of masking

574
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,640
thresholding and other countermeasures

575
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,679
machine learning can help with deploying

576
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,080
security on energy constrained devices

577
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,480
and this is one of the main areas that

578
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,159
i'm personally

579
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,960
quite active in the research of and here

580
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
the idea without going into the detail

581
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,400
of that

582
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,520
here the the the idea is that

583
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,559
i use quantized neural networks or

584
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,320
prune neural networks um

585
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,080
on embedded embedded devices

586
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,200
um because you know to today a ns have

587
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,280
found really good success in big data

588
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,480
applications

589
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,120
there is a quite significant interest of

590
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,600
using artificial neural networks for

591
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,080
medium and small data applications that

592
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,799
can be run

593
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,000
on embedded systems sensors iot

594
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,240
devices energy constraint devices in

595
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,120
general

596
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
however lots of efforts that have been

597
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,960
done to migrate those a

598
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,960
ns to such devices has has entered a

599
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,919
a big loss a big loss function or a big

600
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,679
a significant loss

601
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,799
to the classification accuracy so

602
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,159
here what what this this uh you know the

603
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,559
the research here is about pruning

604
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,159
neural networks

605
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,679
and to be able to run efficiently

606
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,400
with an acceptable accuracy on embedded

607
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,679
devices

608
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,240
and basically what this does is that by

609
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,840
having those pure

610
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,039
the the pro neural networks and that are

611
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,200
fairly energy efficient and then that

612
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,280
can run on the energy on on the

613
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,840
end device or the edge device you can

614
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,640
have

615
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,760
lots of computational power and that is

616
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,559
saved by

617
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,760
having on device

618
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
on device intelligence and basically not

619
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,679
using this

620
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,080
uh and then saving power and not using

621
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,240
this power for constant communication

622
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,600
between an edge device

623
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
and the cloud so you save on the

624
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,799
communication energy

625
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,440
and you would be able to run further you

626
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,640
would be able to do

627
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,200
inference on device not needing an

628
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,640
external communication

629
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,360
for doing the intelligence uh on on a

630
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,600
cloud or an external server

631
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,679
and then by saving this energy you would

632
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,120
be able to run

633
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,840
further cryptographic functions or

634
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,240
cryptographic protocols or other

635
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,360
security mechanisms on the edge device

636
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,400
itself

637
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,679
and then finally machine learning

638
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,799
can be quite useful in the context of

639
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,000
confidential computing

640
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,320
privacy preserving schemes in general

641
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,240
fully homomorphic encryption etc

642
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
unfortunately i don't have time

643
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,960
to go through it by but basically the

644
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,840
idea here

645
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,120
is that by using machine learning so i

646
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,360
execute a machine learning algorithm to

647
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,880
a computing service

648
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
while retaining confidentiality of the

649
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,480
data so basically using homomorphic

650
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,200
encryption schemes i keep my data

651
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,279
encrypted and then i do

652
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,440
operations on my encrypted data so i can

653
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,840
manipulate the data i can do any complex

654
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,720
operation of the data without

655
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,200
decrypting it so for example

656
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,279
a cloud service can perform several

657
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,840
tasks without exposing this

658
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,440
private information however today

659
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,159
this is still fhe or full homomorphic

660
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,480
encryption is still considered as

661
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,159
the holy grail of cryptography

662
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,279
it's still quite slow so as you can

663
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,679
imagine for real-time operations that's

664
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,000
quite

665
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,400
a problem however you know there's lots

666
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,440
of a lot

667
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,640
of research efforts that are going

668
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,760
into fhe and to heart and

669
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
also you know doing software

670
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,000
optimization and developing hardware

671
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,080
accelerators um as well um

672
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,200
you know there is a very clear um very

673
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,039
clear use case for federated learning

674
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,120
and i guess i will i will stop here

675
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,679
i would be very happy to take uh

676
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,600
questions online and hopefully on the

677
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,840
day i will be able to be online as well

678
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,360
to take your questions

679
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,840
thank you very much once again and i do

680
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,440
hope that you enjoy the talk when you

681
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,000
listen to

682
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,919
it bye
