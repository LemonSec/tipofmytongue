00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,359
hello

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,279
my name is michael mcginley and i'm a

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,960
cyber security analyst at pwc uk

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,480
today i'm going to be talking about the

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,400
effect of industry 4.0

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,480
on industrial control systems security

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,480
architecture

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,480
some of you may already be familiar with

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,000
industrial control systems

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,480
and what security for them looks like

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,000
but some of you may be entirely new to

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,599
the concept

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,920
i hope that if you're an ics novice this

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,519
talk will give you a good overview

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,680
of ics and the challenges of securing

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,800
them

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
and if you have some knowledge of ics

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,480
then you will learn something about what

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,319
the future of ics security holds

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,960
i'm going to explore the security issues

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,280
in ics and what makes them different

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,399
from it systems

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,600
in this regard we'll then look at

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,399
architectures

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,239
such as the purdue model shown on the

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,800
right and examine the proposed solutions

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,640
to creating secure architecture for

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,079
industry 4.0

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,440
and industrial internet of things

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,000
technology

31
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,400
we'll look into the purdue model in more

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,720
detail and talk about the implications

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,159
of applying the purdue model

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,880
to industry 4.0 and industrial internet

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,759
of things networks

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,320
so what are industrial control systems

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,280
well when people talk about industrial

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,400
control systems

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,600
they often use the terms ot ics

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,640
and scada they use them interchangeably

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,840
but they do have different meanings

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
operational technology is simply the

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,880
computer systems

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,840
which are used to manage industrial

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,640
operations

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
industrial control systems are used to

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,280
monitor and control industrial processes

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
such as robotic arms safety systems and

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,720
valve controls

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,119
scada is the systems which allow

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,799
operators to monitor the running

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,759
processes

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,439
and provide access to control

54
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,439
functionality

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,040
well normally you would find scada

56
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,479
software installed on machines

57
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,399
within a control room monitoring an

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,000
entire plant

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
in more modern systems you might find

60
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,239
scada software distributed across much

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,039
larger areas

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,879
industrial control systems are not a new

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,680
concept but the trend that we have seen

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,520
is that they become more complex and

65
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
distributed across

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
larger areas

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,239
within ics there are common devices you

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,200
may find

69
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,879
such as programmable logic controllers

70
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,000
which are essentially industrial

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,720
computers which take input from sensors

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,400
process processor state and trigger

73
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,319
output

74
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,400
you'll also find remote terminal units

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
which are similar to plcs

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
but their main purpose is for

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,200
communication of process to scatter

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,920
systems

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,519
with sun control you'll also find cuban

80
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,120
machine interfaces

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,440
which are allow operators to monitor the

82
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,840
status of industrial operations

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,440
and make changes scada software

84
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,159
will sometimes have hmi functionality

85
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,080
but also the ability to reprogram

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
plcs operators can monitor the status of

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,959
multiple processes

88
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,200
distributed across an entire plant or a

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,560
large geographical area

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,920
moving on to indus industry 4.0 and the

91
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,200
industrial internet of things

92
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,720
industry 4.0 from this definition by

93
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,000
angela merkel

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
is essentially the fusion of the online

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,680
world and the world

96
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,480
of industrial production industry 4.0

97
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,920
is all about processes becoming smarter

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
we now have smart factories which

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,879
include devices such as iiot sensors

100
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,159
often connected to cloud systems

101
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,720
these cyber physical systems give us

102
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,920
increased efficiency

103
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
predictive maintenance and a whole host

104
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,720
of other benefits

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,200
unfortunately interconnectivity brings

106
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,439
with its security challenges

107
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,799
as we have more opportunities for

108
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,280
attacks

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,760
security now needs to be a focus from

110
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,879
the start

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,560
rather than afterthought as it

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,159
traditionally was with industrial

113
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,519
control systems

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,519
in order to mitigate the risks that come

115
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,040
from these new technologies

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
and get manufacturers comfortable with

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,478
them

118
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,079
now let's talk about the purdue

119
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,600
enterprise reference architecture

120
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,840
sometimes called the purdue model this

121
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,759
is a model for enterprise architecture

122
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,120
it segments the control system

123
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,600
architecture into six levels

124
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,440
each of which having its own specific

125
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,120
purpose

126
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
this helps isolate critical control

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
zones from enterprise zones

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,400
and therefore reduces the risk of

129
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,599
attacks to ics

130
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,120
level four and five are the highest

131
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,199
levels and focus on enterprise

132
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,360
technology and systems

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,280
common systems you might find here are

134
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,720
web servers mail servers

135
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
and enterprise workstations

136
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
between levels four and three is the

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,520
demilitarized zone

138
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
which often resides between two

139
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,520
firewalls

140
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,680
in level three you'll find manufacturing

141
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,960
operations

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,440
and systems such as historians and also

143
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,120
systems for monitoring overall plan

144
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,680
performance

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,639
level two are the control systems which

146
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,639
usually includes scada devices and hmis

147
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,039
level one we have basic control level

148
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,800
where we have devices such as plcs and

149
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,880
rtus

150
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,960
and then at level zero is the process

151
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,160
itself

152
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
with sensors and actuators or anything

153
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,840
else connected directly to the process

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,840
there's a few common issues when it

155
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,600
comes to securing operational technology

156
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,080
high availability is one of the greatest

157
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,800
requirements

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
of ot this is because downtime can be

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,440
extremely costly

160
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
and sometimes dangerous in the case of

161
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,560
safety critical systems

162
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,400
there is also this reliance on legacy

163
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,800
systems where it's not uncommon to see

164
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,840
windows 7

165
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,759
or even older running within factory

166
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,360
environments

167
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,800
and this is because it's not cost

168
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,360
effective to upgrade apache systems

169
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,080
and doing so can create unpredictable

170
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,639
environments

171
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,680
there are also vulnerabilities present

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,639
in these legacy

173
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,160
and commercial off-the-shelf systems

174
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,960
furthermore misconfiguration

175
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,800
particularly with firewalls

176
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,560
can allow systems within different zones

177
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,479
to communicate which should not normally

178
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,840
be permitted

179
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,639
many of the ot communications protocols

180
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,160
such as modbus

181
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,280
are insecure and have no encryption

182
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,880
these were designed in a time when

183
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,600
security wasn't really thought about

184
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,080
but now as we have more

185
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,520
interconnectivity it's becoming a real

186
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:51,919
issue

187
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,159
using these older unsecured protocols

188
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
the demand for internet connectivity has

189
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,440
also been accelerated by covert 19.

190
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,479
and because of this we have seen some

191
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,560
poorly implemented configurations for

192
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,919
remote access

193
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,400
which in ot environments can be very

194
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,360
costly

195
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,319
and also dangerous

196
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,319
and there's also this difference in

197
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,599
security skill set between ot and it

198
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,280
because you sometimes have two security

199
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,440
departments who don't work together

200
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,639
or don't understand each other's needs

201
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,520
looking at a case study of an ics attack

202
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,360
let's look at the 2015 black energy

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,000
attack

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,280
on ukraine's power grid now this was a

205
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,400
top-down attack

206
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,000
where the attackers got access to the

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
enterprise zone

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,080
stole vpn credentials and moved

209
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,599
downwards to attack control zones

210
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,240
and this resulted in 225 000 customers

211
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,120
being without power

212
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,520
post incident analysis showed the attack

213
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,000
came from a spear phishing campaign

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,680
where corporate workstations were

215
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,840
infected with the black energy 3 malware

216
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,080
the attackers gained access to vpn

217
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
credentials which allowed them to pivot

218
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,919
to control networks

219
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,400
from there scatter workstation and hmis

220
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,599
were compromised

221
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,360
as well as uninterruptible power

222
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
supplies

223
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,160
and this follows this typical ics attack

224
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,280
flow

225
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,360
which normally flows down the way from

226
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,680
the enterprise zones

227
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,440
the attackers gain access to corporate

228
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,960
or enterprise network

229
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,039
often through traditional methods such

230
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,680
as spear phishing

231
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,839
they then extend foothold and corporate

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,799
network

233
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,559
and find devices which should give them

234
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,760
access to the lower levels

235
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,279
and if they do gain access to the lower

236
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,000
levels they disrupt the processes

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,040
and often cause a lot of damage

238
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,279
so how can the purdue model fit into

239
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,720
industry 4.0

240
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,839
and industrial internet of things

241
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,160
environments

242
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
well there's this issue with

243
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,839
segmentation the purdue model

244
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,880
has a reliance on segmentation

245
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,360
but industry 4.0 has a reliance on

246
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,240
interconnectivity

247
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,080
within industrial internet of things

248
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,279
environments

249
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,440
we no longer have the hierarchical data

250
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,800
flow

251
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,959
devices further down the model becomes

252
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,080
smarter

253
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
and therefore more opportunities for

254
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,560
attack are created

255
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
we don't have this logical separation of

256
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,600
the control networks

257
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,880
from the enterprise networks anymore

258
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,200
and this is because the data to increase

259
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,399
efficiency

260
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,240
can be gathered and processed at level 1

261
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,279
and 0 and sent directly to the cloud

262
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,519
bypassing the logical hierarchy of the

263
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,160
purdue model

264
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
if we were to create some sort of system

265
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
which sent data

266
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
from the iot devices through each of the

267
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
layers of the purdue model

268
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,000
this could actually result in increased

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,680
overheads and

270
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,399
such an implementation could increase

271
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,160
opportunities for exposure

272
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,360
due to misconfiguration

273
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,040
as the architectures now bypass the

274
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,360
traditional hierarchical levels

275
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,279
is the purdue model now outdated

276
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,079
i would argue the issue of ot and iot

277
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,920
converging isn't new

278
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
and as we have seen most incidents seem

279
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,279
to be as a result

280
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,160
of misconfiguration or error rather than

281
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,519
an issue with the underlying

282
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,079
architecture

283
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,800
if we were to have this iot edge gateway

284
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,079
which connects across

285
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,640
the entire enterprise environment this

286
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,160
gives us a critical component

287
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,719
to secure

288
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,880
but if we were to move away from the

289
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,959
project model we may be presented with

290
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,880
more concerns

291
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,959
the success of the model demonstrates

292
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:43,920
the level of trust

293
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
that enterprises have given to it and

294
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,040
many businesses

295
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
may be reluctant to design their

296
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,000
networks on new and untested

297
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,560
architectures

298
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
if we were to move away from the model

299
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
and the rigid segmentation

300
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,920
there could be an even greater

301
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,839
possibility for misconfiguration

302
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,160
issues

303
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,839
moving to industry 4.0 and industrial

304
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,800
internet of things

305
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,839
will also take some time

306
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,560
experts have suggested in the interim

307
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,680
period

308
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,160
we create this hybrid approach creating

309
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,839
an edge gateway layer

310
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,200
within the purdue model and this is one

311
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,839
method

312
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,320
of adapting the purdue architecture to

313
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,920
modern systems

314
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,000
this is one of the most promising models

315
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,079
which retains the six level approach

316
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,600
from the purdue model we see the iot

317
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,320
platform

318
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,800
situated at level three alongside

319
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,000
traditional systems

320
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,040
such as a data historian

321
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,720
level five in this instance have been

322
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
replaced of a cloud layer

323
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,600
and includes external cloud services

324
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,000
the iot platform provides information to

325
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
the systems above

326
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
as well as bi-directional communication

327
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,800
with sensors and actuators below

328
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
in this model the firewalls are retained

329
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,560
but they're not shown here

330
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,200
this model was published in 2018 so it's

331
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,399
fairly recent

332
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,839
we don't have any information about

333
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:06,959
whether it's been implemented by

334
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,560
enterprises

335
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,240
the documented features in good

336
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,920
practices for security of internet of

337
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,880
things

338
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,720
is perhaps more beneficial for modern

339
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,880
systems and historic standards in this

340
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,600
area

341
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,040
such as the nest 882 standard

342
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
i would recommend reading the enisa good

343
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,160
practice document

344
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,519
if you're interested in further

345
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,720
implementation specifics

346
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,839
there are also some other good

347
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,079
recommendations for iot security

348
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,440
beyond architecture one of these is xero

349
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,880
trust

350
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
as i mentioned with the modbus protocol

351
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,399
ot security

352
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,880
edition relied on a lack of encryption

353
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,320
or authentication

354
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,519
and implicit trust not only is this

355
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,519
extremely outdated and unsafe

356
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,680
but modern systems with multiple devices

357
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,120
from many vendors

358
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,320
it doesn't work therefore

359
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,240
zero trust means that there is no trust

360
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,160
by default and all devices should be

361
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,680
hardened before implementation

362
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,920
next generation firewalls can also

363
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,279
provide us with enhanced logging and

364
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,560
threat detection

365
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,200
connecting directly to cloud platforms

366
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,360
we can send logs to data lakes

367
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,920
use threat intel feeds and also use deep

368
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,800
pack inspection

369
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,440
asset management is another key area for

370
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
securing ics

371
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,760
modern networks are complex and have

372
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
thousands of connected devices

373
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,440
within either enterprise or control

374
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
zones

375
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,560
businesses must therefore ensure they

376
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,399
have an up to up-to-date inventory

377
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,200
but it's not easy and so various tools

378
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,920
are available

379
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,880
for modern asset management some of

380
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,720
these are integrated also into security

381
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,079
tools

382
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,240
for integration of iot and ot security

383
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,199
alerts

384
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,639
and security entered into event

385
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,120
monitoring or security orchestration and

386
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,600
response

387
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,240
palo alto network's iot security as your

388
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,920
defender for iot

389
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,839
and drago's platform are all good tools

390
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,720
available

391
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,399
some of these use anomalous traffic

392
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,800
detection using machine learning

393
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,560
alongside traditional signature based

394
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,040
alerts

395
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,360
in conclusion is it time to part ways to

396
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,240
the purdue model

397
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,000
well increasingly cyber attacks are

398
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,680
having more physical effects

399
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,199
and becoming more dangerous experts are

400
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,959
warning that it's a matter of when

401
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,040
rather than if a cyber attack kills

402
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,880
someone

403
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
in the last year a german hospital was

404
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,959
held with a ransomware attack

405
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,120
which indirectly resulted in an ane

406
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,240
patient's death

407
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,680
as the ambulance had to be diverted

408
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,160
while this is an indirect death as we

409
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,120
see more convergence between ot and i.t

410
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,279
expect to see more attacks and possibly

411
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,800
even direct deaths

412
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,319
as a result of cyber security

413
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,360
but as we've seen from the attacks it's

414
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,639
not the architecture which creates

415
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,399
security issues

416
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,639
it's the humans in misconfiguration or

417
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,800
having security as an afterthought

418
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,320
which has long been a common issue

419
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,120
within ics

420
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,279
that being said having an up-to-date

421
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,560
trusted architecture

422
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,399
for administrators and designers to

423
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,600
follow

424
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
will help to ensure that systems are

425
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,000
secure from the outset

426
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,519
purdue is definitely still relevant in

427
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,600
this area considering that most

428
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,320
industries

429
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,920
will take some time to move beyond their

430
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,000
current setups and integrate

431
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,199
industrial internet of things

432
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,959
in the same breath we know the

433
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,720
traditional purdue model

434
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
isn't entirely applicable for modern

435
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,839
systems due to its reliance on strict

436
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,120
segmentation

437
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,199
and so architectures such as the enisa

438
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,839
model should be considered and tested

439
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,160
enabling businesses to stay protected

440
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,000
and be prepared for industry 4.0

441
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,680
thank you very much for listening and
