1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,200
hello and welcome to offensive azure

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,559
security session

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,400
my name is sergey and i will be your

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,960
presenter for the next 20 minutes

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,440
this is the lite version of this session

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,440
so you will see only one scenario how

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,680
things may be compromised but even this

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,480
scenario will give you some ideas

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,960
if you're a defender so you will find

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,680
what can you

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,400
fix if you are fantastic it will give

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,359
you ideas

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,679
how you can try to compromise

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,399
application

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,600
in the cloud environment so let's get

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,120
started before i

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,760
i start to show you the content uh let

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,079
me say a few words about myself and i

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,800
promise you

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,399
we're going to start so my name is

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,480
sergey once again um

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,000
very important where i'm from i'm from

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,520
russia so

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,920
that's my burden to do all of this

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,719
hacking

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,920
and as you can see on the slide i i do a

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,879
lot of fantastic

28
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,359
and also i'm an instructor conference

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,239
speaker

30
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,719
if you want to contact me during the

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,319
session after the session whatever it

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:04,959
may be

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,960
here's the linkedin url go ahead and

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,159
find me you may

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
ask something say something or you may

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,320
just find some other conferences where i

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,280
speak

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,920
so here in the slide you may see three

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,439
scenarios i usually

40
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,720
show on this session so first scenario

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,080
is hybrid active directory so when you

42
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,040
have

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,360
on-prem id in the cloud id and how you

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,159
compromise

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,720
all of this environment then the second

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,040
scenario is how you can compromise

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,560
virtual machines and of course

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,240
application deployed in those virtual

49
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,119
machines

50
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,000
and the last one is bus where you have a

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,799
number of

52
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,280
services past services and how you can

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,799
pen test them

54
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,360
since that's the only light version so

55
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,880
that's a light version of the session

56
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,799
you will see only one scenario the last

57
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,399
one which is

58
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,040
for many should be the most interesting

59
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,960
so let's take a look on that

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,079
and here we going to cover um

61
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,439
application which is which should be a

62
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,399
bit more interesting in this application

63
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,920
we will have application web application

64
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,679
with a sql database backend

65
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,480
also the the credentials to access

66
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,319
backend will not be stored

67
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,560
um locally on the web application it

68
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,319
will be stored in the key vault and the

69
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,000
credentials they will be

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,200
rotated periodically with azure

71
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,000
functions

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
and also application will be protected

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,160
with application gateway in front

74
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,599
with the feature enabled so it looks

75
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,239
looks like this application is quite

76
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,120
secure

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
but let's try that first let's try that

78
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,800
so i'm gonna jump back to demo as usual

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
now let's take a look

80
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,879
how can i try to get into this

81
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,120
application

82
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,959
let me show you one more slide to give

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,640
an idea what may be

84
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,599
in our case an entry point so my goal my

85
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,480
initial

86
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,480
my my goal is to get access to database

87
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,239
because all of the the most interesting

88
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,720
things will be there

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,120
but easier as you remember credentials

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,080
are to access database will be stored

91
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
in key vault um let's first test if i

92
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,280
have access to key vault or not

93
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,720
i'm going to go to keyboard maybe this

94
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
user that was compromised already have

95
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,120
access to key vault

96
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,400
let's see that if i go to secrets

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,920
no there is no permissions to access key

98
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,480
vault

99
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,239
let me quickly give permissions to

100
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,680
myself to just show you

101
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,120
that um

102
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,440
those something something exists there

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,200
i'm gonna just give permission to list

104
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,040
click add

105
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
here and go back to secrets refresh

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,959
no oh damn it i didn't save it

107
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,480
sorry um

108
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,760
let's try again click add and let's

109
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,159
click save

110
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,560
and now if i go to secrets i should yeah

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,200
i have

112
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,360
password here pass and username

113
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,000
so let me remove this permission click

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,560
save again

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,560
and now let's try to somehow

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,560
get access to to those secrets

117
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,680
and for me entry point will be

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
key rotation function because it's very

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,199
commanded to have

120
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,000
key rotation keys or secrets in my case

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,759
rotation

122
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,160
and on microsoft website you may even

123
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,880
find

124
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
the function that will rotate

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,320
the secret in the keyboard and on the

126
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,400
target application like sql database

127
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,440
on our target so

128
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,280
here's a slide with my with my function

129
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,240
so i have a function

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,800
and this function will like change

131
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,600
password

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,840
on in sql database and the keyword at

133
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,919
the same time

134
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,720
and what the typical problem that i find

135
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,880
periodically

136
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,240
in there in the real world a

137
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
function has different configuration

138
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,759
compared to key vault

139
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,280
so key vault may be very restrictive

140
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,160
but the same time function will have

141
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,720
also

142
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,960
like either permissions inherited from

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,400
subscription

144
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,960
and so function will have a bit more

145
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,680
permissions

146
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,600
so so users will have a bit more

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,000
permissions on that function compared to

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,880
keyword

149
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,039
let me show you what i can do if i if i

150
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,800
have a case like this so i'm going to go

151
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,600
to

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,840
portal and find functions

153
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,000
function applications and here i have

154
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,479
one function

155
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,320
so let's take a look at what what do we

156
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
have here

157
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,240
in under one function application i have

158
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,280
two functions

159
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,000
a one is triggered by event grid second

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,919
one is triggered by http

161
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,840
this one is will be more interesting for

162
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,680
me because i can trigger that manually

163
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
so let me show you the code

164
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,440
come on and so by default when i deploy

165
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,160
the function

166
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,280
from from

167
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,560
microsoft github from from github

168
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,600
it will show me the code like this so

169
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,479
this code is

170
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,800
is the legit code to rotate secret

171
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,280
but what may where maybe the problem the

172
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
problem is

173
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,400
by default function is ac may be

174
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
accessed

175
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
via ftp so if you look at the

176
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,479
configuration of the function

177
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,440
you may find that in general settings

178
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,160
ftp

179
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,319
is enabled by default most in most cases

180
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,360
you don't use that

181
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,560
but it's enabled by default and so

182
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,680
feel go to the deployment center

183
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,680
um you may find ftp credentials here

184
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,319
and so here's the ftp credentials so now

185
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,440
let me try to get

186
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,199
those credentials but of course as usual

187
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,560
from command prompt

188
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,440
um so let me open command prompt here

189
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,319
and let's try to get

190
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,319
uh first of all a url for ftp url

191
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,039
to connect the function so here's the

192
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,599
ftp url let me copy this

193
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,880
and paste to filezilla and then i want

194
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,759
to get

195
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,960
credentials of this function

196
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,360
of this function application and here's

197
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,120
the username

198
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,720
here's the username paste here

199
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,599
and here is the password let me copy

200
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,919
this

201
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,120
here's the password and now

202
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,160
i have permissions to log in there

203
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,000
and i can see here the structure which

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,919
is my two functions

205
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,080
let me go to to the http function and

206
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,960
here i can and

207
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,560
here i can see the structure of the

208
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
function what i can do

209
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,960
i can upload i can upload my own code

210
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,160
and so this code with the name called

211
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,400
around.ps1 in this case it's the partial

212
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,280
function

213
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,759
so i can upload my

214
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,919
around.ps1 code and this code will be

215
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,879
executed when

216
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,520
function is triggered and so this

217
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,080
function

218
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
because the function has permissions to

219
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,520
access keyboard

220
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
i will access keyword and i will get

221
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,760
information from keyboard on behalf

222
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,679
of function and my code will just get

223
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,839
information i need from keyboard let's

224
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,799
try that

225
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,000
i'm going to just open powershell and

226
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,200
run the command like this

227
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,160
and so let's let's try to get

228
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,760
credentials from

229
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,680
from key vault fingers crossed i will

230
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,240
get it

231
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,560
also by the way i can go to function

232
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
itself and

233
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,279
and just take a look when it was any

234
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,839
when it was executed if i click monitor

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
nothing here maybe already yeah it's

236
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,480
ready give me

237
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,279
give me information so um it's finished

238
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,600
now i can see the username is web app

239
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,160
and the password is password

240
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,959
and those credentials are will be used

241
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,959
to connect to

242
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,279
sql server so let's try to connect the

243
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,160
sql server now

244
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,720
first let me take this url and type my

245
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,959
password

246
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,480
and now i can see i always connected

247
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,800
um and i can see my database with tables

248
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:04,240
and the content there

249
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,440
and there's there's only one record

250
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,480
there

251
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
let me try to do the same from the

252
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
different workstation let me

253
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,640
just connect copy this from different

254
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
workstation

255
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,279
and now it says hey you can't do it

256
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,959
because firewall

257
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,839
does not allow you to connect to this

258
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,000
server

259
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,959
interesting let's take a look how this

260
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,240
fire will look like

261
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,600
now let's go to database and open this

262
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,800
database

263
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,120
so every sql database in the cloud has

264
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,079
this

265
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,440
sql server has the firewall database as

266
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,480
well by the way

267
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,040
so if i if i if i click firewall i can

268
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,839
find here

269
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,000
very interesting configuration which is

270
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,399
very very typical

271
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,000
uh this firewall this firewall has this

272
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,320
option enabled it says allow azure

273
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,480
services and the resources to access

274
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,720
this server

275
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,760
what does it mean many people think that

276
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
it means that their azure virtual

277
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,040
machines

278
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
their azure services may access this

279
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,720
database

280
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,000
but in fact it is not really true this

281
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,279
option means that

282
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,040
any any once again any

283
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,079
azure ip address will be able

284
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,399
to access this sql server so

285
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,839
a from any from any customer

286
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,640
subscription from any content from any

287
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
country in the world

288
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,440
you will be able to access

289
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,160
your sql server firewall will not filter

290
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,279
that at least

291
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,079
if you have this option enabled so quite

292
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,399
often

293
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,800
the the it professionals in company

294
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,320
security professionals they don't really

295
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,440
understand

296
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,480
the impact of this option so

297
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,000
if i have this option enabled then any

298
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,480
virtual machine in azure from with azure

299
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,440
ap address

300
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,000
may have access to my sql let me disable

301
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
this

302
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,680
and let's try to innate in

303
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,200
allow only um only

304
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
private access so there is no public

305
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,360
access at all

306
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
now now

307
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,120
um my sequel is probably better

308
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,320
now i have credentials

309
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,440
but axe allowed only from internal

310
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,959
network so i cannot

311
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,040
access from from anywhere

312
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,800
is it possible to get into database

313
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,399
yeah if we compromise the

314
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,959
application itself and so from

315
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,079
application

316
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,200
we can get access to sql database let's

317
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,839
try to do

318
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,200
to do it let me go back to

319
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,920
my portal and i'm gonna open application

320
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,600
um so if i just

321
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,079
uh go to application configuration you

322
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:14,959
may find here

323
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,320
network and if i click configure

324
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,160
networking it says hey

325
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,720
you must have a standard tier if you

326
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,440
want to

327
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,360
work with networking so let me upgrade

328
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,720
my application to s1

329
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,839
and so now i can connect my application

330
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:36,639
to network

331
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,240
let me do it real quick so i'm going to

332
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,480
say

333
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,079
add v-net and i want to connect my

334
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,600
application to

335
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,040
virtual click ok

336
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,519
and so that will take some time before

337
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,519
this application will be able to connect

338
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
so as you can see here it's it's already

339
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
con it's just connected

340
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
but in reality and what i can do

341
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,880
i can really quickly restart this

342
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,839
application

343
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,279
to speed things up so

344
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,040
now if i compromise this application

345
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,839
uh i will be able i should be able to

346
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,959
get into database the quite common

347
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,320
question wait a second but how to

348
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,079
compromise application especially if you

349
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,040
look at them

350
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,320
if you hear there's a vaf application

351
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,120
firewall

352
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,600
will not allow me to just simply get

353
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,199
into application

354
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,240
uh yes but i just want to remind you i

355
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,839
just want to really remind you

356
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,920
that we have for web application the

357
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,320
same default configuration

358
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,519
ftp is allowed if i

359
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,800
go click configuration and go to general

360
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,440
settings

361
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,000
i may find here ftp is allowed by

362
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,399
default

363
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,800
so quite often companies they do not

364
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,240
disable this ftp

365
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,120
and in the same manner i can get into

366
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,079
this application as before let me try to

367
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:06,880
do it

368
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,360
so let me close this and this

369
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,079
um now if i just

370
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,760
try the same let me find

371
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:27,600
a ftp url of the application

372
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,800
i'll copy this

373
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,800
and credentials as well

374
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,079
and so let me type credentials as well

375
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,440
so as you can see here this application

376
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,720
is nothing more than just a php page and

377
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,839
let's let's first explore this

378
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,759
application that

379
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,199
we'll just check that the application is

380
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,959
working let me

381
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,440
open the application itself let's click

382
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
here

383
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,199
i can see the application is here an

384
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,639
application is working so

385
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,920
let me just take a look if i say i'm a

386
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,639
user

387
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,800
let's call myself michael

388
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,959
and

389
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,000
let's say my email is amp smith whatever

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,360
it may be whatever.com and let's

391
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,079
say submit this this is working so it's

392
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,600
working with database application is

393
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,560
working

394
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,880
now let me jump back to my filezilla

395
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,560
and now what i can do if i if i know

396
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,720
that this application is php

397
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,959
what i can do i can upload my shell

398
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,079
and you know that php and sp as well by

399
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,199
the way

400
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,600
they they are executed on the server

401
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,480
side so the php will be executed

402
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,320
on the server side not on the client

403
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,079
side so if i

404
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,199
can upload my my own php code i can

405
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,440
execute something on server let me just

406
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,480
run my shell

407
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,839
and look at this so now i have access to

408
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,039
this workstation or the server through

409
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,400
web shell

410
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,559
web shell not not super interactive so

411
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,039
let me

412
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,720
establish establish the better shell

413
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,080
so on my web shell i want to to

414
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,880
fix the shell i want to make shell

415
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,160
better

416
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,360
and so now i have a shell

417
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,200
all right so what i can what what i

418
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
found here that

419
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,760
my username is just a regular user not

420
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,320
the

421
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,520
web server the web server user usually

422
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840
usually low pre low privileged users so

423
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
i will not be able to do whatever i want

424
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,200
on this server

425
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,720
my goal is to connect to sql database

426
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,160
but the problem is that regular server

427
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,799
doesn't have tools to connect to sql

428
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,200
server

429
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,160
um i need some sort of management studio

430
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,240
for linux as linux of course not visual

431
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,760
studio it's not management studio

432
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,799
it will be like a sql cli but

433
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,280
to install that i must be an admin i

434
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:17,840
have

435
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,679
i must have sudo permissions or root

436
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,240
permissions i don't have it

437
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,280
so what i can do here i can use some

438
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
third-party tools and the tool that you

439
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,480
may try called

440
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,080
u-sql this tool will run without insta

441
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,720
will work without installation and so

442
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
using u-sql

443
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,640
i will try to connect to sql database

444
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,720
i'm going to say

445
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,280
connect using the sql and looks like i

446
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,160
was connected

447
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,600
let's try to list tables

448
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,919
and look at this i can see two tables

449
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,840
there

450
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,840
so let's try to list the content

451
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,160
and look at this so my jundo and my

452
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,280
michael user

453
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,840
are there so now i have access to sql

454
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,720
database

455
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,799
so i hope all of this was informative

456
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,280
and you get an idea how those things

457
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,880
alright so we reached the end of the

458
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,080
session

459
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,320
i hope that was useful and interesting

460
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,679
and you found some ideas

461
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,200
how you can test your applications

462
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,840
better if you want to contact me

463
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,320
i will be happy to do it and i will be

464
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,679

465
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,960
as well thank you very much bye
