1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,720
we're coming to you live

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,320
we have someone that traveled all the

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,320
way from the us to come here

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,960
this is where we are very excited for

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,160
him to be here

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,960
it's a great honor the first thing i did

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,680
when i saw

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,880
ira was basically to ask him to sign my

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,600
books

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
thank you so much for being here it's a

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,160
great pleasure it's a great honor for us

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,880
and for

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,280
everybody

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,420
[Music]

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,040
speaker so it's kind of nice

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,920
and weird so but anyway thanks for

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,160
having me it's really appreciated

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,559
and i'm talking about human security

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,520
engineering

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,680
and this is kind of a new term for

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,039
everybody because i

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,120
invented it i think you know there

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,719
probably was something like human

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,360
security officer in star trek on deep

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,359
space nine but that doesn't really count

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,160
here

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,719
but human security engineering there was

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,000
a previous

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,519
on the previous talk they mentioned

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,520
ransomware and

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,360
when you mention ransomware everybody

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,520
looks at it as a user issue they're like

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,920
why did that stupid user click on these

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,400
things

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
and so on no matter what we do and the

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,439
reality of the situation is behind

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,240
every stupid user is a stupider security

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,520
professional

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,960
that knew basically put the user in a

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,360
position to click on a message

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,720
and then after that knew that they were

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,119
gonna click on it and didn't do enough

43
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,240
to stop them so

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,720
do you blame the user because i'll talk

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,880
about this going on in a little bit but

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,360
essentially you're blaming the proximity

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,240
of where the

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,759
error was was initiated

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,439
and i'm using the term the user

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,360
initiated loss and i'll cover that

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
i only have a half hour and 25 slides so

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
i better start moving

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,399
so let's talk about the twitter hack

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,719
you know the sad part is most people

55
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,880
have forgotten about the twitter hack

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,079
but a year ago in ancient cyber history

57
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,560
what happened was there was an attack

58
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,360
where

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,120
somebody a criminal mastermind took over

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,440
the top accounts on twitter they took

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,360
over president obama's accounts

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,200
they took over joe biden's accounts they

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,040
took over all these accounts

64
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,680
with more than a million followers and

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,640
at the time

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,840
twitter came out and they called it as

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,000
an advanced uh social engineering attack

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
a sophisticated social engineering

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,720
attack

70
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
and then they mentioned this mastermind

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,480
and all that sort of stuff

72
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,000
and then when they looked into it and

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,080
they caught the person really really

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,720
quickly

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,560
which says he wasn't much of a

76
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,760
mastermind

77
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,040
he was 17 years old and this

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,080
year old mastermind outsmarted all of

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,319
twitter's internal security

80
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,160
and so when you stop and think about it

81
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,760
what did the person really do

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,040
they used lots of social engineering and

83
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,959
they determined that what happened was

84
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,480
just calling people up

85
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
they found out that there was

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,920
administrator tools that basically let

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,519
any administrator

88
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,239
reset people's passwords and it turns

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,400
out that a thousand people

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
20 of twitter's employees had access to

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,400
change this and what made this really

92
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,080
really heinous was

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
about uh what was it like two years

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,680
before

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,920
some part some person was a german

96
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,000
engineer who was a contractor

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
and basically when he resigned from

98
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,560
twitter he said screw it and he deleted

99
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,519
donald trump's twitter account because

100
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,200
donald trump's twitter account is

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,080
obvious but anyway to that extent

102
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
you got to stop and think they knew

103
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,920
something can happen so what they do

104
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,840
they lock donald trump's twitter account

105
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,720
okay

106
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,360
what about the other accounts and yes it

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,799
was a coordinated

108
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,959
phishing attack where they went ahead

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,560
and compromised multi-factor

110
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,840
authentication

111
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,760
but still why did they allow access to

112
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,799
a tool that could compromise thousands

113
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,360
of top

114
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,120
accounts for pretty much any twitter

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,200
account except president trump's at the

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,840
time

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,040
now i'm going to co-work i'm going to

118
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,238
compare this to cloud flare and cloud

119
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,358
flare about

120
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,839
the same time as the twitter hack all of

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,040
a sudden went down

122
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
and took down a significant portion of

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,960
the websites on the internet

124
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,520
and what happened was the in this in the

125
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,000
case of

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,880
twitter what the they put out like a

127
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,600
message from like a mid-level engineer

128
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,000
basically was the face of the twitter

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,919
hack and he was putting out things that

130
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,240
said

131
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,639
sophisticated social engineering we're

132
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,320
improving awareness and everything like

133
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,800
that

134
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,280
in the case of cloudflare matt prince to

135
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,400
his credit

136
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
came out as the ceo and said we

137
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,400
experienced

138
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
and basically this massive outage

139
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,520
occurred

140
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,560
because an engineer was re you know

141
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,199
basically modifying a routing table

142
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,199
and that engineer made an error in how

143
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,240
they did that

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,120
and somebody replied back on twitter and

145
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,600
said i would hate to be that engineer

146
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,199
and the ceo of cloudflare basically said

147
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,039
you know what it's not the engineer's

148
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,360
fault his quote was

149
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,560
it's a failure of leadership that one

150
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,800
person making one error could take down

151
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,560
our entire network

152
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,120
that is essentially the right answer a

153
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,440
failure of leadership so anyway let's go

154
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560
back to talk about

155
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,400
safety science i'm going to talk first

156
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,639
about old school safety science safety

157
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,639
science a lot of people ignore

158
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,960
in cyber security we think we're the

159
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,160
first profession

160
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,199
ever that had to deal with human error

161
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,039
i hate to break it to a lot of cyber

162
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,720
security people but we're not the

163
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,880
snowflakes we think we are

164
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
just about every profession in the world

165
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,800
has had to deal with human error

166
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,160
of one form or another and old school

167
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,240
safety science because safety science

168
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,639
gets

169
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,960
millions and millions of dollars because

170
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,639
if a person injures themselves in a

171
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,360
factory

172
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,080
the factory could go down if people are

173
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,720
injured

174
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,360
companies get sued hundreds of millions

175
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,440
if not billions of dollars a year

176
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,560
are because people do things that injure

177
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
themselves so safety science came to me

178
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
and initially old school safety science

179
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,160
said if

180
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,800
somebody injured themselves on the job

181
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
why were they stupid enough to injure

182
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,400
themselves on the job that was

183
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,639
old-school safety science it was the

184
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,080
person's fault it was

185
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,360
always an analysis of why the user or

186
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,919
the other person was wrong sorry i hope

187
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,680
everybody's talking back there because

188
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,360
i'm not interesting instead of technical

189
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,479
errors i'd rather have

190
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,800
not interested in technical errors but

191
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,759
anyway so

192
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,080
this is like essentially blaming a

193
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
canary for dying

194
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,560
in a in a coal mine canaries are

195
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,680
supposed to die

196
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,080
in a coal mine they're supposed to die

197
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,599
before people die

198
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,919
because the environment is unsafe

199
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,880
instead in cyber security what do we say

200
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,120
we're like we just need better awareness

201
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,360
we just need funnier awareness we just

202
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,759
need

203
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,800
more entertaining videos again that's

204
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,120
like

205
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,840
saying let's put a gas mask on a canary

206
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,039
in a coal mine

207
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,039
because the problem isn't the level of

208
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,400
awareness the problem

209
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,639
isn't the user the problem is the

210
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,720
environment the users are in

211
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,680
that create all these problems so anyway

212
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,840
let's talk about this as operational

213
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,720
problems

214
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,160
proximity doesn't explain a lot in other

215
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,720
words

216
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,800
let's say for example a bus driver is

217
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,160
driving a bus

218
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,199
and a tire falls off do you blame the

219
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,400
bus driver

220
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,120
well in some rare cases maybe the bus

221
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,199
driver drove over a curb

222
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
into a wall or something like that then

223
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
yes you played the bus driver

224
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
it had certain conditions that there

225
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
were not mechanical errors

226
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,759
generally if a bus driver a wheel falls

227
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
off the bus that's because of poor

228
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,120
maintenance on the bus

229
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,960
poor inspections on the bus and

230
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,240
everything like that

231
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,879
and what they do is they do post-mortems

232
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,960
in the medical profession for example

233
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,599
every time somebody dies in a hospital

234
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,599
the hospital sits down on a regular

235
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,319
basis

236
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,599
and says okay why in the last week these

237
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,000
people

238
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,960
died what could we have done better was

239
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,639
there some malfeasance

240
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,280
or were there a series of errors that

241
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,000
occurred

242
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,759
somebody actually went through safety

243
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,360
science people looked at the medical

244
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,160
profession

245
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,000
and they determined that for example

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
when people die in surgery because of

247
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,599
what's considered

248
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,520
and error by the doctor doing the

249
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
surgery they found why did the doctor

250
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,200
do that specific act and at the time the

251
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,679
doctor

252
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,479
did that specific act in general it was

253
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,000
the right decision

254
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,080
the problem was there was a chain of

255
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,600
events before that

256
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
which led to that decision being made

257
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,760
and they had to look back in the chain

258
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,279
of events and say okay

259
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,399
early on in that chain of events what

260
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,680
could have been done different

261
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,080
that the doctor wouldn't have made that

262
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,800
decision

263
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,440
at that point which led to the death and

264
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,600
that requires a full postmortem from

265
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,720
start to finish

266
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,959
as to what happened in every step along

267
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,880
the way when we look at new school

268
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
safety science which took this into

269
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,519
account

270
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,160
you know they're essentially the user is

271
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,600
really just the process

272
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
and i'm using cyber security now i'm

273
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,640
going to transition

274
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
and make parallels between safety

275
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,800
science and cyber security

276
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,040
pretty much a user is just part of the

277
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
system a user is not i

278
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,080
frankly awareness is awesome but

279
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,160
awareness professionals are well meaning

280
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,720
but sometimes they have this poly and of

281
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,000
you hopefully pollyanna

282
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,800
translates i think it's a european story

283
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,640
but you know they have this idealistic

284
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,760
view of the user

285
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,160
we want to make the user you know the

286
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
paragon of virtue and everything

287
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,320
that's just not going to happen a user

288
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,000
no matter how much you

289
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,480
think of them is still just a part of

290
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,600
the system

291
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,839
much like a bus driver is part of the

292
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,120
bus essentially

293
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
much like any of those sorry doctors

294
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,279
part of a surgery team

295
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,519
they're just a part of the system and

296
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,920
what they realize is that a safety suck

297
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,440
in safety science

298
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
if the user makes a mistake that's a

299
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,760
failure of the whole system

300
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,079
because the user just didn't magically

301
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,040
come into being

302
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,839
and make an error the user was put in a

303
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,480
system

304
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,959
that presented the user with a condition

305
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,440
and the user acted on the condition

306
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,680
maybe it was a lack of awareness maybe

307
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,000
it was you know a malice whatever it

308
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,959
happened to be

309
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,839
the user failed in their thing would set

310
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,600
off the chain of events that caused the

311
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,560
failure

312
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,120
now what they do is they review all

313
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,480
enabling factors

314
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,720
and again it uses just the proximity of

315
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,800
the error and the proximity is just a

316
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,519
symptom

317
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,839
of the overall problem with the system

318
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,399
like ransomware the problem is not the

319
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,640
user clicked on the message why was the

320
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,000
user stupid enough

321
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,560
to click on ransomware the thing was why

322
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,399
did the system fail that allowed

323
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,720
ransomware to lock up the whole network

324
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
and again user error is just the symptom

325
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,519
what's wrong

326
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,320
so uh well most people would not know

327
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,880
this but

328
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,360
i am certified as a master scuba diver

329
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,920
trainer

330
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,320
i love scuba diving i can't go scuba

331
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,519
diving at the moment but

332
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,240
such is life so anyway this the reason i

333
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,680
have this picture this is

334
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,160
actually what i'm assuming is a training

335
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,839
a certification class

336
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,680
where they're doing an exercise known as

337
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,240
a fin pivot in a thin pivot basically

338
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,120
you just

339
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,519
show you can go up and down having

340
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,040
neutral buoyancy

341
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,440
and what happens is this is likely the

342
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,959
instructor over here

343
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,800
and that instructor as you see is

344
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,399
watching that now

345
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,079
when you stop and think about the first

346
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,240
time i ever heard this expression

347
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,600
you can't stop stupid was when i was

348
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,440
going through scuba instructor training

349
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
the courses the course director

350
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,000
basically said

351
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,920
you can't stop stupid and i was sitting

352
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,760
there thinking wait a second this

353
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,959
whole class i'm taking is essentially

354
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,639
how to stop stupid

355
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,320
you know when you look at scuba diving

356
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
because scuba diving there's

357
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,000
countless ways you can kill yourself

358
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,519
literally countless ways

359
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,079
i've done it myself on many occasions

360
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,360
well not as any

361
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,880
as an instructor i should say i've never

362
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,480
done it but the reality is

363
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,200
i've done some stupid things but when

364
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,760
you stop

365
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,160
and look at the diet industry the diet

366
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,639
industry relies upon people living

367
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,720
and what they've done is scuba say you

368
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,079
know scuba skills

369
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,720
aren't taught by you know paddy's

370
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,440
professional

371
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,320
association of diving instructors ssi a

372
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,200
few others

373
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,880
and all these organizations have

374
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480
basically gone through

375
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,560
a whole bunch of diet injuries and

376
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,880
figured out why do these diet injuries

377
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,040
happen we need them not to happen

378
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,279
because we need a safe dive industry and

379
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,880
nobody will go diving

380
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,800
so you basically look at the scuba

381
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
skills and they're taught

382
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,600
before a student comes into my class

383
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,760
they have to go through and they have to

384
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,279
essentially take a medical

385
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,639
to make sure that they're not going to

386
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,560
die of a heart attack or something

387
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
then we put them in a pool and they're

388
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,639
supposed to swim a little bit and float

389
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,360
a little bit

390
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,040
we don't really care if you can swim

391
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,360
that's what all the dive equipment's for

392
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,519
then the reality is we just care you're

393
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,120
not going to freak out in water because

394
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,040
freaking out in water is what really

395
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,959
kills people at the end of the day

396
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,600
so we need to make sure that then before

397
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,320
they actually

398
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,560
go in the water they have to take like

399
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,839
dozens of hours

400
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,320
of training on how not to kill

401
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,040
themselves

402
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,639
then when we put them in the water we

403
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,639
check all their equipment they we teach

404
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,240
them to check their equipment

405
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,160
and then we go ahead and put them in a

406
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,600
shallow end of the pool

407
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,000
and slowly take them deeper then what we

408
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,760
know they can do everything we need them

409
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,480
to do

410
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,360
in you know in the real world then we

411
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
take them to the real world in a very

412
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,120
you know like for example you can see

413
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
the bubbles are going straight up which

414
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,480
says there really is an occurring

415
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,399
you know reasonably good visibility and

416
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,839
all that sort of stuff

417
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,800
but the thing you know like this person

418
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
could only go ahead and look at one

419
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,079
person at a time

420
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,480
but click the button please what you

421
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,360
don't see here

422
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,959
is and you can barely see this i'm

423
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,880
thinking here is there was this another

424
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,480
person that they brought along

425
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
as an assistant instructor or dive

426
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,839
master to watch

427
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,600
the rest of the people to make sure

428
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,519
these people don't kill themselves in

429
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,560
the process

430
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,360
i was once that instructor and what

431
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,240
happened was

432
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,560
one of the people over here decided hey

433
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,360
what's actually under the platform

434
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,279
and look i caught them in the corner of

435
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,959
my eye but luckily the assistant

436
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,040
instructor was pulling them out before i

437
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,600
did

438
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,839
that people will do stupid things but

439
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,000
anyway even if they do stupid things we

440
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
know where the hospitals are the

441
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
barometric chambers are

442
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,360
you know have insurance on everybody and

443
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,800
so on but anyway

444
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,880
that's diving and the reason i put that

445
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,120
there there should be a lot of parallels

446
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,000
to house

447
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,560
how safe diving is compared to cyber

448
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,600
security

449
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,079
so anyway where does blame actually fall

450
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,920
in safety science they've gone ahead and

451
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,240
done a lot of things and figured out hey

452
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,560
why do people injure themselves on the

453
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,839
job

454
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,800
90 percent of that turns out to be the

455
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,959
environment that the people are in

456
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,959
for example i work you know when i do

457
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,360
awareness programs for large companies

458
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,279
sometimes there's a factory or

459
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,680
manufacturing areas and things like that

460
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,600
i walked around with safety science

461
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,519
people and one time they were showing me

462
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,120
you see this yellow line on the floor

463
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,279
we were walking around the warehouse and

464
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,160
they said

465
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,639
we used to have approximately 100

466
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,920
injuries a year

467
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,880
where forklifts were driving into people

468
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,560
walking through the factory

469
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
and we did all these studies and finally

470
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,000
we figured out we're going to draw a

471
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,480
line

472
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,120
on the floor and people stay to one side

473
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,199
forklift stay to the other side

474
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,399
and that took care of almost every

475
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,880
injury resulting from forklifts and

476
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,759
other things

477
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,800
and what happened was they still had an

478
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
injury every so often and when they did

479
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,560
that they figured out well that was a

480
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,160
person on their iphone

481
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,480
walking down and and accidentally

482
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,320
burying into the wrong side

483
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
or a driver not paying attention on

484
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,480
their iphone crashing into people

485
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
so these things happen but generally 90

486
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,720
is the environment around the user you

487
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,279
know

488
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,320
10 is the user themselves because think

489
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,040
about it

490
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,759
can a user actually click on ransomware

491
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,600
if it's not in their inbox

492
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,920
you know nobody thinks of that one so

493
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
what is the other 10

494
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,240
and you got to look at the 10 the 10

495
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,480
includes carelessness it might include

496
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,040
blatant ignorance it could be a lack of

497
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,759
training

498
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,279
something else a lot of people don't

499
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,800
consider is malice

500
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,399
and this is something like when people

501
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,839
say we need more awareness for

502
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,279
ransomware

503
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,360
if you if you think you know more

504
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,440
awareness is the complete solution

505
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,759
you're going to get your organization

506
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,560
killed

507
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,800
because malice according to the verizon

508
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,000
data breach report

509
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,040
was responsible for 28 of all attacks in

510
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,959
a recent day i can't remember which year

511
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,800
it wasn't the latest at every the latest

512
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,320
they're all essentially the same thing

513
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,240
with slightly different numbers you all

514
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,959
know that

515
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,279
but anyway this is where awareness and

516
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,320
training might fit in that last 10

517
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,119
but still it's only ten percent of the

518
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,679
overall

519
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,319
problem that awareness can satisfy this

520
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,559
means as cyber security people we gotta

521
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,240
figure out how to address that ninety

522
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,039
percent

523
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,599
so now i've talked about safety science

524
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,000
before let's talk counterterrorism

525
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,480
and counter-terrorism there's a concept

526
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,679
they call boom

527
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,119
boom is actually the attack itself

528
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,000
and so then you have people

529
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,280
professionals who

530
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,679
encounter terrorism that specialize in

531
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,480
left the boom

532
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,720
and ridicule if you think about it on

533
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,840
the timeline

534
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,559
from let the boom starts when terrorists

535
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,160
are planning the attacks

536
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,320
writing boom is after the attack how do

537
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,360
you respond

538
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,320
and try to prepare the organization so

539
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,000
what is boom essentially like i said

540
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
counter terrorism strategy

541
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,919
but left the boom includes prevention

542
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,120
and protection

543
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,039
right boom is response recovery

544
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,240
resiliency

545
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,400
so if we're talking about prevention and

546
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,280
protection

547
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,200
prevention might be for example the

548
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,520
people in terrorism who specialize

549
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,760
in identifying potential terrorists

550
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,039
trying to hunt them down

551
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,440
trying to stop them whatever protection

552
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,480
other people

553
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,320
they don't really know exactly who the

554
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,520
terrorists are they're not going to

555
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,160
necessarily

556
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,320
stop them but they're responsible for

557
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,400
example for hardening buildings

558
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,080
they'll stay there they'll be like okay

559
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,320
i need to have an evacuation plan i need

560
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,960
to have

561
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
like cement pillars in front of

562
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,320
buildings and so on

563
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,000
but those people specialize in

564
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,160
protection while other people

565
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,240
specialize in stopping the attacks from

566
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,080
happening in the first place

567
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
then we have at the point of whom boom

568
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
at the point of boom is like how do you

569
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,200
hard in a facility so if we're going

570
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,400
back well it's almost

571
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,960
ancient history these days 20 years to

572
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
the september 11th attacks

573
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,640
everybody remembers the world trade

574
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,960
center attack because it's very visible

575
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,799
terrorists really care primarily about

576
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,240
visibility you know

577
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,960
having images of like towers falls one

578
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,440
thing

579
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,360
a lot of people don't remember that the

580
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,760
pentagon was attacked on the same day

581
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,120
now that sounds bad but the way i say it

582
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,520
only about 100 people were killed inside

583
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
the pentagon when they flew a plane in

584
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,559
the building but a good

585
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,960
portion of that was because they

586
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,600
actually

587
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,480
hardened the pentagon before the attack

588
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,320
just because they were concerned about a

589
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,840
bomb going off inside

590
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,760
so they hardened the walls they put more

591
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,120
fire protection

592
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
so when the plane actually went in it

593
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,360
actually caused very limited damage

594
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,120
to what it could have been because the

595
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,039
whole building was harder

596
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,120
so anyway that's at the point of whom

597
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,480
you can do things like that

598
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,400
strength and concrete doors and so on or

599
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
another example

600
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,080
then in response recovery and resiliency

601
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,160
you have to for example train first

602
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,360
responders

603
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,679
not to rush right into an environment

604
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,240
because it sounds counterintuitive but

605
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,919
if there's poisonous deaths in the

606
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,600
environment that there's radiation or

607
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,039
biological weapons

608
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,720
there's the potential for secondary

609
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
explosion so you have to know how to

610
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,840
respond quickly

611
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,200
you have to make sure there's a

612
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
hospitals in the area enough hospitals

613
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,280
to take care of the concerns and so on

614
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,640
and they have to figure out how to

615
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,480
rebuild when we look at these

616
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,600
principles for cyber security i came up

617
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,799
with a concept of

618
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,600
what i call user initiated loss because

619
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
at the end of the day a user doesn't

620
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
cause the damage

621
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,679
even if the user clicks on ransomware

622
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,200
the user doesn't go

623
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,640
into a hard drive and encrypt every bit

624
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,440
the computer encrypts every bit of the

625
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,880
computer itself

626
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,720
the computer is essentially committing

627
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
suicide the user doesn't do it the user

628
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,480
just takes an

629
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,039
action that results in there just

630
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,320
because the user does something it

631
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,240
doesn't mean it has to do something

632
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,640
and also i'd say user initiated loss

633
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,000
instead of user error

634
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
because again likewise it might be

635
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,039
malice

636
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,840
it could be not a lack of awareness i

637
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
mean it could be the user intends to do

638
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,280
something it could be that

639
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,880
you know the user just wants to do

640
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
something that's wrong but either way

641
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,799
i'd like to take out the cause and cause

642
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,799
it user initiated loss

643
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,799
but acknowledge that the user again is

644
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,720
just initiating the loss

645
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,039
and again it just creates the

646
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,039
possibility of a loss that doesn't have

647
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,080
to be realized

648
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
could be ignorance if you want to stop

649
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,000
the potential for the loss in other

650
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,760
words you want to do something

651
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,919
like the boom and then you want to stop

652
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,320
the actual initiation of the loss which

653
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,919
comes out to right of course

654
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,520
but then you want to mitigate the loss

655
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,240
afterwards again assuming that the loss

656
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,880
did occur in some way so when we start

657
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,799
talking about user-initiated laws from

658
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,400
the left to boom perspective

659
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,240
you want to really stop the user from

660
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,919
being in the position to click on things

661
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,799
if we're talking

662
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,559
ransomware you don't want to put

663
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,480
ransomware in the user's box

664
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,559
you want to block the user for example

665
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,320
from going to websites that might be

666
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,679
dangerous and so on

667
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,440
so perhaps you want to take away

668
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,520
capability of decision making

669
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,960
a lot of people like no we want to

670
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,559
empower the users no you don't

671
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,640
you want the users to do just the things

672
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,840
they need to do

673
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,720
with the capabilities they need to do it

674
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,440
you know

675
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,600
protection detection reaction you will

676
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,159
need to create a culture of consequences

677
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,559
and a lot of people say well gee no we

678
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,240
don't want to blame the user it's like

679
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,120
you know users are limited you got to

680
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,240
acknowledge that

681
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,720
users are busy users have a variety of

682
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,840
different issues to

683
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
you know address but you want to

684
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,520
essentially create a culture where they

685
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,760
do the right things i tell the story

686
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,559
when i worked in nsa you know i worked

687
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,559
in national security agency for people

688
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:27,440
who don't know

689
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
and there was one time i was working

690
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,600
shift work and this guy working with me

691
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,400
uh well he's irrelevant until i start

692
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,600
telling this story but

693
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,080
i was working on this plotter that threw

694
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,039
maps out

695
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,520
and i had to take my badge off because

696
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,480
the plotter would

697
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,159
you know wrap the badge up if you didn't

698
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,840
have safety of course

699
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,600
and then what happened was i had to run

700
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,880
to the toilet

701
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,520
and i basically ran out to the toilet

702
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,520
forgot my bandage which i realized when

703
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,679
i ran into a security guard in the hall

704
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,200
doing his rounds

705
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,880
and the car's like where's your pants i

706
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,280
go right

707
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,120
probably on my desk he's like we're

708
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,720
going to your desk and i'm like

709
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,360
you're not allowed anywhere near my desk

710
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,440
so anyways like i'll wait by the door

711
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,919
so i go he waits by the door go to my

712
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:12,640
desk

713
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,240
and all of a sudden i'm like looking

714
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,000
around can't find the badge

715
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,919
and my co-worker said are you looking

716
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,440
for something i don't know

717
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,080
like where is my so i don't want to

718
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,280
curse on youtube

719
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,360
i don't know why but anyway i go where's

720
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,600
my fm badge and all of a sudden the

721
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,000
guard

722
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,080
you know and the guy said the guard's

723
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,000
like is there a problem yelling from the

724
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,559
door

725
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,960
and i'm like and finally the guy do you

726
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,600
think i ever forgot that badge again

727
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,000
you know that was a culture where again

728
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,840
everything was put in place

729
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,919
the guards were doing rounds and all

730
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,120
that sort of stuff

731
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,360
next is governance and this is a part

732
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,200
that a lot of people ignore

733
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
governance everybody thinks okay write

734
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,320
policies

735
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,799
procedures basically most organizations

736
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,760
treat it like

737
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,520
they write these documents they get put

738
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,919
on the shelf and so the auditor shows up

739
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,440
they take them off the shelf the order

740
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,520
says okay great you have a policy you're

741
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,240
done

742
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,760
you know but government should really

743
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,559
define how an organization does things

744
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,240
from start to finish

745
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,640
you know what is the policy what do

746
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,200
people what are people supposed to do it

747
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
every step along the way

748
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,880
you don't normally see that done in a

749
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,400
lot of organizations

750
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,559
in other words how is it like you always

751
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,679
tell people

752
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,720
make sure that it's not from a hacker

753
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,120
make sure that this is it's like they

754
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,279
never tell people how to do that

755
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,440
they basically just say check an email

756
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,679
they don't say how for example

757
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,760
but anyway the user actions are there by

758
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,520
default you have to make sure you

759
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,360
document these actions

760
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,120
and that's what's left out in a lot of

761
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,760
cases so at the point of boom

762
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
the user at this case you know we're

763
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,679
talking about the users presented with

764
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,760
the opportunity to initiate a loss

765
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,080
we could be talking about phishing and

766
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,039
ransomware

767
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,960
we could be talking about usb drops we

768
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,320
could be talking about a

769
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,440
user filling in an email address and it

770
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,600
could be the wrong address or so on

771
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,320
but either way they have the opportunity

772
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,840
what do they do do they do it for

773
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,760
detected do they present

774
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,080
prevent it do they sound the alarm and

775
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
remember this can be from any cause

776
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,159
whether it's accident careless willful

777
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,520
malicious whatever

778
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,600
because think about it a lot of people

779
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,559
could say oh

780
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,080
you know somebody shows up and they

781
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,919
might want to send the message to the

782
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,039
wrong michael

783
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,720
and they might be emailing out for

784
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,240
example critical design

785
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
documents and then you go to the first

786
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,440
oh yeah no i

787
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,679
i meant the other michael not the one i

788
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,600
not the criminal i sent it to

789
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,760
you know i mean those things happen but

790
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
it really doesn't matter why they wanted

791
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,520
to send it to the wrong michael or

792
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,240
whether it was an

793
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,279
accident or on purpose so anyway this is

794
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,799
the point that the user

795
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,679
has the opportunity what do they do

796
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,520
what's the guidance on how to do this

797
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,400
and so on

798
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,640
so and here's policies and governance

799
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,440
again

800
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,400
i love awareness but i simultaneously

801
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,159
hate how it's practiced i'll give you

802
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:00,799
that

803
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,320
and what i mean by that is we're

804
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,400
generally do people know element blood

805
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
here in greece

806
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,919
okay people know elmore but if you don't

807
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,919
know apparently there's a new space jam

808
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:10,640
movie

809
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,440
because shaquille o'neal is out and kobe

810
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,559
bryant is in

811
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,159
but anyway there's a new space chat

812
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,480
movie with elmer bucks elmer fudd was

813
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,960
always on the lookout for bugs funny

814
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,440
trying to hunt bugs funny and if both

815
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
bunny would put on a dress

816
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,760
elbert bud would never recognize bugs

817
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,480
funny

818
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,120
it was that bad and that made it funny

819
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,080
for some reason

820
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,320
but the reality is that's our users

821
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,240
they're all we're training them

822
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,760
how to look out somebody gets an email

823
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,919
and they remember the big o is this that

824
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,320
hacker i saw in the video trying to

825
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,360
trick me

826
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,760
or is this really the ceo of the company

827
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,840
who needs something desperately

828
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,559
and it's like you don't want this case

829
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,919
you don't want because

830
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,919
here's the concept when you're looking

831
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,679
at an email a lot of them look

832
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,080
amateurist but you're basically taking

833
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,440
your lowest level user and putting them

834
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,400
at odds

835
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,360
with a potentially untrained sociopath

836
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,640
organized crime

837
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,480
you know we saw the shadow brokers and

838
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,320
the nutshell

839
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,039
what was the latest one a dark side with

840
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,120
the colonial pipeline incident

841
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,039
and all those things these people are

842
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,279
still criminals they're gonna find a way

843
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,960
to trick people

844
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,120
but you gotta go ahead and tell the

845
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,760
users how to do things the right way

846
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,720
not what to be afraid of and then you

847
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,760
know gotta figure out

848
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,679
are all their actions necessary tell

849
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,919
them what actions are necessary what or

850
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:36,559
not

851
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,600
but don't rely upon the user as your

852
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,120
first line of defense

853
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,720
your user is not your first line of

854
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,799
defense your users not your last line of

855
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,440
defense

856
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,360
and if they are you have failed as a

857
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,799
security professional

858
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,760
so right a loss has been initiated but

859
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,440
the good part is just because somebody

860
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
initiates a loss doesn't mean the loss

861
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,720
has to be realized

862
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,880
does the environment expect it for

863
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,200
example if the users don't have admin

864
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,000
privileges

865
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,520
they might not be able to download

866
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,200
malware if there's

867
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,600
empty malware on the system ransomware

868
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,919
should not be able to load in general

869
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,279
you know are there additional

870
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,279
protections for example is there daily

871
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,640
prevention

872
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,840
are there behavioral um and behavioral

873
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,360
based empty malware

874
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,640
to try to stop ransomware once it starts

875
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,279
running

876
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,080
that stop systems from encrypting itself

877
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,679
and then also write a boom

878
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,080
do you go back and go ahead and analyze

879
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,720
incidents

880
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
after the fact to figure out why these

881
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,640
things happen was it a failure of

882
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,279
policies was it a failure of technology

883
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,360
was it a value of awareness or whatever

884
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,440
else maybe you can have your users do

885
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,679
more additional things and so on

886
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,520
here's essentially a mapping i went

887
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,279
ahead and you know hopefully i don't

888
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:47,840
think

889
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,919
i apologize to the people in the room

890
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,520
it's a bad angle for this

891
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,919
but i went ahead and mapped out what has

892
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:54,960
to happen

893
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,760
for a phishing message to be successful

894
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,000
and

895
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,399
from start to finish and when you look

896
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,080
at this what happens is and i'll

897
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,920
hopefully

898
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,880
[Music]

899
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,240
just happen okay anyway so what happens

900
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,000
is a malicious actor they have to start

901
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,120
with a body

902
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,600
and somehow the entire security

903
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,279
community on the internet

904
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,000
has to allow that botnet to exist then

905
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,320
they

906
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,720
send an email message out the message

907
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,559
goes to a perimeter device and if the

908
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,559
perimeter device for example is running

909
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,440
dmarc

910
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,200
you might be able to prevent that

911
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,960
message from getting any further because

912
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,240
the site comes from

913
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,320
was unauthenticated as it was from the

914
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
sentence so the

915
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,080
the sender then from the perimeter

916
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,000
device it goes to the mail server the

917
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,880
actual mail

918
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,200
server itself if the mail server is

919
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,799
running good anti-malware

920
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,880
mail service running good anti-spams and

921
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,880
other things again the mail server

922
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,240
should potentially should

923
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,120
directly stop the message from getting

924
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,080
any further

925
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,600
but if the mail server um fails

926
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
then it gets to the email client then

927
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,440
the email client frankly

928
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,679
should stop the message itself but if

929
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,440
the email client doesn't stop the

930
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,080
message

931
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,240
then you have it either goes to an inbox

932
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
or a spam box on things like outlook or

933
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,080
other email clients

934
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,799
and then it becomes a user interface

935
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,120
then the user at this point basically

936
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,559
has to decide

937
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,320
whether or not the user has to decide

938
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,159
whether or not they actually want to go

939
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,399
ahead and open a message but it's a

940
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,240
different user experience if it's in its

941
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,960
inbox

942
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
because it might be assumed to be safe

943
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,799
while something in the spam box

944
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,200
should be assumed to be not saved and so

945
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,840
on

946
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,720
but anyway then the user now makes the

947
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,600
decision

948
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,520
and the user in that environment should

949
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,600
have nudges maybe that includes a little

950
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,080
signs

951
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,240
maybe that includes like banners a lot

952
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,320
of a lot of email servers now but

953
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,279
banners say

954
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,840
this comes from outside the company

955
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,360
there's a lot of companies now working

956
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,600
on nudges they us have awareness

957
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,720
where hopefully policies be procedures

958
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,320
where the procedures then be the

959
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,399
awareness efforts and so on

960
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,279
and then the user then has that then

961
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,440
once the user makes their decision

962
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,720
they take an action now hopefully if

963
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,480
hopefully they don't take the action but

964
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,919
if they take the action

965
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,679
there's a lot of user interfaces now

966
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,159
that say hey that message goes to

967
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,640
that link goes to an unsafe site that

968
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,200
message

969
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,640
might you know do you really want to

970
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,880
open this message up it looks dangerous

971
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,840
and so on

972
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,440
and then the user should be able to go

973
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,519
ahead and say no well let's say the user

974
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,480
says screw it

975
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,120
i want to go ahead and enter that or

976
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,080
look at that message

977
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,720
anyway and take the action in that case

978
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
you should have anti-malware filters

979
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,120
you should have or or what i'm sorry

980
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,000
this then

981
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,159
what are the three potential actions

982
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,240
usually for phishing messages

983
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,919
they might want to load malware like

984
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,000
ransomware they might want you to send

985
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,679
out sensitive materials or they might

986
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,559
want to compromise

987
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,720
credentials like say log on to this

988
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,120
website and enter your email credentials

989
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,679
so then what happens if there's malware

990
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,039
first thing that should happen are

991
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,000
permissions

992
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,919
that user doesn't have permission to

993
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,360
download files and

994
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,559
install software for example and then if

995
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,240
that fails then there should be empty

996
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,919
malware on the system that says

997
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,919
we're not going to let you load this

998
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,679
file because this file's malware

999
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,960
on the other hand let's say there's

1000
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,720
sensitive materials and it asks

1001
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
please send out your latest documents or

1002
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
your tax forms or whatever

1003
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,000
and that should go into daily prevention

1004
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,760
maybe the user doesn't have permission

1005
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
to access the positive question

1006
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,000
daily prevention should also stop it

1007
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,760
compromise credentials there should be

1008
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,840
web content filters that say hey wait a

1009
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,399
second

1010
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,480
you're not going to a legitimate log on

1011
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,080
site as an example

1012
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,320
and this all should mitigate this but

1013
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,279
when you look at it

1014
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,760
the user just takes one action here

1015
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,799
after the one

1016
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,919
for loss to be realized basically

1017
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,240
your whole technology infrastructure has

1018
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,000
to fail to begin with

1019
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,919
and then you have to have a really bad

1020
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,159
technology infrastructure to allow

1021
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,640
all that to be realized so when you look

1022
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,720
at user security engineering i kind of

1023
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,880
came up with a model of visualizing it

1024
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,559
one of my friends said to call this a

1025
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,000
bow tie and say

1026
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,159
because what has to happen is governance

1027
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,799
should drive your entire infrastructure

1028
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,720
governance should say here is

1029
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,000
specifically

1030
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,640
what my security policies are here's the

1031
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,880
technology i need and so on

1032
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,960
and so what happens is government speeds

1033
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,880
the technology infrastructure like the

1034
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,480
perimeter devices

1035
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,399
then you have the endpoint technology

1036
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,000
endpoint technologies might include

1037
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,120
anti-malware

1038
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,640
includes permissions it includes

1039
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
whatever else there is to stop users

1040
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,760
from doing stuff

1041
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,880
then you have what this example user

1042
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,600
experience user experience is how our

1043
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,840
input power is information presented to

1044
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,720
the user

1045
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,960
how can you go ahead and tell the user

1046
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,799
this is potentially harmful

1047
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,640
lead the users to the right decisions

1048
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,799
with a series of nudges and awareness

1049
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,960
then the user takes the action but at

1050
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,039
the same time once the user takes the

1051
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:55,919
action

1052
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,760
it should have to go through all these

1053
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,279
layers on the way out

1054
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,919
so for example the system should say hey

1055
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,080
wait a second that's not a good idea do

1056
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,159
you really want to still do it then the

1057
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,079
user says yeah i still want to do it

1058
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,000
then the endpoint technology should say

1059
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,440
no you're not allowed

1060
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,359
and if the endpoint technology allows

1061
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,918
them the technology infrastructure like

1062
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,280
daily prevention

1063
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,918
like all anti-malware on hard storage

1064
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:20,879
drives can

1065
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,440
or sorry all anti-malware on all the

1066
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
drives around the organization are

1067
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,520
protected themselves and so on

1068
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,440
and again governance then goes back and

1069
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,199
figures out why did the attack get as

1070
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,399
far as it did

1071
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,599
so most important takeaway your user is

1072
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,440
essentially just your canary in the coal

1073
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,000
mine

1074
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,639
they're not really aware of security if

1075
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,239
the user fails

1076
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,639
you know the user fails it's a problem

1077
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,359
with your whole

1078
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,520
system you know they're not your first

1079
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,960
line of defense or your last line

1080
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,599
defense

1081
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,520
they essentially are a part of the

1082
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,839
system and if they do something wrong

1083
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,918
it's a failure of the system as a whole

1084
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,359
so anyway everybody should buy my

1085
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,160
awesome book

1086
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,040
people here it looks like some people

1087
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,160
will get my book

1088
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:10,560
and that's me any questions
