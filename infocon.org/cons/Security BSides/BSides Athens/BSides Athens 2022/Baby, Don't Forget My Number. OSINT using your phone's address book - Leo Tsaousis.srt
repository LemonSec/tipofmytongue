1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,399
hello everyone thank you for joining

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,000
this presentation welcome back to

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,080
besides athens my name is leo and today

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,360
we're going to talk about open source

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,240
intelligence or austin

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,400
first off some words about myself i've

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,840
been around in the industry for a bit

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,000
over six years i'm a security consultant

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,080
and researcher in the past of also

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,080
companies like f-secure which was once

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,760
called mwr and it's now known as

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,560
websecure and nso group which i'm pretty

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
sure you all know at the moment however

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
i'm serving my country in the hellenic

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,120
army cyber defense department and you

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,040
can find me on twitter github and all

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,680
the things as ali ripping

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,440
today i want to talk about an auction

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,000
trick which is one of my favorites it is

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,320
a known one so don't expect any novel

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,239
techniques or zero days

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,559
and it's extremely easy and surprisingly

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,719
effective for its purpose we'll refer to

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,640
it as contact sync

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
first we'll see what it is and why we

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,440
need it

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,359
then we'll go about the challenges of

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
creating fake accounts or sock puppets

29
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,000
specifically phone-backed ones which is

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,880
a pain depending on where you live in

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,560
then we look at operational security

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,880
considerations or opsec and what

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,799
automation capabilities we have or

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,360
rather what are the limitations

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,960
and we'll summarize with an evaluation

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,119
of this technique it's pros and cons

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,080
compared to other tricks

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,040
okay

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,880
imagine you walk up to your phone to

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,720
realize you've missed the call and the

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
number doesn't look familiar so

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,320
naturally you want to see if it's

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,479
something important or not to maybe call

44
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,360
it back

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,880
maybe it's your boss maybe you've worn

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,400
an all-exclusive trip to the greek

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,360
islands it could happen right who knows

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,360
this is a typical awesome scenario where

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,200
we start with an unknown phone number

50
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,920
and want to get more intel about it

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,079
something you might also see mentioned

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,880
as an enrichment process

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,960
this problem can of course be tackled

54
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,119
with many ways we can see some of them

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,040
in this excellent diagram from intel

56
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,119
techniques a great great source of such

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,159
diagrams

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,000
which essentially presents the awesome

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,399
landscape for this scenario

60
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,640
the path will follow is also covered and

61
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,479
it's the highlighted one it involves a

62
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,360
mobile operating system a smartphone and

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
your contacts your address book as we

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,080
can see

65
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
but we'll get to it in detail in the

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,119
next slide

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,120
so let's see what our solution looks

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,680
like we'll start with a target number

69
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
we'll need any smartphone

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,080
to add this number to our contacts and

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,640
then using social media and instant

72
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,120
messaging applications we will upload

73
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,239
this address book to find friends that

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,160
might take restarting the app rebooting

75
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
the device or just refreshing the main

76
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,200
screen and boom we get some new data for

77
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,879
the target typically a name in the

78
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,599
picture sometimes also the last active

79
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,800
status

80
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,640
and not just from one application one

81
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,400
service as we refer to them the cool

82
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
thing here is that you can do the same

83
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,480
thing with multiple apps and get more

84
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,959
data a different pick a new name

85
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,400
or even different types of data

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,159
altogether to slowly enrich your target

87
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,560
awesome how do we start

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,159
first you guessed it we need a

89
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,280
smartphone

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
but why not use a virtual machine or an

91
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,200
emulator you might ask

92
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,360
the challenge with with these is that to

93
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
even install the apps of interest

94
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,040
sometimes we'll need to hide the

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
emulation environment or evade wood

96
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,879
detection routines

97
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,040
and this can get complicated with lots

98
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,280
of custom mitigations employed by these

99
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,680
apps to prevent abuse this whole topic

100
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,840
is massive in bibliography and at the

101
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,920
end of the day yes the reverser always

102
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,080
wins but overall it's pretty time

103
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,560
consuming so it's best if we can avoid

104
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,080
this trouble altogether

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
and though the reason an emulator might

106
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,840
not be the best idea is that it's

107
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,599
trickier to simulate

108
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,000
telco functionality the phone part of

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,519
the smartphone

110
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,159
for instance we cannot insert a sim

111
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,560
we cannot accept sms messages for

112
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,879
verification codes so it's just easier

113
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,599
to use a smartphone

114
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,280
then we'll need of course a sim card to

115
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,959
create our soft puppet account which

116
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,439
we'll be searching target numbers from

117
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,360
in some countries this is fairly simple

118
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,760
as you don't need to provide any id to

119
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,599
activate sim cards in cyprus for

120
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,840
instance you can just fetch a dozen

121
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
of sim cards from your local mini market

122
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,440
and then you're good to go no questions

123
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,320
asked

124
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,079
in other countries though like greece

125
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,520
you need to provide a whole lot of

126
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,919
personal info to get yourself a number

127
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,600
in the name of national security

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,639
all right

129
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,639
say we have no problem with that the

130
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,680
first obvious place to get this new sim

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,800
card

132
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,040
is the local telco provider brands

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,440
unfortunately this solution isn't really

134
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,120
good because it's just too expensive i

135
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,840
found out that for all prepaid plans you

136
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,400
need to first top up this number that

137
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,960
you're going to use which is at least 12

138
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
euros for the first charge and that's a

139
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
hefty price to conduct any large scale

140
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,280
operations it just doesn't scale up

141
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,160
so

142
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,520
this solution was abandoned

143
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,080
note however that you can also go

144
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,400
shopping in dozier places and get your

145
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
hands on dirty sim cards without really

146
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,639
providing any details or paying anything

147
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,080
so long as you know what you're doing

148
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,240
and be prepared to get scams

149
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,120
like i was as the sim cards that i

150
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,960
obtained through this method were

151
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,160
expired and very smartly restarted as

152
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
brand new

153
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
what about these promotional offers on

154
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,479
subway stations

155
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,560
these youngsters selling three numbers

156
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
loaded with data plans

157
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,199
no that doesn't work either as it turns

158
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,680
out they're not really free and actually

159
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,160
need the same pricey first charts like

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
the install ones

161
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,240
now someone might suggest using an

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,520
online service like twilio to set up uh

163
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,120
to sign up get some phone numbers

164
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,280
receive the registration otps in them

165
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,520
and get cracking with the applications

166
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
what's wrong with this

167
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,199
uh first

168
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,120
you bump into this

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
chicken and egg problem

170
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,800
as to verify yourself in twilio for

171
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
instance you need to first provide

172
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,319
another number your real number and the

173
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,479
whole point is to just hide this real

174
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,840
number right

175
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,840
what's worse is that even if we decide

176
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
to provide this real number

177
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,360
we'll soon find out that we can't really

178
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,800
use it to register on on applications as

179
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,960
they somehow detect this is not the real

180
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,360
number i've just used

181
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,319
and the sms message for the registration

182
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,199
just never comes in so that failed too

183
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,840
next i tried a foreign number kindly

184
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
sponsored by a close friend

185
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,319
but that also failed as apparently it's

186
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,319
a pretty common requirement globally to

187
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,639
frequently top up your balance or it's

188
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,199
just deactivated all together

189
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,759
so another thing to keep in mind for any

190
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,919
awesome operations is that

191
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,160
we'll need to actively maintain any

192
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,880
stock puppets we create

193
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,520
so finally uh disappointed as i was

194
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,919
under the cfp time pressure i decided to

195
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,400
get back to the shop but right before i

196
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
gave up and

197
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,880
paid for these hefty new sim cards a

198
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,720
very helpful employee actually told me

199
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,880
hey why don't you just sign up now and

200
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
top them up later we'll activate this

201
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,120
right now and i was surprised to hear

202
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,400
that this is actually an option so

203
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
that actually worked i just obtained a

204
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,560
new sim card without paying absolutely

205
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,720
anything other than my personal data of

206
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,960
course

207
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,479
and the final step

208
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,479
is to

209
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,280
choose the applications we want to

210
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,240
use

211
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
to search the target number within

212
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,759
and for this we can let's say

213
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,680
categorize the target applications in

214
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,039
three

215
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,960
four main categories first on the top

216
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,479
row we have the big social media

217
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,680
applications

218
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
on the second roll on the left we can

219
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,599
see the biggest messaging apps like

220
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,319
whatsapp viber and facebook's messenger

221
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,639
on the right though we have the security

222
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,800
and privacy focusing in messaging apps

223
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
the telegram signal

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
are good examples and finally on this

225
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,479
last role

226
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,319
we can see some applications that are

227
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,479
critical for specific regions for

228
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,800
instance vcontact is pretty big on

229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,080
russia

230
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,960
wechat is the de facto chat application

231
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,440
in china and line is also very very

232
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,400
popular in japan

233
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
all right now that we have everything

234
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,240
set up let's see how this trick looks

235
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,599
like

236
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,280
we'll use telegram for demonstration

237
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,679
first we can see that we've registered

238
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,200
in telegram with our software account we

239
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,880
don't have any contacts yet

240
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,120
let's go ahead and create one we'll use

241
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,440
a question mark for our target account

242
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,360
we'll paste the number that we want to

243
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,920
get more intel about

244
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,880
save it and then get back to telegram

245
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,640
where we can see that immediately we

246
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,519
have someone that we can add as a friend

247
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,680
and we get some interesting info we get

248
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,200
the username we get the picture of

249
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,800
course

250
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,920
and this bio field

251
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,200
right this is manual effort how could we

252
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,519
possibly automate this what if we want

253
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,000
to script this

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,680
there are multiple solutions as we

255
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,000
discussed we can just load the

256
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,120
application in an emulator and

257
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,440
maybe script this using testing

258
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,080
frameworks to launch the app do the

259
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
lookup and then

260
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,839
pass the results

261
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,399
or if there is a web client available

262
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,640
for our application we can just reverse

263
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
engineer this and

264
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,880
use devtools for instance to

265
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,000
examine the flow and then scrape

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
any ue elements

267
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,640
alternatively and this is the

268
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,880
most effective solution we can just

269
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,800
reverse engineer the mobile clients for

270
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,120
our applications

271
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,240
but again

272
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,800
you might ask what about these services

273
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,959
that promote social media information

274
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,560
about target users services like syncme

275
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,040
thatstam.com or people

276
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,040
unfortunately they don't really work as

277
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,680
they're based on something that's

278
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,480
automated and easily accessible aka

279
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,000
easily abused

280
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,560
and this sort of functionality like fake

281
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,719
books graph is eventually stopped

282
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,399
okay so what can we do to

283
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,800
defend ourselves from this trick how can

284
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,560
we prevent

285
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,720
users from getting our personal info

286
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,839
through this

287
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,079
through the apps we use

288
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,519
the solution is to check our settings

289
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,360
and mind the defaults

290
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,680
unfortunately there is no solar bullet

291
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,600
we need a per application

292
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
solution

293
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
this also takes some digging

294
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,200
unfortunately in telegram for instance

295
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,040
the right knob to

296
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
change is under phone number and we need

297
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,279
to explicitly change it to this value to

298
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,800
nobody and only then the latter radio

299
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
option pops up allowing us to select my

300
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
contacts and make our number

301
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
uncompensable

302
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,320
let's talk about opsec

303
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,000
the first thing we need to keep in mind

304
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
is that should we decide to use a sock

305
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,399
puppet and reuse it all over the place

306
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,240
then this account might start getting

307
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,399
too much heat

308
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,560
and interesting correlations might come

309
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,000
up behind the scenes and the graphs that

310
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,480
all services use

311
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,880
to avoid this it's best to just create

312
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,120
new accounts every now and then or use a

313
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,240
different sock puppet per service

314
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,399
similarly reusing the same device for

315
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
multiple operations might introduce some

316
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,880
risk this time on our end ask the hot

317
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,880
address book of this same smartphone

318
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,959
should it be compromised or stolen could

319
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,000
end up profiling our operations

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,560
so the consideration here is to remember

321
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,000
to clean the device periodically

322
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,240
and finally the drainage you might know

323
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,399
bubble popping up on the target sent

324
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,560
revealing our account and operations

325
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,320
this is the worst possible side effect

326
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,279
of this complexing trick but fortunately

327
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,959
it's pretty rare

328
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,600
the solution is to just avoid repetition

329
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,519
where possible

330
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,959
as typically

331
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,639
this correlation

332
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,200
might take more than one search and the

333
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,040
good thing with this trick that we're

334
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,120
presenting here is that all you need is

335
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,880
just one lookup only just one search

336
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
but let's just let's just focus on this

337
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,720
scenario for a moment this is a serious

338
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,600
risk and it would be interesting to see

339
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,839
how possible it actually is for this to

340
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,360
happen

341
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,120
so i've had this idea for a while that

342
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,000
maybe we could use the privacy tools

343
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,959
offered to us by eu's gdpr the general

344
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,279
data protection regulation

345
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,800
to find out what exactly is held about

346
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,079
our user a target user and specifically

347
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,160
whether that includes any passive

348
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,720
correlations with other users that may

349
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,760
have fallen as contacts

350
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,279
of our user

351
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,600
so i decided to try it out in telegram

352
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,880
specifically

353
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,360
you can get all the data that's kept

354
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,079
about you through a ddpr bot as we see

355
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,920
in the faq

356
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
using this very simple to use port all

357
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,560
we need is just two messages to slash

358
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,680
commands to request our data download it

359
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,000
from the desktop app and then finally

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
export it in a human-friendly html

361
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
format and browse it easily to find out

362
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,760
there's actually no mention of our soft

363
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,680
puppet the one we just used to search

364
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
this target account

365
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,320
and this is of course just an example

366
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,800
telegram is a privacy oriented app

367
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,120
expectedly it doesn't really hold any

368
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
creepy data

369
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,040
but let's just keep this tool in our

370
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,680
heads for other applications we might

371
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,120
not be so innocent

372
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,120
okay with all that in mind let's now

373
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,040
summarize what we know about this trick

374
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
it's gains and losses first

375
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,760
it's ease of use us we need no crazy

376
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,240
skills nor any specialized software or

377
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,440
hardware to perform it secondly it's

378
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,839
hard for applications to block and even

379
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,399
harder to detect that it's

380
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,639
that this feature is being abused

381
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,120
let me dive deeper here for a second we

382
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
shouldn't forget that this is based on a

383
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,360
feature contact uploading is a ux

384
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,120
functionality to help you get started

385
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,519
with a given service and find friends

386
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,360
and with regards to detection

387
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,800
remember that address books are

388
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,959
inherently large and most times this is

389
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,480
implemented with a single request to the

390
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,199
back end so if you've done eurovis

391
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,800
engineering and you've successfully

392
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,360
scripted a contact sync lookup all you

393
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,680
need to search multiple numbers at once

394
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,399
is just one request

395
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,519
also it boasts great performance again

396
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,360
if you've reversed the api the lookup

397
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,160
call is instant it takes milliseconds

398
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,480
compare that to waiting for an emulator

399
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,959
to boot the app to be launched and then

400
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,959
ue buttons to be clicked

401
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,639
and that's before results are actually

402
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,480
fetched and then passed so the

403
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,399
difference here is massive

404
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,959
finally it offers solid result

405
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,800
confidence

406
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,079
effectively

407
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,639
low to zero false positive hits

408
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,959
compare that to the fuzzy results that

409
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,040
for instance a search fixer would

410
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,160
provide

411
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,079
there are of course some downsides like

412
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,079
for starters it's actually hard to

413
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,519
automate this trick

414
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,120
as we saw this takes some reverse

415
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,800
engineering which usually takes both

416
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,560
time and skill

417
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,199
even once the apis are reversed you also

418
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,279
need to constantly monitor its results

419
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,360
and keep an eye out for version updates

420
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
or changes in the format

421
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,720
this however is also true for other

422
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,639
techniques like scraping web results

423
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,040
open up's web clients

424
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,360
also you need to typically

425
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,440
have an active session to even perform

426
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,839
these requests so factor in additional

427
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,920
reverse engineering effort for the login

428
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,639
process and some talking juggling after

429
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,759
that

430
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,360
and finally

431
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,759
should we decide to use soft puppets and

432
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,680
be reasonably powerful paranoid about

433
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,000
our opsec we'll have to accommodate for

434
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,839
the overhead of managing all these

435
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,680
accounts and keeping them active

436
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,279
before we go uh here's a list of good

437
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,680
awesome references good sources for

438
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
awesome stuff first we have awesome

439
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,639
curious the prolific that's awesome guy

440
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,680
in twitter

441
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,639
and of course the awesome ocean list on

442
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,600
github but most importantly install

443
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
techniques.com are great source of

444
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
diagrams however unfortunately the juice

445
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,800
is now hidden all these cool diagrams

446
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,959
are not even available on the wayback

447
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,160
machine

448
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,320
so it might take some digging to

449
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,160
actually find these

450
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,880
uh nice paths

451
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
and that's all for today actually i'd

452
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,079
like to thank you again uh thanks

453
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,320
to cuba saxenos for their overall help

454
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,279
with the slides and spot on qa advice

455
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,480
i would like to thank my childhood

456
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,160
friend nick for that foreign sim card

457
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
that featured briefly

458
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,560
and last but not least delta my partner

459
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,399
in crime in the army's red team helping

460
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,880
out for helping me out in this race to

461
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,599
find sim cards folders or puppets

462
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,119
that's all folks

463
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
hope you enjoyed it and if you haven't

464
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,280
fallen asleep yet there's a neat little

465
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
awesome challenge coming up so stay

466
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,039
tuned for a chance to win a wii prize
