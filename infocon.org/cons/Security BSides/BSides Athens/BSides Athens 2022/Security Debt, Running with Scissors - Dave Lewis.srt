1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,799
hi there and welcome thank you all for

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,040
having me here at besides athens as

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,120
virtual as it is i hope that next year

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,040
we'll be able to do this in person so

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,120
i'm dave lewis and my talk today is

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,880
security debt and running with scissors

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,560
and we'll get into what that means in

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,720
just a second

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,560
so i've been in security now for the

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,119
better part of 30 years and i have done

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,960
pretty much every role along the way up

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,199
to and including being a cso for a power

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,280
company and i have always been of a

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,680
hacker mind uh when i got started back

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,000
in 1983. i

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,559
hate that i can say that um i was really

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,239
having a good time you know duping video

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,680
games telling my kids in school that

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,360
sort of fun stuff

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,160
and well time has skipped ahead on us as

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,520
it always does

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
and now i'm a pretty much grizzled old

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,480
graybeard and a rather frequent coffee

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,360
drinker

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,320
um

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,440
and it's been interesting over the last

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,559
couple years during the course of the

28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,760
pandemic

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
i got into a couple of side ventures of

30
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,520
being uh involved with a whiskey

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,360
distillery as well as a soccer club here

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,400
in canada

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,080
and it's been uh it's been really

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
interesting to be able to you know try

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,920
different things even though we have

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,840
been and for a large part of it locked

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,960
down

38
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,720
but now hopefully we are coming to a

39
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,119
better place i want to believe i also

40
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,040
would love it if this virus would just

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,560
go away

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,360
so i am canadian uh so sorry about that

43
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,080
um it is you know running joke here in

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,040
canada

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,479
um

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,799
and you know we have to keep our wits

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,880
about ourselves because you know so many

48
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,920
times we have issues that crop up

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,600
and we often forget about the human

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,200
element so we have to be very cognizant

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
that we are taking time to take care of

52
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,439
our own mental health as well as those

53
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,040
around us so

54
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,240
having a good laugh every once in a

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,720
while doesn't hurt because we have far

56
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,200
too many soul-crushing meetings and you

57
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,880
know what you know we have to be very

58
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,439
cognizant of that because

59
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,040
there are better ways to do things and

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,399
over the course of the last couple years

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,560
we've actually found that we can be very

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,079
productive as security professionals in

63
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,878
this climate so that has been a real

64
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,200
bonus in that regard

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,840
so i myself identify as a hacker and

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,920
that means that well most of the world

67
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,000
is not a big fan of us

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,400
hackers quite literally for me is a term

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,080
of someone with an innate curiosity

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,520
about how things work

71
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,800
how we can take them apart put them back

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
together again and the criminal side of

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
things is something that i refer to as

74
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,200
the attacker so we have to make sure

75
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
that we are owning our own lingua franca

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,519
because otherwise the media will spin it

77
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,040
for us

78
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,160
so back many years ago i got my first

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,720
apartment back many years ago

80
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,440
and the first thing i did after my folks

81
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,879
drove off and it was just my roommate

82
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,160
and i was i grabbed a pair of scissors

83
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,640
and i ran around the apartment and my

84
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,239
roommate thought i had completely lost

85
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,959
my mind and wasn't too far from

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,319
incorrect he wasn't too far from the

87
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,840
right

88
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,080
you get me um

89
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,920
so i i just thought it was an ultimate

90
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
act of rebellion not taking into account

91
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,080
that this could have been a rather

92
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,480
unfortunate accident if i had tripped

93
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,519
and this is really how i like to frame

94
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,840
security debt now for me security debt

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,760
is a technical debt that has manifested

96
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,120
a security issue and we'll talk about

97
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
that a little bit more later

98
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
and it is very much akin to running

99
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,959
around with a pair of scissors in your

100
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,239
hand

101
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,799
seemed like a good idea at the time

102
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,080
so we have to make sure that we're

103
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,000
looking at how we're doing security or

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,840
in our environment and you know just

105
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,519
because something's inside your firewall

106
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,239
doesn't mean it's necessarily secure

107
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,080
because i have worked in an organization

108
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,840
in the past where that was actually said

109
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,720
to me by a cio and the problem here was

110
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,799
that you know security wasn't part of

111
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
the equation it was a flat network

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
and the phrase that was said to me was

113
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,840
that we trust everyone who works here

114
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
which is all well and good because you

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
know ransomware trusts everybody too

116
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,799
they trust us to make mistakes

117
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,640
ransomware really is the debt collector

118
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,159
for security debt and we have to make

119
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,239
sure that we are not making it easier

120
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,760
for attackers to be able to get their

121
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,840
job done

122
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,439
another thing here too is you know we

123
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,959
all like to be environmentally friendly

124
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,560
which is a good thing except when it

125
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,040
comes to passwords now i stole this from

126
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,279
my friend karen elzary and you know what

127
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,279
this is a great idea here because we

128
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,880
have to make sure that we are not

129
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
recycling passwords we are not reusing

130
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,040
them on multiple sites from our internet

131
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
banking to you know whatever it happens

132
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,440
to be because the attackers know this

133
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
and they will go after sites and

134
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,800
compromise them and then reuse those

135
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,240
credentials to try and escalate their

136
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,840
privilege so we've got to make sure that

137
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,440
we are not making their jobs any easier

138
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,360
because as a security professional we

139
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,919
always feel like this or at least i do

140
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,000
and hopefully we can get to a better

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
place so we are not feeling like this

142
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
constantly

143
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
so when we're born into this world we

144
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,880
have to understand that we are

145
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,440
defaulting to trust now malcolm gladwell

146
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,199
talked about this in his book talking to

147
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,040
strangers that when we're born in this

148
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
world we are looking for food we are

149
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
looking for shelter we are looking to be

150
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,919
safe

151
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,560
and as a result we don't have an innate

152
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,039
understanding as to what it means to be

153
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,960
you know securing our environment and

154
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,479
making sure that you know attackers

155
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,280
can't cause us undue harm we are just

156
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,759
reaching out and hoping for the best

157
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,639
now

158
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,360
this does not translate into the modern

159
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,320
uh world and when i say that from the

160
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,000
perspective of computer security we want

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,080
to make sure that we are trust but

162
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,360
verify and verify again because we can't

163
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,600
just accept at face value that someone

164
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,840
is who they say they are we have to make

165
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,639
sure that trust is a absolute factor in

166
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,039
everything we do but it's established

167
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
trust because trust is ephemeral we want

168
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,199
to make sure that we are not just saying

169
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,120
oh i trust frank because frank is

170
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,720
somebody i've always known

171
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,400
because frank might not be frank behind

172
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,840
the keyboard anymore frank might have

173
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,600
lost control of his own credentials so

174
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,720
we have to always keep that in mind

175
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,639
because in the last couple years we've

176
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,720
really seen that our security paradigm

177
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,080
has shifted our threats are different

178
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,440
i've been very fortunate that i've been

179
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,160
a home office user for many years

180
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,080
so a lot of this was old hat for me but

181
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,240
too many people have you know really had

182
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,560
a hard time adjusting because before the

183
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
pandemic we had folks that would say oh

184
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,080
i'm going to work from home on friday

185
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,000
which was code for you know i'm going

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,680
off to the islands or i'm going off to

187
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,120
the cottage or whatever it happens to be

188
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,080
in your respective jurisdictions um

189
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,479
and it has really changed how we view

190
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,160
the world so

191
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,520
in addition to the threats that we have

192
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,800
to deal with you know cats running

193
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,479
across keyboards dogs chewing through

194
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,440
cables

195
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,759
kids tapping on computers when they

196
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,440
shouldn't

197
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,720
we have to make sure that we also

198
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,919
understand the human element as i

199
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,759
mentioned before because the human

200
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,440
element really does factor into security

201
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
debt as well because we want to make

202
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,160
sure that we're being aware that you

203
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,520
know people are in a different

204
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,360
environment they are really trying very

205
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,160
hard to get their jobs done in a safe

206
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,560
and secure manner and they're they're

207
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,720
worried about you know how are they

208
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
going to be able to pay their bills so

209
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,840
you know attackers know this and they

210
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,319
tend to prey on this using uh various

211
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,680
phishing techniques and things to that

212
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
effect so we want to make sure that

213
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
we're giving them tools that are going

214
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
to help democratize security and keep

215
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,840
them safe and secure at the same

216
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,440
time because security debt as i

217
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,360
mentioned earlier is really it's about a

218
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,120
for me is a technological debt that has

219
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,440
manifested a security issue and i really

220
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,440
like to do to make that absolute

221
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,199
distinction because i have been in too

222
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,199
many environments in the past where

223
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,280
you know security debt really had become

224
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,080
a wide open problem you know os2 warp

225
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,160
systems running hvac that were attached

226
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,479
to the internet um all sorts of really

227
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,400
odd things like that

228
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,759
an old

229
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,560
polycom device that was configured to

230
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,240
access the internet

231
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,479
using default credentials and also with

232
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,120
the ability to change that to allow ssh

233
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,440
through it into the network

234
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,039
these are kind of things that you might

235
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,720
not think about at the time but they do

236
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,639
manifest as a security issue once the

237
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,120
attackers find them as absolutely but we

238
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,479
want to make sure that we're managing

239
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,440
that risk to our environments

240
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,479
because things like heartbleed and log4j

241
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,080
these are going to continue to happen

242
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
because when organizations are using

243
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,759
open source software and to be clear

244
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,879
there's nothing wrong with the open

245
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,400
source software but they have to be able

246
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,360
to manage the risk associated with it

247
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,759
because at the time you know harpley's

248
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,319
ssl or sorry the ssl library rather was

249
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,240
being used by e-commerce sites to plant

250
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,919
all over the planet like everybody was

251
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,240
using it but at that point in time there

252
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,599
was about one and a half people

253
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,679
dedicated to maintaining that particular

254
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,880
library

255
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,799
thankfully that has been remedied and

256
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,559
they are well financed and the rest of

257
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,760
it but

258
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,919
it's just one example of many

259
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,279
there are all sorts of open source

260
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,560
libraries that find their way into

261
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
commercial software that may not be

262
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,080
properly maintained so we want to make

263
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,839
sure that we are keeping on top of that

264
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,320
and not introducing undue risk into our

265
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,519
environment

266
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,959
because there's different ways to you

267
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,560
know handle risk you know do we avoid it

268
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,959
accept it reduce transfer

269
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,959
the thing here that really bothers me is

270
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,040
far too often i see organizations just

271
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,200
accept the risk they sign it off and

272
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,720
move on and

273
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
it's forgotten you know that piece of

274
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,320
paper ends up in a desk drawer or it's

275
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
you know filed off in some obscure part

276
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,519
of your computer that you never look at

277
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,760
again

278
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,360
and that's a problem

279
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,399
because

280
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,839
there's also the pieces you know who is

281
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,399
accepting that risk who has the ability

282
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,959
to accept the risk in your organization

283
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,880
and what's your plan to deal with it in

284
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,279
the future

285
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,480
because things like this are going to

286
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,320
continue to happen i've seen this in far

287
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
too many environments where a beige

288
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,399
desktop was in production

289
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,880
running mission critical code written by

290
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,279
a summer student that nobody knew how to

291
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,880
port it off and they couldn't afford to

292
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,000
shut it down

293
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,519
because it was running a critical

294
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,800
function

295
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,360
this is just one example of many that

296
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,279
far too many organizations have in their

297
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,399
environments

298
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,600
last couple of years i've been doing

299
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,680
sisa roundtables roughly about one per

300
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,640
week

301
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,880
and this has been a topic that has come

302
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,560
up over and over again you know these

303
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,000
old deprecated systems that we're

304
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,320
running that are not maintained not

305
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
patched

306
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,959
but it's okay because we have a firewall

307
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,360
it's an unfortunate notion that

308
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,279
people put a little bit too much

309
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,959
investment into the idea of a

310
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,800
traditional perimeter you know the

311
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,480
castle wall the moat and all the rest of

312
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,040
it really that has been a deprecated

313
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,040
notion for many many years

314
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,040
we want to look at the access perimeter

315
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,959
is or rather the perimeter as being

316
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,480
anywhere an access decision is being

317
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,399
made and we have to be very clear on

318
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,760
that

319
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,839
so just accepting the risk is not going

320
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,720
to help you it is going to buy you time

321
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,519
and it's usually driven out of a it

322
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,120
project you know the project manager

323
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,480
just wants to get the end of job so they

324
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,399
accept the risk they move on and the

325
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,279
risk is

326
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,959
forgotten so

327
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,440
this can't continue

328
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,480
because

329
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,600
when we're looking at it from a

330
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,720
project-based perspective there's

331
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,320
usually no sunset provision for that

332
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
particular project so when that project

333
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,040
is built

334
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,800
it could be meant to last for three

335
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,320
years five years whatever it happens to

336
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,240
be but then in most organizations it'll

337
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,800
limp on for 10 to 20 years

338
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,480
and this is a real problem when they're

339
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,240
not being patched not being maintained

340
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
not being configured the people who

341
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,320
installed it didn't properly document it

342
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,480
and have now left the company

343
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,680
these are the kind of things we have to

344
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,120
make sure that we're keeping on top of

345
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,160
on a consistent basis

346
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,399
and when you're looking at security in

347
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,000
your environment rather

348
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,600
you want to understand what are those

349
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,959
business priorities for your

350
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,959
organization you know running around

351
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,720
with your hair on fire saying oh this is

352
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,240
really bad

353
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,800
has extremely limited utility you want

354
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
to look at it as you know what are the

355
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,839
outcomes you're trying to achieve from a

356
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,320
security perspective in order to satisfy

357
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,959
the aspirations of your business

358
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,360
fundamentally that's it at its core so

359
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,040
if you don't understand what it is

360
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,399
you're securing in your business you

361
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,839
know you're not just saying you know the

362
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,200
answer is no

363
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,160
um

364
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,519
you're going to put yourself in a bit of

365
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,519
a disadvantage you want to make sure you

366
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,120
clearly understand what the mission of

367
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
your organization is so that you can

368
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,000
best protect it

369
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,360
and from a business can you know context

370
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
you know what is most important what are

371
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
they like i was talking about what are

372
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
they trying to achieve but we also have

373
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,800
to make sure that you know we're not

374
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,639
negatively impacting systems or in our

375
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,000
environment

376
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,839
we have to be able to facilitate that

377
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,680
conversation with the developers with

378
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,760
the business units so that they don't

379
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,600
just stand up in application hope for

380
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
the best

381
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,720
in the past i was dealing with one

382
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,120
organization who built out a web

383
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,440
application and put it live

384
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,240
somehow bypassed security altogether and

385
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
the very first day it went live

386
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,839
they came to me and said oh we need a

387
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,320
security review

388
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,560
nothing like being timely

389
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,399
the problem here is the first thing i

390
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,040
did was view source on the web page

391
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,639
and right there commented out in the

392
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,959
code was the username and password for

393
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,120
admin and password

394
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,200
i wish i was joking but this was

395
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,279
actually a thing what was made it worse

396
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,279
was the particular manager for that

397
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,440
development team looked at me and said

398
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,720
you've hacked our application

399
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,720
i had to take a moment's pause

400
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,639
that was a very difficult moment for me

401
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,480
because i wanted to scream and pull my

402
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,600
hair out but

403
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
that wouldn't have accomplished anything

404
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,079
i at that moment realized that there was

405
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,040
a failure on my part and my team's part

406
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,959
that we didn't clearly communicate to

407
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,040
the organization what we expected from

408
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,279
them from a security perspective

409
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,600
and they clearly didn't have any

410
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
understanding of that so rather than

411
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,760
vilifying the users i had to find a way

412
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,560
to have that conversation to better

413
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,279
impart what security issues we needed to

414
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,199
take care of so that this didn't

415
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,399
continue in the future

416
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,959
now we talked about project managers and

417
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,399
how sometimes you would see you know

418
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,000
risks being accepted by the wrong people

419
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,760
but you know within your own business

420
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,079
ask yourself this question who has the

421
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,279
ability to accept risk

422
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,600
typically it ends up in the c suite but

423
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,000
not every organization understands that

424
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,079
and far too often i'll see organizations

425
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,480
that are accepting risk that are

426
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,160
individuals that have no capacity or

427
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,199
authority to accept a risk

428
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,360
one organization that i was at and i

429
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,839
left shortly after this was we had done

430
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,920
an entirely entire rather vulnerability

431
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,480
assessment of the organization found

432
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,920
absolute

433
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,120
plethora of

434
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,720
organizational issues

435
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,600
vulnerabilities configuration issues

436
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,120
imagine a flat network that spans the

437
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
globe

438
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,760
and we presented them to the head of i.t

439
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,000
um wasn't even the cio who's the i.t

440
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,120
manager

441
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,639
or director rather for that particular

442
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,160
part of the organization and he said

443
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,839
that's okay we'll just accept the risk

444
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,120
this was very very difficult to

445
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,480
wrap my head around at the time because

446
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,720
at no point was he doing anything to

447
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,560
mitigate the issues

448
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,440
and

449
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,279
it was really a trivial exercise for an

450
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,800
attacker to breach that particular

451
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,360
organization i sincerely hope that they

452
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,839
have long since fixed these issues but

453
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,199
it was um

454
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,720
not something that they were really keen

455
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,240
to take a

456
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
serious look at at the time

457
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,199
so when you're looking at you know the

458
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,480
various security issues within your

459
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,560
organizations what those risks are and

460
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,320
when i say the risks you know i mean it

461
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
from quite literally an expectation of

462
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,320
loss if this particular system goes down

463
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,680
how much is that going to impact the

464
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,279
business and how is it going to impact

465
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,639
the business you know how can you

466
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,279
quantify that and how can you improve

467
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,880
the process in order to make sure that

468
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,639
those risks are being dealt with

469
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,959
so you know do you have a risk register

470
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,880
um are you tracking these risks to end

471
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
of job are you able to clearly

472
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,480
communicate this to the auditors when

473
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,720
they come calling and wow they come

474
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,120
calling

475
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,600
pardon me take a little water break

476
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
so we want to make sure that we have a

477
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,560
clear you know defined repeatable

478
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,639
process on how we can address this and

479
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,399
reduce the risk in our organization

480
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,160
fundamentally

481
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,880
because if these risks are not addressed

482
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,600
over time they compound

483
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,920
and when you add in new systems add in

484
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,320
new projects over time you end up with a

485
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,199
layer of digital detritus that really

486
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,040
can cause an

487
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,759
unbelievable number of issues and if an

488
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,440
attacker is able to breach one system

489
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,800
all of a sudden they have the ability

490
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
and capacity to pivot from one system to

491
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,720
another and we don't want to make their

492
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,199
job any easier than it already is

493
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,920
we want to make sure that we are not

494
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,680
allowing you know these issues to

495
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,079
languish we have because you know

496
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,160
fundamentally that danger does grow over

497
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
time and if we have a lack of action on

498
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,120
our part

499
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,680
it just presents targets of opportunity

500
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,560
rather

501
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,880
for the attacker

502
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,360
and when we layer in things like iot

503
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,839
the risks explode

504
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,360
they are

505
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,079
many and many many issues that come with

506
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,920
this and i'm not talking just simply

507
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,839
about consumer grade croft of you know

508
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,079
the baby monitors and the wireless light

509
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,000
bulbs and things like that but you know

510
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,079
control systems that are being used to

511
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,720
do manufacturing to handle

512
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,000
control systems for power water and so

513
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,280
on

514
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,640
all of these things if they are not

515
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,079
properly maintained

516
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,760
we have a real problem and there is an

517
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,199
adversarial relationship that i've seen

518
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,359
historically between ot and it groups

519
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,119
within organizations that handle these

520
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,160
systems

521
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
we have to find a way to build that

522
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,799
bridge to make sure that we're avoiding

523
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,440
these security issues because as these

524
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
things crop up they're going to add

525
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,360
greater and greater levels of complexity

526
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,280
in order to what in order to

527
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,840
try that again

528
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
to for our systems that we need to

529
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840
protect and we have to go through that

530
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
lather rinse repeat

531
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,679
and as we add in multiple systems that

532
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,039
becomes far more difficult to address

533
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,799
we can't just be that flaming sword of

534
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,240
justice is running down the hall and

535
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,640
saying the answer is still no and we

536
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,000
have to make sure that when we make our

537
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
slides that the color of the letters on

538
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,600
the slide are the right color so you can

539
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,039
actually read it which says the flaming

540
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,039
sword of justice so that refers to

541
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,360
somebody that i knew many years ago who

542
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
really his answer to everything was no

543
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,679
and this does nothing to improve

544
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,480
security for an organization

545
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,720
that's an old-school old-school dated

546
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,840
approach and it's really ineffective you

547
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,679
know if we are not taking time to

548
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,520
empower the organization to help them

549
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,600
better understand how to secure the

550
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
environment

551
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,840
it's doing nothing to improve matters

552
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,360
because that perimeter is not what it

553
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,880
used to be

554
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,120
it's everywhere anywhere an access

555
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,440
decision is being made

556
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,919
because data breaches are happening and

557
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,160
they're happening all the time and it

558
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,840
really does seem in a lot of cases like

559
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,120
you know everybody wants one

560
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,360
so we want to make sure that that is not

561
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,679
going to continue as a trend back in

562
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,679
2012 i started tracking data breaches

563
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,520
and there was a few here and there you

564
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,799
know i think the biggest one at the time

565
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,559
was six and a half million records which

566
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,880
was pretty huge back then but nowadays

567
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,400
we're dealing with orders of magnitude

568
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,880
of billions of records being compromised

569
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,960
we can do better

570
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,559
when we look at it and we see that a lot

571
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,280
of the breaches are handled or rather

572
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,880
facilitated through weak credentials

573
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,240
like qwerty password123 things like that

574
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,919
vilifying the users isn't going to help

575
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,600
we have to give them better tools we

576
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,200
have to give them better ways to protect

577
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,840
things because if it's a weak unpatched

578
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,919
device that's on us if it's a bad

579
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,400
password that's also on us and i don't

580
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,240
expect non-technical people to be

581
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,559
computer savvy so we want to give them

582
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
something that is going to help protect

583
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,000
their organization

584
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
and make it as easy as possible for them

585
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,600
to be safe and secure so they can you

586
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,640
know concentrate on their core

587
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
competencies

588
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,480
continuous trusted acts is a great way

589
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,160
to do this i mean some people say zero

590
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,640
trust i like it this way because

591
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,080
a lot of times i've heard people spit on

592
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,799
the floor when they say zero trust

593
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,480
xero trust really is fundamentally about

594
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,240
reducing risk so if you say continuous

595
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,600
trust and access is making sure that

596
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,280
you're going through and approving all

597
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,679
the users devices and applications on a

598
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,679
continuous basis because as i said trust

599
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,520
is ephemeral

600
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,039
this will help improve matters in the

601
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,640
longer term

602
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,080
and you want to make sure that security

603
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,320
is part of your mission overall

604
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,159
so just saying you know you're one

605
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,280
little security group running around

606
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,039
terrorizing you know people in your

607
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,880
organization saying you know do this or

608
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,720
bad things will happen isn't going to

609
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,559
help improve matters we want to make

610
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,480
sure that security it becomes part of

611
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,120
the fabric the dna fundamentally of your

612
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,720
organization

613
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,480
because as a security professional i

614
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,240
shouldn't have to exist this should be

615
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,720
part of the overall structure but again

616
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,240
going back to when we're born into the

617
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,080
world as malcolm gladwell said we

618
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,240
default to trust and we want to make

619
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,400
sure that we are helping organizations

620
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,640
better understand this because you know

621
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,520
security people are a little different

622
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,360
we have to get away from the bailing and

623
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,679
bailing wire and duct tape approach to

624
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,280
putting our systems together we have to

625
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,760
have clear strategies in order to get to

626
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,280
that better place

627
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,200
and we do that through having clear and

628
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,440
concise planning

629
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,120
you want to trust but verify within your

630
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,720
organization you need to establish trust

631
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,480
in your user identities devices

632
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,559
applications we've got to sanitize our

633
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,159
inputs and outputs for our applications

634
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,000
i mean sql injection has been on the os

635
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,400
top 10 since the beginning it's still

636
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,880
there still one of the absolute biggest

637
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,360
ways for attackers to breach systems and

638
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,640
we have to make sure that we're patching

639
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,960
things we can't just we worried about

640
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,559
you know the zero days i'm more

641
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:31,919
fundamentally worried about the 100 day

642
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,520
the 200-day vulnerability that hasn't

643
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,640
been addressed

644
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,520
that

645
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
database service pack that has not been

646
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,200
applied for three years these are the

647
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,840
kind of things that keep me up at night

648
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,360
so if we go through it and we look at

649
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,280
zero trust or continuous trusted access

650
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,559
however you want to call it it's about

651
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,559
reducing risk so fundamentally you want

652
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,559
to go through establish trust and user

653
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,840
identities

654
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,760
evaluate the device

655
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,520
look at enforcing policies and make sure

656
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
that you know dave from canada is not

657
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,360
suddenly showing up in mykonos attaching

658
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,120
to your systems when i'm not actually on

659
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,559
that side of the planet these are kind

660
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,440
of things you want to make sure you're

661
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,480
on top of

662
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,240
securing the connections to all of your

663
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,080
applications because you don't want me

664
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,159
sitting at a coffee shop here in canada

665
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,240
accessing your email systems when i

666
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,960
don't work for you

667
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,120
and you want to make sure that you're

668
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,880
going through all of that data you're

669
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
collecting and looking for anomalies

670
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,400
because they will continue to happen

671
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,320
because attackers are going to always be

672
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,760
looking for ways to get into your

673
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,280
systems

674
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,360
so here's a real quick flow user

675
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,280
requests access to an application we

676
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,799
establish trust on them using say

677
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,960
multi-factor authentication or

678
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,640
passwordless you know these are ways to

679
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,840
do a better job of

680
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,799
authentication uh looking at the

681
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,400
trustworthiness device is it running

682
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,679
windows me

683
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,799
um

684
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,640
in my web blogs for my own site i have

685
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,240
actually seen that recently it wasn't

686
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,159
when it was windows 98

687
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,679
somebody was trying to access my website

688
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,600
and i'm sure that was a horrible user

689
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,880
experience for them

690
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,400
enforcing policies on user device

691
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,320
combination make sure you know that dave

692
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,120
is in canada not in mykonos or something

693
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,280
or athens for example

694
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,120
and making sure that you then build in a

695
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,200
secure connection to the application in

696
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,440
once you've done all of that go through

697
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,880
and look for those anomalies

698
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
so if you take nothing else away from

699
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,480
this talk today i need you to go and

700
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,480
look up web authen it is a open standard

701
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,400
that really is about passwordless

702
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
authentication and this is a way to make

703
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,360
it easier for the users to you know

704
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,880
access their systems we want to make

705
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,799
sure that we are making things that are

706
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,679
going to democratize security

707
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,440
making it as easy as possible for people

708
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,679
to get their jobs done

709
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,440
we've learned a lot of lessons along the

710
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,000
way the problem is putting those into

711
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,080
action we want to make sure that we are

712
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
facilitating a better conversation

713
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,159
because as security practitioners we

714
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,400
have really gotten to that place where

715
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,919
we are now at the adults table we have

716
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,159
we're being taken seriously so we have

717
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,320
to make sure that we capitalize on that

718
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,159
opportunity to better secure the

719
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,080
environment by being a champion for the

720
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,360
environment

721
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,919
of our organizations to better secure

722
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,039
them

723
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,400
there are a lot of problems out there

724
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,679
we've got to make sure that we're not

725
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,039
worried about the sharks that are

726
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,120
patrolling the waters we got to look at

727
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,240
the ocean

728
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,400
the ocean is really

729
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,000
the bigger threat and often overlooked

730
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,120
we want to make sure that we're building

731
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,880
a safe and secure future and you're

732
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,799
using multi-factor authentication using

733
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,200
password lists making sure that you are

734
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
reducing security debt in your

735
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,039
environment are all ways to better

736
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,400
improve things because

737
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,760
we don't need to cause ourselves

738
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,039
problems we got enough of them to

739
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,120
contend with as it is

740
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,320
thank you very much for having me

741
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,919
besides athens hopefully i'll be able to

742
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,000
do this in person in the future

743
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
if you want to drop me an email at

744
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,840
gattica cisco.com or find me on twitter

745
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,000
at gattaca it is truly an honor to be

746
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,840
able to be part of this again today and

747
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,520
uh thank you and

748
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,400
